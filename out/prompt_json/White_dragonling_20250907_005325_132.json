    "video_prompt": "A cute white dragon subtly shifts its weight on the branch. Its chest gently rises and falls as it breathes. Water droplets on its scales shimmer and slide slightly, some falling off. The leaves around it subtly sway as if caught in a gentle breeze. The dragon's ears twitch slightly, and its head turns minimally to the side. Its eye blinks slowly, reflecting the bright light of the sun. The camera performs a very subtle, slow zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA cute, realistic, baby ice dragon with sparkling white and light blue scales, glistening with tiny water droplets or frost, is perched on a dark, textured tree branch. The dragon has large, innocent blue eyes with dark pupils, an adorable subtly pink nose with one small whisker, and short, translucent-pink inner ears. Its back features crystalline, spiky protrusions consistent with an ice-like texture. The composition is a portrait-style eye-level shot, focusing on the dragon's upper body and head, with a slightly upward and forward gaze, conveying curiosity and gentleness.\n\nThe lighting is natural and bright, with a strong, soft sunbeam emanating from the top right, creating a distinct lens flare that illuminates parts of the dragon and background. The background is a gently blurred natural environment, featuring soft green foliage on the left and foreground, and a light blue sky with subtle cloud hints, suggesting a peaceful outdoor setting. The overall atmosphere is magical, serene, and enchanting.\n\n**Visual elements:** Cute baby ice dragon, sparkling white and light blue scales, water droplets/frost, blue eyes, pink nose, whisker, translucent-pink ears, crystalline spiky protrusions, dark tree branch, green foliage.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, fantasy, detailed, cute, adorable.\n\n**Composition:** Portrait-style, eye-level, close-up on dragon's head and upper body, shallow depth of field.\n\n**Colors:** Dominantly white, light blue, subtle pink, dark brown (branch), soft green (foliage), bright blue (sky).\n\n**Lighting:** Bright natural light, soft sunlight, strong sunbeam from top right, lens flare, illuminated features.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Magical, serene, enchanting, innocent, gentle, peaceful.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The dragon subtly shifts its weight, its chest gently rising and falling with breath. Water droplets shimmer and slide on its scales, some detaching. Leaves sway gently. Its ears twitch, and head turns minimally. An eye blinks slowly, reflecting light. The camera subtly zooms out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A cute white dragon suddenly roars, scales erupting with ice shards. Its massive wings unfurl explosively, creating a powerful gust that rips leaves from branches and sends them spiraling upwards. The branch violently splinters as the dragon launches itself into the sky, its eyes glowing fiercely. A sudden, blinding flash of light emanates from behind it, illuminating the chaotic scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The white dragon's scales ripple like liquid mercury, dissolving into shimmering mist that reforms as blooming crystal flowers. Its ears become delicate butterfly wings, gently fanning backwards, pulling water droplets upwards. The sun's rays reverse, drawing light from the dragon's eyes, causing them to glow from within with starlight. The branch morphs into a swirling nebula, pulling the dragon into a collapsing vortex of color, where time and space fold inward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly tracks forward, revealing the pristine white dragon perched on a mossy branch. A subtle breeze rustles the dewy leaves, catching the glitter on its scales before a sharp, cinematic zoom to reveal its piercing blue eye reflecting the sun. The creature's head dramatically cocks, its razor-sharp horns glinting before a swift, sweeping camera movement reveals its powerful tail, subtly twitching, as it suddenly lets out a whisper-soft sigh, a wisp of vapor rising from its nostrils.",
