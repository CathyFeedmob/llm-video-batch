  "video_prompt": "Subtle swaying of the child's dress and hair in a gentle breeze, soft flickering of stars in the night sky, blooming and slight swaying of the white flowers, very subtle shimmering/pulsing from the golden parts of the sphere as if it's a living entity, a slow, gentle zoom out.",
  "image_prompt": "A serene, painterly illustration in the style of Studio Ghibli, featuring a gentle, hopeful atmosphere. The scene captures a small child, with short brown hair, wearing a loose, flowing dress adorned with soft pastel and gold patterns, standing amidst a field of white flowers and green foliage. The child is looking upwards towards a stylized, enormous moon or planet, rendered in a striking abstract mix of black, gold, and light blue swirling patterns, reminiscent of liquid gold and marble.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by deep blues for the sky and distant landscapes, creating a sense of vastness and calm. Highlights of white for the stars and flowers, and shimmering gold and light blues for the celestial body, add a touch of fantasy and wonder. Lighting is soft and atmospheric, suggesting either twilight or a surreal luminous glow from the celestial object. The composition places the child slightly to the right, balanced by the massive celestial body on the left, leading the viewer's eye upwards. The overall mood is peaceful, curious, and whimsical.\n\n**Aspect ratio:** 9:16Portrait\n\n**Style:** Studio Ghibli, Painterly, Stylized, Abstract (for celestial body)\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, Atmospheric, Luminous\n\n**Colors:** Deep Blue, Gold, Light Blue, White, Pastel Green, Pastel Purple\n\n**Atmosphere:** Serene, Peaceful, Hopeful, Curious, Whimsical, Dreamlike",

  "refined_video_prompt": "The child's dress and hair gently sway. Stars delicately flicker. White flowers bloom and sway softly. Golden sphere subtly shimmers and pulses. The camera slowly zooms out.",
  "creative_video_prompt_1": "The golden sphere violently throbs and bursts with light, flinging its molten gold tendrils through the night! Flowers whip wildly, petals tearing away as if caught in a hurricane. The child's dress and hair thrash violently, she's battling an unseen gale. Stars explode and streak across the sky. The horizon rips open!",
  "creative_video_prompt_2": "The child's dress and hair unfurl like liquid light, reversing into their untouched state, then morphing into spectral flowers that drift upwards, defying gravity. Stars pulse erratically, forming impossible nebulae before dissolving into golden dust that rains down onto the sphere, causing its golden parts to ripple and expand like a living, breathing aurora. White flowers bloom and unbloom simultaneously, their petals transforming into delicate wings that lift them skyward and they ascend to the star-field above. The entire scene slowly contracts, folding in on itself like a collapsing dream.",
  "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping crane shot descends, revealing a child captivated by a swirling golden orb, their dress and hair gently swaying. As the camera dramatically pulls back, the white flowers subtly bloom and sway, their petals reflecting the soft flicker of distant stars. A faint, ethereal shimmer emanates from the orb, pulsating as if alive. The scene concludes with a slow, cinematic zoom out, revealing the vast, silent beauty of the moonlit landscape."
