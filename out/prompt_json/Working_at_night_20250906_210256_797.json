    "video_prompt": "A slight breath-like expansion and contraction of the character's chest, a subtle shift in the light from the desk lamp, casting a gentle flicker on the desk. The moon in the window glows softly, perhaps with a very faint, almost imperceptible pulsation. A few small, luminous dust motes gently drift in the beam of light from the lamp. The character's hair moves with a hint of sway as if very gently stirred by air.",
    "image_prompt": "A dreamlike, anime-style illustration of a young person with light blue hair and black over-ear headphones, wearing a salmon-colored hoodie, sitting at a wooden desk and typing on a laptop. They are positioned in front of a large window, through which a bright, full moon is visible in a light blue sky with abstract orange cloud-like shapes. The room is dimly lit, with the main light source coming from a desk lamp casting a warm, bright yellow glow over the desk and the person's right side. The desk also holds a container with pens/pencils and what appears to be a cup. To the left and right of the window, tall, open bookshelves are filled with books and various items. The flooring is a muted teal, and objects are scattered around. The overall aesthetic is characterized by a high contrast, with deep shadows and vibrant highlights, and strong outlines giving it a sketched or painted feel. The setting evokes a cozy, late-night study or work session.",
