  "video_prompt": "A camera slowly pans right, revealing the vibrant scene. Raindrops gently fall from the sky, creating subtle ripples on the lake and adding a shimmering effect to the reflections. The light breeze causes the leaves on the trees to subtly rustle and the grass in the foreground to sway gently. The balloons tied to the bicycle gently bob and sway with the air currents. The small flowers in the meadow gently shimmer in the light.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Visual Elements:** A vibrant, idyllic landscape featuring a wide, calm lake with ripples reflecting the sky. Along the lake's edge, a winding path is painted in the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The path curves gracefully, leading into the distance. Lush green grass with scattered wildflowers (small white, pink, and yellow daisies) covers the foreground and the sloping banks beside the path. A mature tree with a full green canopy stands on the left side of the path in the middle ground, and a dense line of similar green trees forms a forest borderline in the background, extending across the horizon.\n\nIn the lower foreground, a charming, light pink vintage-style bicycle rests on the grass, facing slightly right. The bicycle has a white seat and handlebars, chrome spokes, and black tires. A wicker basket overflowing with a diverse bouquet of bright, colorful flowers (red, yellow, blue, pink, purple, and orange daisies/chrysanthemums) is attached to the front handlebars. Behind the basket, a cluster of four colorful balloons (yellow, green, blue, and red) floats above the bicycle. Another arrangement of similar colorful flowers is in a white rectangular planter on the rear rack of the bicycle.\n\n**Sky & Atmosphere:** A bright azure blue sky with scattered fluffy white clouds. Two prominent, intersecting rainbows arc across the upper portion of the sky, creating an \"X\" shape. The rainbows are vivid and well-defined, with clear bands of color. There's a subtle atmospheric effect, possibly light rain streaks or shimmering light around the rainbows, giving a magical quality.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:** Low angle shot, placing the viewer's eye close to the ground, emphasizing the flowers and the bicycle. The rainbow path acts as a leading line, drawing the eye from the foreground deep into the scene. The lake fills the right side of the mid-ground and background. The intersecting rainbows dominate the upper sky, framing the scene.\n\n**Colors:** Extremely vibrant and saturated colors throughout. Dominant hues are the bright blues of the sky and water, the rich greens of the grass and trees, and the full spectrum of rainbow colors on the path and in the flowers/balloons. Pink for the bicycle.\n\n**Lighting:** Bright, natural daylight, as if bathed in soft morning or late afternoon sun. The lighting is even, casting minimal harsh shadows, contributing to the cheerful and serene atmosphere.\n\n**Style:** Dreamy, whimsical, and slightly illustrative, with a touch of a storybook or fantasy aesthetic. High detail, yet with a slightly smoothed, painterly feel. The overall mood is joyful, peaceful, and enchanting.\n\n**Artistic Considerations:** Crisp focus on the foreground elements (bicycle, flowers) with a gentle depth of field leading to the background. The textures of the grass, water, and flowers should be discernible. The overall impression should be one of cheerfulness and natural beauty infused with magical elements.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Camera pans right. Raindrops ripple the lake's surface, shimmering reflections. Leaves rustle, grass sways. Balloons bob on a bicycle. Flowers shimmer.",
  "creative_video_prompt_1": "A camera violently whips right. Rain lashes down, churning the lake into a turbulent frenzy. Trees thrash, leaves ripped by a gale. Balloons explode from the bike, rocketing skyward. Flowers spontaneously erupt, blooming in violent bursts across the meadow. The rainbow path pulsates with an unseen energy, its colors surging and receding with chaotic speed.",
  "creative_video_prompt_2": "The very air shimmers, not with rain, but with echoes of falling rainbows, their colors bleeding into the sky. The lake surface warps, reflecting impossible inverted landscapes. Balloons pulsate, expanding and contracting, their hues shifting wildly. Flowers in the meadow detach, spinning in ethereal dances, reforming into impossible\ngeometries. Every leaf, every blade of grass, twists and unwinds in a dance of pure, illogical motion.",
  "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic pan reveals a world transformed: two intertwining rainbows arc across a sky weeping glistening raindrops. The camera tracks forward, revealing a winding, rainbow-colored path beside a shimmering lake. A pink bicycle, laden with vibrant flowers and bobbing balloons, enters the frame. The camera slowly zooms into the swaying balloons, their reflections dancing on the water, before soaring upwards to showcase the full, ethereal beauty of the double rainbow. Rain continues to fall, creating a mystical, serene atmosphere."
