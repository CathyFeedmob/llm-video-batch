    "video_prompt": "Raindrops slowly slide down the glass, some merging together. Subtle fluctuations in the light and intensity of the fireworks, with slight shimmering of the water reflections within the drops. Distant city lights gently pulse and blur.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA stunning hyperrealistic nighttime shot through a wet window on a rainy night, showcasing a vibrant fireworks display. The foreground is dominated by countless, clear rain droplets of varying sizes clinging to the glass, each reflecting tiny, inverted, and magnified versions of the fireworks and city lights. Rain streaks are visible running down the glass between the droplets.\n\nIn the midground and background, out-of-focus but distinct fireworks explode in brilliant bursts of color against a dark, stormy blue and purple sky. One large, multi-colored (red, blue, purple, yellow, green) firework is centrally located, radiating bright rays of light. Another prominent firework, mostly red and orange, is visible to the upper right. Diffused, soft bokeh lights from a distant city skyline in warm and cool tones (yellow, orange, teal, red) create a dreamy backdrop below the fireworks, shimmering through the rain-streaked glass.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic, with the bright, glowing fireworks providing the primary light source, illuminating the rain droplets and creating subtle reflections and refractions within them. The overall atmosphere is magical, reflective, and slightly melancholic, capturing the beauty of a celebration viewed through the isolating yet artistic filter of falling rain.\n\n**Key visual elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Fireworks viewed through a rainy window.\n*   **Foreground:** Numerous rain droplets on glass, varying in size, with hyperrealistic detail and reflections. Rain streaks.\n*   **Midground:** Multiple fireworks bursts (colorful central explosion, red/orange explosion).\n*   **Background:** Out-of-focus city lights (bokeh), dark night sky.\n\n**Style:** Hyperrealistic, photographic, dreamy, atmospheric.\n\n**Composition:** Vertical orientation, rule of thirds applied loosely with central firework as a focal point. Strong depth of field with sharp foreground droplets and blurred background.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant cool blues and purples in the sky, contrasted by warm and bright reds, oranges, yellows, greens from fireworks and city lights. Reflected colors within droplets.\n\n**Lighting:** Artificial light from fireworks, strong glow, reflections and refractions through water. Low ambient light otherwise.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Magical, celebratory, tranquil, intimate, contemplative.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refinement:\n\nRaindrops **streak and converge** on glass. Fireworks **flicker and swell**, their light **dancing** within water reflections. Distant city lights **pulse and dim**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Raindrops explosively splatter, merging violently as fireworks ignite with blinding, pulsating intensity. Water droplets shimmer chaotically, reflecting distorted, streaking light. Distant city lights flare and warp, creating a dizzying, volatile panorama of urban energy. The entire scene is alive with frantic, unpredictable movement.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Raindrops defying gravity, ascending a glass, splitting into iridescent nebulae, each trapping inverted fireworks that bloom in reverse. City lights morph into pulsating ocular forms, their reflections in the drops becoming a hyper-dimensional kaleidoscope. Time ripples, causing sparks to dance backward into pure light, and the very glass to breathe, distorting existence.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Rain-streaked glass, each droplet a lens-like prism reflecting the dazzling fireworks. A dramatic, slow zoom into a single droplet reveals a miniature, inverted city scape, pulsing with ethereal light. The camera then smoothly glides across the pane, revealing more intricate, shimmering reflections within each water bead, culminating in a sudden, explosive burst of vibrant color from the largest firework, momentarily blinding the view as the rain intensifies.",
