  "image_prompt": "Anime-style digital painting: Young person with short dark hair, light shirt, and black backpack descends a concrete and black metal staircase. View from behind, looking down onto a sprawling, dense city with buildings in white, grey, and light blue, and overhead power lines. Rolling green/blue hills in the far background under a clear light blue sky. Dynamic, immersive perspective with strong black outlines and sketch-like quality, evoking animation or comic art.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A person's body and legs move downwards, descending steps. Their head subtly shifts, gaze tracking the diminishing cityscape below. Buildings scroll past the descending figure, their forms dynamically altering perspective. Power lines gently sway. Distant hills continuously reframe and reposition as the viewpoint lowers."
