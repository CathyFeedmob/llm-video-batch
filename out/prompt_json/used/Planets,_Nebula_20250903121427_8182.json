  "video_prompt": "Celestial spheres drift and rotate through nebulae, subtly revealing surface changes. A shimmering, S-shaped stream of stardust flows dynamically, its particles sparkling and shifting. Distant points of light flare and fade. The cosmic background transitions subtly in color and luminous intensity.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a detailed, vertical image of an otherworldly cosmic scene. The dominant feature is a vibrant, S-shaped stream of golden, shimmering light, like stardust or a stellar river, flowing from upper to lower center, bright with sparkling points. The deep dark blue background transitions to purple, with wisps of purple and blue nebula and scattered bright stars, some with cross-shaped flares. Numerous spherical celestial bodies of varying sizes and luminosity populate the scene. Many are deep blue or indigo; larger ones in the foreground are lighter blue or brownish with faint patterns, some showing tiny orange or yellow lights. The composition is dynamic, with spheres filling the entire frame, creating a sense of vastness and infinite expansion, with depth from the glowing stream and subtle illumination. The overall impression should be one of wonder and grandeur in a fantastical, star-studded cosmos.",

A shimmering stream of stardust flows dynamically, its particles sparkling and shifting. Distant points of light pulse, flaring and fading. The cosmic background fluidly transitions in color and luminous intensity."
