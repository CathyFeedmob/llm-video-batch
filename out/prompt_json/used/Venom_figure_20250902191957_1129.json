  "video_prompt": "A highly glossy Venom action figure subtly shifts its menacing posture, its sharp, toothed grin twitching as its long tongue flickers. Intense red and cool blue lights dynamically sweep and pulsate across its reflective form, causing its large eyes to glow and subtly narrow. The desk surface beneath reflects these shifting, vibrant lights. In the blurred background, the digital art on the monitor subtly animates, a new line being drawn on the sketch of Venom's face, mirroring the figure's subtle movements and the electrifying light changes.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt for an image generation model:\n\n\"Dynamic, dramatically lit scene of a menacing Venom action figure. The glossy black figure, with its white spider emblem, wide toothy grin, long tongue, and large white eyes, is bathed in vibrant red and cool blue/cyan rim lighting, creating electrifying, neon highlights and reflections on its surface and the light-colored desk below. A shallow depth of field blurs a digital artist's workstation in the background, featuring a large monitor displaying digital art software with character sketches (including a Venom face reference) and a rainbow color palette. A sleek black monitor light bar, partial Marvel/Venom packaging, white keyboard, and black mouse are subtly visible, all in sharp focus on the action figure.\"",
