    "video_prompt": "A charming chef hedgehog busily prepares food in a warm kitchen. It meticulously picks at a green food bundle, its focused, gentle smile subtly shifting as its expressive eyes dart between ingredients. Its tiny hands carefully manipulate items on the cutting board, scattering small green flecks. Outside the window, foliage gently sways, causing natural light to softly change within the room. Blurred decorative lights in the foreground twinkle, enhancing the cozy, animated kitchen atmosphere.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, whimsical 3D illustration of an adorable hedgehog chef, wearing a crisp white chef's hat, a pink strawberry apron, and a delicate pink bow. It stands in a brightly lit, cozy kitchen at a wooden counter, meticulously preparing green, leaf-wrapped food bundles (like tamales or sushi rolls). The hedgehog delicately tastes a bundle on a cutting board, with scattered green bits. Additional bundles rest on a white serving dish, and a subtle bokeh effect blurs the immediate foreground. The background features a sunlit window with lush outdoor foliage, a modern metallic light fixture, and open shelves adorned with kitchenware and a pink macaron. Warm, inviting lighting throughout."
