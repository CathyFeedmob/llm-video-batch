  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Surreal high-angle full shot of a watermelon landscape. Hands hold a watermelon slice above, from which water pours onto a large half-watermelon below. Both watermelons feature miniature figures and trees, creating intricate scenes. Bright, even lighting with a soft, out-of-focus gray background.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Hands initiate a tilt, causing water to pour from one watermelon slice into another, forming a continuous stream. Ripples dynamically spread across the receiving surface, while droplets cascade and splash. Tiny figures actively navigate the shifting water levels and altering pathways, as the entire miniature landscape continually reconfigures and transforms around them."
