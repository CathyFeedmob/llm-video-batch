    "video_prompt": "The dandelion seeds gently float upwards and drift across the screen. The wolf's ears slightly twitch. The childâ€™s scarf subtly billows. The glow from the wand flickers and pulsates softly. A subtle breeze rustles the dandelions and grass.",
    "image_prompt": "An anime-style illustration of a boy wearing a blue wizard hat and a red scarf, lying in a lush green field filled with yellow dandelions, with a gray wolf wearing a red scarf sitting beside him, in a magical forest setting. The boy holds a glowing magic wand, and dandelion seeds float in the air. The scene is illuminated by the glowing wand and natural sunlight filtering through the trees. The atmosphere is peaceful and magical, with vibrant colors and soft lighting. Focus on the expressions of wonder on the boy and the wolf. There is a prominent cluster of white dandelion seeds in the middle left.  \"c29\" in the bottom right corner in white.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Dandelion seeds gently ascend and drift. Wolf's ears subtly twitch. Child's scarf softly billows. Wand's glow flickers and pulsates. Breeze rustles dandelions and grass.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Dandelion seeds explode upwards, swirling violently. The wolf's ears snap erect, head jerking sharply. The child's scarf whips aggressively around, thrashing in an unseen gale. The wand's glow blasts outwards, pulsing erratically with intense flashes. Dandelions and grass violently convulse, swaying wildly as if caught in a sudden, powerful vortex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The wolf's ears stretch and morph into dandelion petals, detaching to join the gravity-defying seeds that shimmer and phase through the tree branches. The child's scarf whips into a serpentine form, constricting the wand's glow, which pulsates backward, drawing the floating seeds into an impossible funnel. The dandelions writhe, their petals twisting into living fingers that stretch and pull the grass, causing it to ripple and flow like liquid, absorbing the light into shimmering patterns.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide sweep over the dandelion field, revealing the child and wolf. The camera quickly zooms to the child's hand, where the wand's light dramatically intensifies, sending a burst of dandelion seeds upwards. The wolf's head dramatically turns, ears twitching sharply as seeds swirl around its face. A gust of wind causes the child's scarf to whip rapidly, and the dandelions and grass vigorously sway, revealing new blossoms.",
