    "video_prompt": "The street lanterns and hanging lamps subtly flicker, their light reflecting on the wet ground. Raindrops continue to fall, creating ripples in the puddles. The large yellow umbrella held by the woman gently sways. Her hair slightly moves with an imperceptible breath. The silhouetted figures in the background show subtle variations in their standing positions, as if shifting weight. A very slow, almost unnoticeable zoom in on the overall scene.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt for generating an image similar to the provided one, focusing on key visual elements:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Full Detailed Prompt:**\nA stunning, high-definition, anime-style illustration of a bustling, traditional Japanese street at night, drenched in a soft, atmospheric rain. The primary focus is a young woman, seen from the waist up in a medium shot, standing on the right side of the frame. She has short, dark bob-cut hair, wears a grey or light blue kimono with a black skirt (hakama), and holds a large open umbrella, colored a vibrant yellow-orange underneath and light blue on the top with visible raindrops. She has bright, glowing yellow-orange eyes and a calm, slightly melancholic expression.\n\nThe street is narrow and lined with dark, traditional wooden buildings featuring overhanging roofs and ornate, warm glowing lanterns suspended from posts and attached to the walls. Several paper lanterns with intricate designs hang vertically on a tall pole on the left, casting a strong yellow glow. The ground is wet and reflective, with visible puddles and ripples from the falling rain, mirroring the warm light from the lanterns and creating vertical streaks of light.\n\nIn the blurred background, other silhouetted figures with umbrellas walk away, adding depth and a sense of movement. The overall color palette is dominated by dark teals and blues for the night sky and distant buildings, contrasted sharply with the warm oranges and yellows of the lanterns and the woman's umbrella. The lighting is soft and ambient, with clear sources from the lanterns illuminating the rain and reflections. The atmosphere is serene and contemplative despite the rain, reminiscent of a Ghibli movie's attention to detail and mood.\n\n**Concise Prompt:**\nAnime illustration: A young woman in a grey kimono with an open orange-yellow and light blue umbrella, standing on a rainy, reflective traditional Japanese street at night. Wet ground, scattered puddles and ripples from rain. Bright, warm glowing traditional lanterns illuminate the scene. Silhouetted figures with umbrellas in blurred background. Dark teal and blue tones with warm orange and yellow accents. Atmospheric, serene, Ghibli-inspired. High detail, sharp focus on the woman, ambient lighting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Flickering streetlights and lamps, reflecting on rippling puddles from continuous raindrops. A yellow umbrella subtly sways. Hair gently moves with imperceptible breath. Silhouetted figures shift their weight. Very slow, almost unnoticeable zoom in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Street lanterns EXPLODE into dazzling light, casting chaotic, swirling reflections! Rain transforms into a VIOLENT torrent, violently ripping through puddles and propelling the yellow umbrella into a wild, airborne dance! The woman's hair whips and snaps as she is SUDDENLY jolted! Silhouetted figures in the background become grotesque, lunging, contorting forms! The entire scene rapidly ZOOMS and SPINS with disorienting force!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The street lanterns and hanging lamps subtly flicker, their light reflecting on the wet ground. Raindrops continue to fall, creating ripples in the puddles. The large yellow umbrella held by the woman gently sways. Her hair slightly moves with an imperceptible breath. The silhouetted figures in the background show subtle variations in their standing positions, as if shifting weight. A very slow, almost unnoticeable zoom in on the overall scene.\n\nThe raindrops reverse course, floating upwards and coalescing into shimmering spheres before vanishing. The umbrella becomes a giant ephemeral lily, its petals pulsating. The silhouetted figures dissolve into swirling light, then reconstitute as abstract geometric forms that dance impossibly. The wet ground becomes liquid quicksilver, reflecting inverted reflections of buildings and figures.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The street lanterns and hanging lamps subtly flicker, their light reflecting on the wet ground as the \ncamera slowly tracks forward, revealing the woman and her large yellow umbrella. Raindrops continue to fall, creating ripples in the puddles. The large yellow umbrella held by the woman gently sways as a gust of wind causes her hair to abruptly flutter. The silhouetted figures in the background subtly shift, their umbrellas momentarily dipping with the wind. A very slow, almost unnoticeable zoom in on the overall scene intensifies the quiet drama.",
