    "video_prompt": "Subtle flickering of the light source within the central pyramid structure, with fine particles gently flowing upwards from its apex. The digital numbers in the background slowly shift and fade. The glowing rings around the central elements subtly pulse. A slight camera zoom out and rotation reveals more subtle details.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, futuristic digital art piece depicting a complex data processing system. Dominant colors are cool blues, whites, and touches of metallic silver and gold.\n\n**Elements:**\n*   **Central Structure:** A large, multi-layered structure in the center. The top layer is a metallic silver cube with circular indentations on its sides, from which many thin, flexible wires with spherical silver tips extend upwards and outward like fiber optics.\n*   **Mid-layers:** Below the cube, there's a clear, cylindrical ring, with glowing blue and white circular patterns within, suggesting data flow or energy. Beneath this, a large, glowing, translucent blue-white square plane, acting as a base for the cube and cylinder.\n*   **Base Structure:** The lowest part of the central structure is a large, translucent, faceted pyramid or multi-sided prism, glowing brightly with blue and white light, resting on the ground plane.\n*   **Ground Plane:** The ground is a dark, reflective surface with intricate glowing white and blue circular patterns emanating from the center, resembling a complex circuit board or data network. A beam of light emanates from the base structure, extending towards the viewer.\n*   **Background:** A dark, digital background filled with glowing blue-white numerical data (binary code, numbers like 1, 2, 8, 9, etc.) floating and falling, creating a matrix-like effect.\n*   **Peripheral Elements:** On the left and right sides, slightly blurred, are glowing blue-white rectangular panels or screens with patterns of light, suggesting more data or interfaces.\n*   **Lighting:** Strong, ethereal glowing light emanating from the central structures (cube's base, square plane, pyramid), casting reflections on the ground. Ambient light from the data in the background.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Sci-fi, technological, abstract, ethereal, clean, high-tech.\n*   **Text Overlay:** In the bottom right corner, a prominent, golden, three-dimensional text with a white top surface reads \"c29\", with a soft reflection on the ground.\n\n**Style:** Digital art, 3D rendering, cyberpunk, futuristic, abstract, geometric, intricate. Focus on translucency, glowing effects, and precise lines.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The central pyramid's light source subtly flickers, emitting fine particles that gently ascend. Digital numbers in the background slowly shift and fade. Glowing rings around central elements subtly pulse. The camera smoothly zooms out and rotates, revealing a wider perspective.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Central pyramid explodes, spewing crystalline shards and fiery dust. Ascending particles ignite into blinding flares as digital backdrop morphs into torrential data streams. Rings around elements rupture, releasing shocking energy waves that ripple outwards, distorting the scene. A violent, rapid camera plunge into the maelstrom intensifies the overwhelming chaos. Explosive, unpredictable transformations dominate the frame.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The central pyramid structure reverses gravity, drawing luminous spectral particles *downwards* from its base, *into* the apex. Digital numbers in the background *liquify* into streams of negative light, *sinking* into the floor. Glowing rings around the elements *implode*, forming miniature black holes that *reflect* impossible colors. The camera *spirals through* these miniature black holes, revealing a canvas where time flows *backward and forward simultaneously*, objects are *neither here nor there*, and reality is a *melting kaleidoscope* of impossible forms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow zoom into the central pyramid, revealing the subtle light source flickering with increasing intensity. Luminescent particles erupt from the apex, swirling and accelerating upwards as the digital numbers in the background rapidly shift and distort. The glowing rings pulse erratically, their light casting dramatic shadows that sweep across the scene. A subtle camera roll enhances the unsettling atmosphere.",
