    "video_prompt": "A subtle rise and fall of the chest indicating breathing. Hair gently sways as if from a faint breeze. Tears slowly trace lines down her cheek, glittering softly. Eyes blink slowly and occasionally shift gaze. The bokeh lights in the background subtly shimmer and change intensity. The ring on her finger reflects glints of shifting light. The cans on the ground imperceptibly shift or subtly roll with a faint metallic glint.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down into categories for clarity and effectiveness:\n\n**Overall Style & Mood:**\nAnime illustration, painterly, highly detailed, realistic texture rendering, melancholic, somber, emotional, high contrast, dramatic lighting.\n\n**Subject & Pose:**\nA young woman (mid-20s, delicate features, long flowing brown hair) lying on her side, head resting on her left arm, looking directly at the viewer with a sorrowful expression. Her right hand is visible, resting near her face, ring on her fourth finger. Her body is angled slightly away, revealing shoulders and upper chest. Visible scratch marks/wounds on her upper arm and shoulder. Tears are visible on her cheeks and in her eyes.\n\n**Facial Features & Expression:**\nLarge, expressive, dark brown eyes with prominent eyelashes (appears to be wearing eyeliner/mascara). Glossy, slightly parted lips with a natural pink/red color. Subtle blush on cheeks, tear tracks visible. Slight redness around the eyes from crying. Ear visible with multiple piercings.\n\n**Clothing & Accessories:**\nSimple black spaghetti strap top/dress. Silver ring on her fourth finger (appears to be a wedding or engagement ring). Multiple silver ear piercings (hoop, stud, helix).\n\n**Environment & Background:**\nIndoors, nighttime setting. Ground appears to be a rough, dark surface (possibly concrete or asphalt). Multiple discarded aluminum beverage cans (red \"Budweiser\" cans and green cans) are scattered around her, some upright, some on their sides. Distant background is blurred, showing soft, out-of-focus bokeh lights (yellow/orange and hints of green), suggesting city lights at night or interior lights.\n\n**Lighting:**\nSoft, somewhat diffused ambient light illuminating the subject, creating realistic shadows and highlights that emphasize her features and form. Stronger, almost spotlight-like illumination on her face, highlighting the tears and the emotional expression. Rim lighting on her hair, separating her from the dark background. Subtle reflections on the cans.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant muted tones: warm skin tones (peaches, light browns), rich brown hair, deep black clothing, dark background. Pops of color from the red and green beverage cans. Subtle use of reds and pinks in makeup and tear-stained areas. Bokeh lights in soft yellows, oranges, and greens.\n\n**Composition:**\nClose-up portrait with the subject occupying the majority of the frame. Angled shot creates depth and intimacy. Rule of thirds applied, with her eyes and face positioned for maximum emotional impact. Foreground elements (cans) are slightly blurred to suggest depth of field. Vignette effect subtly darkens the corners, drawing focus to the subject.\n\n**Atmosphere/Emotional Tone (keywords):**\nDespair, vulnerability, sadness, loneliness, abandonment, heartbreak, drinking, self-harm, emotional distress.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Chest gently rises and falls. Hair sways as if from a faint breeze. Tears slowly trace lines down her cheek, softly glittering. Eyes blink slowly and occasionally shift gaze. Background bokeh lights subtly shimmer and change intensity. The ring on her finger reflects shifting light glints. Cans on the ground imperceptibly shift or subtly roll with faint metallic glints.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Hair violently whips and snarls around her face, tangling. Tears gush down her cheeks, streaking like acid. Her chest heaves erratically, convulsing. Eyes snap open, wide and staring, then rapidly dart. The bokeh lights explode outwards, flaring blindingly. The ring transforms, melting then hardening into a sharp spike. Cans launch and spin wildly, clashing with deafening metallic crashes as they dent and crumple. Every element bursts with chaotic, unpredictable energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The tears defy gravity, tracing upward, then solidify into shimmering crystals. Strands of hair morph into ethereal tendrils, coiling and uncoiling like smoke. The ring expands, encasing her hand in pure light, while cans liquify into iridescent puddles, then reform as luminous butterflies fluttering erratically. Her eyes become swirling galaxies, and the background lights bloom into dancing auroras, all moving in a dreamlike, impossible ballet.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Whispers of the night, a silent scream. Slow, sorrowful zoom on her tear-streaked face as her chest gently falls, a fragile breath. The ring on her finger glints, a beacon of forgotten promises. A sudden, subtle shake of the ground, empty cans shimmer and roll closer, their metallic clinks amplifying the stark silence. Her eyes, filled with deep pain, slowly close, then spring open, scanning the blurry city lights as if searching for an escape. Light flickers, casting dancing shadows across her vulnerable form. The scene ends, a tableau of quiet despair.",
