  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Cartoon snow leopard playing a mandolin in a vibrant outdoor scene. The snow leopard has shrewd yellow eyes, a smirk, a black circular emblem with an 'X' on its chest, and a colorful patterned belt. It stands in a field of flowers with rolling green hills and snow-capped mountains in the background under a blue sky with fluffy clouds. Whimsical, musical, serene.",
