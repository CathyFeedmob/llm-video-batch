    "video_prompt": "A metallic warrior queen subtly shifts, light dynamically reflecting across her chrome skin and intricate, segmented armor as it flexes. Her long, dark hair gently sways, catching crystalline highlights. Her intense gaze subtly deepens, lips parting with a controlled breath. Intricate facial patterns briefly shimmer. Behind her, the halo-like concentric rings of the background slowly rotate, their geometric and textured patterns subtly pulsing and changing, creating a sense of ancient power in motion.",
    "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed but Concise):**\n\"A regal, stylized metallic warrior queen, waist-up, with a direct intense gaze. Her chrome-like skin gleams polished silver with warm bronze/copper shadows. Features piercing dark eyes, metallic lips, and intricate geometric tribal patterns etched on her face. She wears an elaborate metallic crown with a central emblem, a high segmented metallic collar, and form-fitting, highly detailed polished silver/chrome armor with layered shoulders and a sculpted chest, intricately engraved with patterns resembling ancient scripts and circuitry. Her long black hair flows with crystalline highlights. The background is a circular halo motif of concentric rings in black, white, silver, and gold, featuring radiating lines, textured dots, and geometric patterns, blending ancient Egyptian/Aztec with futuristic and art deco aesthetics. Luminous, striking, powerful, mystical digital artwork.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\"Stylized metallic warrior queen, waist-up, intense gaze.
