    "video_prompt": "The robotic shrimp slightly sways side to side, as if gently floating. The long, thin red antennae subtly undulate and twitch. Tiny electrical sparks intermittently flicker around the exposed joints and mechanisms of its segmented body. The \"c29\" text gently bobs and subtly scales up and down. A soft, reflected glint of light slowly traverses across its polished red and white carapace.",
    "image_prompt": "A sleek, futuristic robotic shrimp, predominantly white and red, inspired by a prawn. The body segments are distinct, with exposed metallic joints and intricate internal wiring visible. The design features sharp, angular lines combined with smooth, curved surfaces, giving it a modern, almost industrial aesthetic. It has multiple articulated legs with claw-like ends, and long, thin antennae extending upwards and backwards. The shrimp is positioned in a dynamic, slightly upward-curving pose as if in motion. The lighting is dramatic, with highlights catching the reflective surfaces of the robot and creating a sense of depth. The background is a soft, dark blue-grey gradient, enhancing the contrast with the vibrant red and white of the robot. In the bottom right corner, a stylized, glossy white \"C29\" is present, possibly a model number or branding. The overall atmosphere is clean, sci-fi, and highly detailed.\n\n**Art Style:** Sci-fi, robotic, detailed rendering, industrial design, realistic yet stylized.\n**Colors:** Dominant red and white for the robot, dark blue-grey for the background. Silver/chrome for metallic parts, subtle orange/yellow for internal wiring.\n**Lighting:** Studio lighting, strong highlights on glossy surfaces, soft shadows. Directional light emphasizing depth and texture.\n**Composition:** Rule of thirds, dynamic pose, leading lines from antennae, strong diagonal elements.\n**Atmosphere:** Modern, futuristic, high-tech, precise.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The robotic shrimp violently thrashes, its segmented body twisting with explosive force as its antennae snap erratically. Jagged electrical arcs erupt from its joints, illuminating a frenzied flailing of limbs. The \"c29\" text shatters and reassembles with each aggressive twitch, while the polished carapace flares with intense, strobing reflections.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robotic shrimp's segments ripple like liquid, dissolving and reforming from swirling data streams, defying its solid structure. Its antennae stretch infinitely, becoming constellations of light before snapping back. Electrical sparks form intricate fractal patterns, briefly pulling reality into geometric distortions. The \"c29\" text shimmers, phases through solid surfaces, and momentarily becomes miniature black holes absorbing light, then re-emerges glowing, causing the shrimp's reflection to appear on a non-existent surface.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic slow-motion pan initiates from the floor, ascending the robotic shrimp's sleek \"c29\" tail, emphasizing its articulated segments. The camera tightly tracks, revealing intricate gears and whirring mechanisms as it climbs the carapace, culminating in a dramatic pull-back to a wide shot. The shrimp then unexpectedly lunges forward, a vibrant trail of electrical sparks erupting from its joints, before freezing mid-air. The sparks shimmer, leaving an ethereal afterglow.",
