    "video_prompt": "A child, viewed from behind, raises a giant sparkler high above their head, looking up in wonder. The sparkler ignites, bursting with intense white and yellow light that dynamically illuminates the child and immediate surroundings with a warm, pulsing glow. From the sparkler, colorful, smoke-like tendrils billow and swirl rapidly upwards and outwards, transforming the night sky. Fiery oranges and reds dynamically transition into purples, blues, and greens, creating a vast, evolving cosmic nebula. The full moon subtly glows and pulsates with a soft yellow-orange light against the shifting, star-filled backdrop.",
    "image_prompt": "A child viewed from behind, with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a dark red long-sleeved top and pleated skirt, stands on a rugged stone path at night, looking up in wonder. They hold a giant sparkler high, emitting brilliant white and yellow light that illuminates them and the path. From the sparkler, a spectacular, swirling rainbow-like nebula erupts into the deep indigo night sky. Fiery oranges, reds, and yellows transition into vibrant purples, pinks, cool blues, teals, and greens, filling the expanse with cosmic flames and smoke-like tendrils. Countless tiny white stars speckle the dark sky. A large, warm yellow-orange full moon, with distinct craters and a soft halo, glows in the upper right. The uneven stone path is lined with dry, golden grass and sparse bushes. Wooden poles with wires and dark green trees rise on both sides, leading to distant, hazy blue-purple mountains under a soft horizon glow. The scene evokes childlike wonder and a magical cosmic dreamscape, rendered in a painterly style with vibrant colors and rich textures."
