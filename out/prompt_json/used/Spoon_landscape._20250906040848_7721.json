  "image_prompt": "A surreal miniature landscape pouring from a white spoon into a ceramic bowl. The spoon spills a scene of teal mountains, green trees, a waterfall, and an East Asian building into a larger bowl containing an island with buildings, pink flowers, goldfish, and lily pads on dark blue-green water. Softly blurred background, serene atmosphere.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A hand pours, and a miniature world dynamically emerges from the spoon. Smoke billows and drifts as a mountain and waterfall scene unfurls into the ceramic bowl. Within the expanding landscape, water shimmers and ripples, while tiny fish actively swim. Intricate floral elements and East Asian structures gradually materialize and come into view, transforming the bowl into a vibrant, evolving scene."
