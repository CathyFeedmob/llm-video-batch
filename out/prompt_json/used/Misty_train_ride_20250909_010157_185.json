    "video_prompt": "A young girl with long, black hair, wearing a white shirt and black skirt, sits on a train seat. Her hair subtly sways with the movement of the train, and individual strands gently flutter as if from a light breeze. The rain streaks down the windows, some droplets sliding slowly, while others quickly descend. The water pooled on the train seats and floor shimmers faintly with minor refractions of light. The girl's chest rises and falls ever so slightly, indicating breathing. Her gaze remains fixed, but a subtle blink could occur. Small water droplets occasionally drip from the ceiling or window frames onto the train's interior surfaces, causing tiny ripples or splashes upon impact. The train itself has a subtle, almost imperceptible sway back and forth, reflecting its movement along the tracks.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating this image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a sad or melancholic young Asian woman with long, flowing black hair, wearing a white short-sleeved button-up shirt with a red bow tie and a dark pleated skirt, sitting on a train seat. The interior of the train is dark and metallic, with water droplets or condensation visible everywhere, emphasizing a rainy atmosphere. She holds her right hand to her chest, delicately touching her shirt. Rain streaks down the train windows, revealing a blurred, moody landscape outside with mountains, a large body of water, and distant lights. The sky is overcast and grey with hints of distant blue. The lighting is dim and diffused, with reflections of light on the wet surfaces. The overall color palette is cool and muted, dominated by dark blues, greys, and muted greens, with touches of white and black. The scene conveys a sense of melancholy and tranquility. The art style is anime-inspired with painterly textures, reminiscent of digital painting, evoking a slightly dreamlike or nostalgic feel. Strong visual emphasis on rain and wet surfaces throughout the image.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Young Asian woman, sad/melancholic expression, long flowing black hair.\n*   **Attire:** White short-sleeved button-up shirt, red bow tie, dark pleated skirt.\n*   **Body Language:** Sitting, right hand to chest, delicately touching shirt.\n*   **Setting:** Inside a train car, dark, metallic, wet surfaces (rain/condensation).\n*   **Background (seen through windows):** Blurred rainy landscape, mountains, large body of water, distant lights.\n*   **Sky:** Overcast, grey, hints of distant blue.\n*   **Weather/Atmosphere:** Heavy rain, wet surfaces, melancholic, tranquil.\n*   **Lighting:** Dim, diffused, reflections on wet surfaces.\n*   **Color Palette:** Cool and muted (dark blues, greys, muted greens, white, black).\n*   **Art Style:** Anime-inspired, painterly textures, digital painting, dreamlike/nostalgic.\n*   **Composition:** Full body shot, emphasizing the subject and the rainy environment.\n*   **Visual Cues:** Rain streaks on windows, water droplets on surfaces.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Hair sways subtly, individual strands fluttering. Rain streaks down windows, droplets sliding and descending. Pooled water shimmers faintly with light refractions. Chest rises and falls minimally. A blink might occur. Droplets drip, causing tiny ripples or splashes. Train sways imperceptibly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The train violently lurches, hurtling forward as rain blasts against the windows. Water streams from cracks, rapidly filling the rattling carriage. The girl's hair whips around her, eyes wide, as a strong gust of wind rips through, scattering droplets like shrapnel. Her body is thrown against the seat, then jolts upright, hair thrashing, as the train careens, threatening to derail. Exterior mountains blur into streaking lines, reflecting the chaotic speed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The train phases in and out of existence, with raindrops flowing upwards and forming crystalline structures on the windows before evaporating into starlight. The girl's hair undulates like bioluminescent kelp, reaching for the inverted sky. Her breath exhales iridescent butterflies that become part of the train's shimmering, liquid-metal walls. The seats melt and reform as soundwaves, echoing forgotten melodies, while the outside landscape distorts into an endless, kaleidoscopic spiral of impossible light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Mid-Shot:** Rain-streaked window, subtle train sway. **Tracking:** Follow a single droplet tracing the glass. **Close-up:** Girl's hand, subtly adjusting her collar, then her eyes. **Extreme Close-up:** A single tear, reflecting the blurred outside, slowly falls. **Pan:** Across the water-drenched seat to glistening floor, hinting at a larger storm. **Zoom-out:** Reveals the desolate landscape, emphasizing her isolation.",
