    "video_prompt": "The girl's pink hair gently sways with the subtle motion of the bus, a few delicate strands falling across her shoulders. Her chest rises and falls barely perceptibly, as if breathing. Sunlight filtering through the bus window flickers softly on her face and the arm embracing her bag, creating dancing light and shadow patterns. Occasional shimmering light reflections appear on the bus window and interior surfaces, mimicking passing light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the given image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA peaceful, watercolor-style illustration of a young anime girl with long, flowing pink hair and vibrant green eyes. She is wearing a white short-sleeved collared shirt and a dark skirt, appearing to be a school uniform. She is seated inside a bus, visible from the waist up through one of its windows. Her head is tilted slightly forward, resting against a brown school bag that she is hugging with both arms.\n\nThe composition captures her from a slight low angle, looking out from the bus window. Sunlight streams in from the outside, creating dappled shadows and highlights on her hair, face, and arms, suggesting a warm, summer day. The background outside the bus window shows lush green trees and foliage, with bright sunlight filtering through the leaves, indicating a journey through a scenic, possibly rural, area.\n\nThe overall color palette is soft and bright, dominated by greens from the outdoor scenery, warm browns on the bag, and delicate pinks for her hair. The illustration has a hand-painted, slightly textured watercolor aesthetic, with visible brushstrokes and soft, diffused edges, reminiscent of an impressionistic art style. The bus interior is depicted with dark, muted tones, and visible yellow grab handles and horizontal bars are dimly lit in the upper part of the image, contrasting with the bright exterior. The lower part of the image shows the bus floor or body, with dynamic light reflections and artistic splatters of white and blue, enhancing the watercolor effect. The atmosphere is serene and contemplative.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize for generation:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Anime girl, pink hair, green eyes, school uniform, hugging bag.\n*   **Setting:** Inside a bus, looking out a window.\n*   **Light/Shadow:** Dappled sunlight, bright highlights, soft shadows, warm overall lighting.\n*   **Style:** Watercolor illustration, soft edges, visible brushstrokes, impressionistic.\n*   **Composition:** Low angle, subject framed by bus window, focus on girl and outdoor scenery.\n*   **Colors:** Dominant greens, pink, white, warm browns, muted dark blues/greys for bus interior.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Peaceful, contemplative, summery.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Pink hair sways subtly with bus motion; delicate strands fall. Chest rises and falls barely perceptibly. Sunlight flickers on face and arm, creating dancing light and shadow patterns. Occasional shimmering light reflections appear on window and interior surfaces.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The girl's pink hair violently whips as the bus lurches and slams. Sunlight streams, then vanishes, then bursts through the window, contorting her face with fractured light. Her arm convulses, crushing her bag as the bus interior contorts, metal groaning and warping. Reflections explode from the glass, shattering into myriad forms, mimicking an unseen, chaotic force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The girl's pink hair, defying gravity, drifts upwards, then flows like liquid across her eyes, revealing a swirling galaxy within. Her breath causes the bus ceiling to ripple, revealing trees outside that grow inwards, their leaves morphing into tiny, chiming bells. Sunlight bends around her, creating kaleidoscopic patterns that coalesce into floating, glass-like entities, then melt back into the bus window, which itself begins to twist like taffy. Her embracing arm elongates and twines impossibly around her bag, which now shimmers with the light of a distant, impossibly large star.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The bus lurches. A cinematic slow zoom in on the girl's face, pink hair softly swaying. Sunlight streaks the window, reflecting on her half-closed eyes, then glinting off the worn leather of her hugged bag. Her hand subtly tightens, nails almost digging in, revealing an inner turmoil as dappled shadows dance across the frame, a ghostly ballet of light.",
