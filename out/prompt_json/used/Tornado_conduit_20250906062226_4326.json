  "video_prompt": "A colossal dark red and purple vortex descends rapidly, spewing jagged blue and white lightning. Concentric rings of shimmering reddish-orange and neon green particles radiate outwards from its impact point. Small, sparkling white specks streak across the turbulent, dark background. The scene pulses with an intense, warm glow emanating from the vortex's base.",
  "image_prompt": "A powerful, otherworldly tempest or cosmic phenomenon, in dark, dramatic tones with glowing elements. A massive, swirling, dark red and purple cloud at the top unleashes bright, jagged streaks of purplish-blue and white lightning, especially concentrated in its central, funnel-like structure. This core descends like a gnarled, twisting vortex of dense energy, electricity coursing through it, plunging into a dark expanse. Concentric rings of light radiate from its base: inner shimmering reddish-orange, then a wider, brilliant neon green, followed by fainter reddish rings. A strong warm glow emanates from the vortex's bottom where it meets the surface. Small, sparkling white specks are scattered throughout. Subtle golden metallic \"c29\" in the bottom right corner. Vertical image, dynamic composition, vibrant colors, immense power, mystery, and cosmic scale.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A colossal vortex rapidly descends, continuously spewing jagged lightning. Concentric rings of shimmering particles vigorously radiate outwards from its impact. Small, sparkling specks streak dynamically across the turbulent background, which subtly shifts. The entire scene pulses with an intense, warm glow, fluctuating and expanding from the vortex's base."
