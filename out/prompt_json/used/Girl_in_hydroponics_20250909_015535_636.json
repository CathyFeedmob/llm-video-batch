    "video_prompt": "Subtle sway of the girl's top, gentle hair movement, plants slightly rustling, soft flickering of the fluorescent lights, faint hum and shimmer from the monitor screens, a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "a young girl with long blonde hair, standing barefoot in a futuristic, vertical farm, looking directly at the camera. The farm consists of multiple rows of hydroponic plants, illuminated by bright fluorescent lights on the ceiling. There are various technological components, including screens with data, wires, and machinery integrated into the plant racks. The overall atmosphere is clean, somewhat sterile, and lit with a cool, greenish-blue hue. The girl is wearing a light grey t-shirt and matching shorts. Pipes and ventilation systems are visible overhead. The composition is a straight-on, full-body shot of the girl, centered, with the rows of plants and machinery receding into the background, creating a strong sense of depth and perspective. The style is hyperrealistic with a subtle sci-fi aesthetic. There is subtle text in the upper left corner and \"C29\" in the bottom right.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few options, focusing exclusively on dynamic elements:\n\n**Option 1 (Concise & Focused):**\nSoft sway of white t-shirt. Hair strands gently shift. Leaves quiver. Fluorescent lights subtly flicker. Monitors emit a faint shimmer. A slow, almost imperceptible dolly out.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Descriptive Movement):**\nThe girl's top subtly ripples. Her hair delicately sways. Plants exhibit a gentle tremble. Fluorescent lights softly pulse. Monitor screens display a low, shimmering hum. An incredibly gradual, near-imperceptible zoom out begins.\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasizing Subtlety):**\nTextile undulation from the girl's top. Hair responds to imperceptible air currents. Foliage vibrates softly. Fluorescent light output oscillates subtly. Monitors emit a low, undulating glow. The camera executes an extremely slow, nearly unnoticeable, outward movement.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Fluorescent lights shatter, showering sparks. Plants erupt, violently shaking their leaves, tearing through their beds. Monitors explode outwards with blinding flashes. The girl's form distorts, limbs stretching, hair whipping into a chaotic vortex. The entire corridor twists and contorts, metal shrieking as pipes burst and walls buckle. A catastrophic energy surge rips through, consuming the scene in a maelstrom of destruction, then abruptly snaps to darkness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Girl's top unravels into luminous vines, her hair blooms into a bioluminescent garden, each strand a delicate, time-warping tendril. Plants erupt from their beds, forming impossible crystalline structures that sing. Fluorescent lights pulse, drawing galaxies into existence, while monitors exhale shimmering, sentient fog that dances with reverse-gravity butterflies. The room itself twists and folds, dimensions collapsing as the 'C29' text floats away, becoming a constellation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, unsettling zoom-out reveals a pale girl in a sterile, futuristic hydroponic farm. Overhead lights softly flicker, casting long shadows. Her eyes, wide with a subtle anxiety, dart left then right, a barely perceptible tremor in her hand as she reaches out, then hesitates. The plants around her gently sway, powered by unseen currents, while digital displays glow with a faint, hypnotic hum, hinting at vital, unseen processes.",
