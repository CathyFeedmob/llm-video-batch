  "video_prompt": "A young woman, seen from behind, sits at a desk, deeply engrossed in thought as she gazes out a large arched window. Outside, a fantastical cityscape unfolds: a massive full moon slowly traverses the twilight sky, casting shifting light onto intricate, steampunk-inspired structures while clouds gently drift. Subtle twinkles appear among the dense, Gothic spires. Inside, a few loose papers softly float near the window. The woman occasionally shifts her head slightly, her posture conveying deep introspection, as desk lamps softly flicker, accentuating the scene's contemplative atmosphere.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, hitting the key visual and atmospheric elements:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVertical, painterly illustration: A young woman, seen from behind, with dark hair in a low ponytail, sits at a cluttered wooden desk, gazing intently out a large, dark-framed arched window. The desk features tall stacks of books, two vintage black desk lamps casting warm light, papers, and an open book, with a few sheets seemingly floating near the window frame.\n\nBeyond the window, a breathtaking, fantastical twilight cityscape unfolds: the left pane features a massive, luminous pale yellow-white full moon in a light blue to peachy-orange sky, with sprawling industrial steampunk towers and piping. The right pane displays darker, intricate Gothic spires and structures with overgrown elements under a bluer sky.\n\nThe dimly lit room's edges reveal overflowing bookshelves. The overall palette contrasts cool blues and grays of the city with warm orange and yellow glows from the moon and desk lamps. Dreamy, contemplative, melancholic, evoking introspection, wonder, and escape.",

Clouds gently drift, and subtle twinkles appear among spires. Inside, papers softly float near the window, and lamps softly flicker."
