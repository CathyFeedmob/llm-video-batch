    "video_prompt": "The child astronaut subtly drifts closer to the camera, their rabbit ears slightly swaying. Subtle sparks and shimmering light particles emerge and disappear around the glowing orbit, with a soft pulsating glow from the orbit itself. The distant stars delicately twinkle, and the moon's surface exhibits a very faint, almost imperceptible, shimmer.",
    "image_prompt": "A fantastical full-body portrait of a cute, mischievous chibi-style astronaut with cartoon-like rabbit ears on their helmet, floating dreamily in space against the backdrop of a large, ethereal moon. The astronaut is centered, surrounded by glowing sparkles and a bright, golden ring of light swirling around them, slightly blurred for a sense of motion. The moon is prominently visible in the upper two-thirds, showing subtle craters and a soft, pale cream hue. The lower third features the dark, star-dusted expanse of space with a faint, darker texture suggesting distant asteroids or debris. The overall color palette is cool with hints of warm golden glows, featuring blues, purples, and teals for the various glittering elements. The style is a blend of digital art and anime, with clean lines and soft shading, creating a joyful, whimsical, and awe-inspiring atmosphere, showcasing adventure and wonder. The lighting is soft and otherworldly, emanating from the glowing elements and subtly illuminating the astronaut and the moon. The image is rendered with exquisite detail and high resolution, evoking a sense of calm and cosmic beauty.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The child astronaut glides forward, rabbit ears swaying gently. Sparks and light particles appear and vanish around the subtly pulsating, glowing orbit. Distant stars actively twinkle, and the moon's surface exhibits a faint, rhythmic shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The child astronaut RIGIDLY jerks forward towards the camera, rabbit ears violently flapping! The glowing orbit EXPLODES into a chaotic storm of sparks and pulsating light, casting erratic shadows. Distant stars COLLAPSE inwards, then ERUPT into blinding supernovas. The moon's surface RIPPLES and CRACKS, revealing bubbling, molten core beneath. This isn't just movement: it's a cosmic FURY unleashed!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The child astronaut, ethereal and shimmering, slowly descends upward as gravity reverses, their rabbit ears elongating into celestial ribbons that unfurl across the cosmos. The glowing orbit distorts, rippling like liquid light, absorbing and re-emitting scattered stardust. Distant stars pulsate with inverse time, their light retracting into unborn nebulae, while the moon's surface, now a shimmering, crystalline entity, breathes\n with iridescent currents.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Opening slow tracking shot: rabbit-eared astronaut drifts from behind the Moon, eyes wide. Rapid dramatic zoom-in on their face as they spin. The child playfully tumbles forward, a luminous ring trailing, illuminating twinkling distant stars. Suddenly, a bright, pulsating shimmer explodes from the ring, scattering brilliant light across the lunar surface and fading into darkness as they vanish into the void.",
