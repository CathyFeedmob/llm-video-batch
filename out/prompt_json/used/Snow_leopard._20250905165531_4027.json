  "video_prompt": "Snow leopard cub playfully strums a small instrument, swaying slightly. Its head bobs with innocent wonder. The cub's focus shifts, and its ears twitch. The tail swishes subtly. Subtle changes in its expression convey amusement. Wind rustles the cub's fur and the surrounding wildflowers.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Anthropomorphic snow leopard cub, standing, playing a mandolin, facing right, head tilted down, wide luminous amber eyes, innocent wonder. White, black, and gray spotted fur, pink nose. Wearing a blue patterned scarf and brown and gold belt. Soft paws. Open grassy field with purple wildflowers, dirt path. Snow-capped mountains, clear blue sky with white clouds. Whimsical, cute, natural landscape. Full shot, close to viewer.",
