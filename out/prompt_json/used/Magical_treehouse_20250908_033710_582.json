    "video_prompt": "The fireflies gently pulse and drift through the jungle canopy. Water ripples subtly around the lily pads and colored stones, reflecting the light. The water pouring from the spout creates tiny, consistent splashes with subtle ringlets expanding. The light glowing within the bottles occasionally flickers and brightens.",
    "image_prompt": "An illustration in a whimsical, storybook style depicting a magical forest glade at night. The central focus is a bamboo and thatch hut, resembling a small house, centered on a massive Victoria amazonica (giant water lily) pad, floating on calm, dark water. The hut's roof is lush with verdant foliage and branches, with several glowing glass bottles, resembling firefly jars, arranged on it, and two more on the pad deck beside the hut entrance. The windows and door of the hut glow invitingly. Vines with leaves are wrapped around the bamboo columns supporting the roof.\n\nThe water reflects the light from the glowing bottles. Surrounding the central lily pad are several other very large, ruffled-edge lily pads, some also holding glowing bottles, and tiny white, fluffy rabbit-like creatures engaged in activities: one group fishing with small rods into the water, and another pair also fishing from a distant pad. One rabbit is fishing from a small raft. A small wooden ladder extends from the main lily pad into the water.\n\nThe water surface beneath and around the lily pads is covered with numerous smooth, colorful, reflective pebbles or stones of varying sizes in shades of blues, purples, greens, browns, and oranges, resembling stepping stones. Some smaller, traditional green lily pads are also present among the colorful stones.\n\nThe background is a dense, dark forest with tall, shadowy trees and lush tropical foliage, implying a nocturnal setting. Numerous glowing orbs, resembling fireflies or magical lights, are scattered throughout the forest canopy and hovering above the water, creating a soft, enchanting ambiance.\n\nThe color palette is rich and vibrant, with deep greens, blues, and browns offset by the bright, warm glows of the bottles and fireflies. The lighting is ethereal and mysterious, originating from the glowing elements. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, fantastical, and inviting, like a hidden fairy haven. The art style is clean, sharp, and highly detailed, with a slight cartoonish charm, reminiscent of Studio Ghibli or classic children's book illustrations. A subtle watermark \"c29\" is visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Jungle: Fireflies subtly pulse and drift. Water around lily pads ripples gently. Spout pours, creating consistent splashes and expanding ringlets. Light within bottles occasionally flickers and brightens.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The jungle canopy EXPLODES with fireflies, swirling into a blinding vortex! Giant lily pads LURCH and COLLIDE, sending tidal waves through the water. The colorful stones ERUPT from the surface, becoming weightless projectiles. The water spout HITS with concussive force, creating a geyser that SHATTERS the surrounding reflections. The bottles on the hut and lily pads FLARE with blinding, volatile light, SHIMMERING uncontrollably as the hut itself BUCKS and SPINS atop the crashing leaf.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fireflies glow brighter, defying light physics, as they plummet upwards, pulling the jungle canopy with them. Water ripples, then reverses, pulling the lily pads and colored stones into the void. The water from the spout transforms into shimmering light, flowing upwards into the bottle, erasing its glow. Bottles float weightlessly, their light violently oscillating, distorting the scene around them.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, ethereal zoom into the jungle canopy reveals pulsing fireflies drifting like stardust. The camera sweeps down, revealing the vibrant lily pads and stepping stones, their reflections dancing in the rippling water. A sudden, dramatic close-up on the spout shows water gushing, creating intense, expanding ringlets. Simultaneously, the bottle lights flicker once, then glow intensely, illuminating the scene.",
