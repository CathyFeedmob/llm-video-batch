    "video_prompt": "Subtle glimmering and shifting of the metallic textures on the character's skin and the golden tendrils. The bright light sources subtly flare and dim. The hot pink energy emanating from her eyes and the tendrils gently pulsates and flickers. Light particles throughout the background drift and shimmer slowly.",
    "image_prompt": "A cinematic medium portrait of a futuristic or alien human-like figure, with luminous purple eyes and a dark, textured, almost metallic skin. The figure has intricate golden/bronze metallic threads or shattered fragments emanating from and wrapped around its body, particularly around the head, neck, and shoulders. Bright, thin, electric pink/purple light streaks or lightning-like elements burst from the head, some wrapping around the eyes and face. The background is dark and diffuse, possibly with subtle starry or shimmering textures, suggesting a cosmic or ethereal environment. A bright lens flare is visible on the left side, casting a soft glow. The composition is strong, with the figure looking directly forward, and one hand gently touching the collar area. The overall atmosphere is mystical, powerful, and slightly otherworldly. There's a subtle motion blur effect, especially in the background and around the energetic elements. Subtle rainbow lens flares occur in the lower left.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle metallic shimmers and shifting on skin and tendrils. Light sources gently flare and dim. Pink energy from eyes and tendrils softly pulsates and flickers. Background light particles drift and shimmer slowly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Flickering metallic skin and golden tendrils wildly contort and writhe, shimmering explosively. Blinding light sources violently burst and supernovas. Hot pink energy from eyes and tendrils erupts in chaotic, aggressive blasts, scorching the scene. Particles in the background furiously swirl and kaleidoscope.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "\"Impossible\" Prompt:\n\nGolden tendrils reverse, flowing *into* the character's skin, which ripples like liquid metal, unveiling impossible geometric patterns. Her glowing eyes ebb, pulling hot pink energy back into impossible depths. Light particles morph into shimmering, sentient entities that playfully dance, then phase through the scene, leaving iridescent trails. The background itself distorts, revealing glimpses of other dimensions and shifting realities. Gravity occasionally inverts, causing the entire scene to briefly float upside-down.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly pushes in, a soft, ethereal light emanating from the background. As it glides, the metallic textures on the character's skin subtly shift and glimmer, catching the light. The hot pink energy from her eyes and the golden tendrils begin a gentle, rhythmic pulse, growing more intense as the camera dramatically zooms in on her piercing gaze. Tiny light particles in the background drift and shimmer, creating an otherworldly, mesmerizing dance.",
