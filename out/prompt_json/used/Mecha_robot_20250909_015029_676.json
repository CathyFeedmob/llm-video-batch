    "video_prompt": "The robot's core glows rhythmically, as if breathing. Subtle light flickers across the metal surfaces and within the articulated joints, and a faint hum vibrates throughout the scene.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA full-body shot of a highly detailed, futuristic robot standing upright. The robot is primarily black with striking accents of gold, orange, and red, and sections of white/light gray armor on the torso. Its design is sleek and angular, with visible mechanical joints and intricate inner workings partially exposed, particularly in the midsection and limb joints. The head features a golden, segmented faceplate with glowing red eyes and two prominent, pointed gold horns extending upwards. There are smaller, spiky golden protrusions on top of its head. The chest has a large, circular, glowing red core with concentric rings. The shoulders have large, upward-angled orange fins. The hands are articulated with orange fingertips and visible internal mechanics.\n\nThe lighting is bright and even, highlighting the metallic sheen and details of the robot. The background is a soft, out-of-focus futuristic cityscape with abstract lines and shapes, suggesting large buildings or structures, rendered in clean white and light grays, creating a clean and somewhat sterile atmosphere. The perspective is slightly low-angle, looking up at the robot, making it appear imposing. A subtle signature \"Ci29\" is present in the lower right, and a stylized white Asian character (possibly Chinese or Japanese) is layered over the robot's leg in the lower center.\n\n**Style:** High-tech, futuristic, mecha, sci-fi concept art, rendered in 3D with realistic textures.\n**Colors:** Dominant black, contrasting gold, orange, red, and white/light gray.\n**Lighting:** Bright, soft, diffused, highlighting metallic surfaces and glowing elements.\n**Composition:** Full-body shot, slightly low-angle, robot centered, blurred background.\n**Atmosphere:** Imposing, clean, technologically advanced.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Robot's core pulses, expanding and contracting with soft light. Gleams shift across its metallic form, highlighting the articulation of its limbs as a quiet hum subtly vibrates the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The robot's core intensifies, pulsating erratically. Sparks erupt from articulated joints, limbs twitching violently. Gears grind, metal surfaces ripple like liquid. A surge of energy blasts outwards, causing stone structures to fracture and collapse around it. The air shimmers with raw power as the robot lunges forward, an explosive blur of motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robot's core implodes into a singularity, instantly reversing its complex assembly into molecular dust that gracefully reassembles itself as a shimmering nebula. Quantum light particles dance across its form as its joints stretch impossibly, morphing into spectral serpents that phase through dimensional folds. Gravity inverts, and the robot floats upward, shattering into countless geometric fractals, each pulsing with an otherworldly hum that warps time itself.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The robot, an imposing figure of black and gold, stands amidst a futuristic cityscape. Its central core pulsates with an ethereal red glow, casting an amber light that dances across its metallic frame. The hum grows. A slow, dramatic zoom-in reveals the intricate details of its faceplate—eyes burning with intense red light. A fleeting flicker of light emanates from its left shoulder armor, followed by the clanking sound of articulated parts shifting. The camera descends slowly, highlighting the glowing red digits of its left hand as it slowly clenches into a fist, embodying its raw power.",
