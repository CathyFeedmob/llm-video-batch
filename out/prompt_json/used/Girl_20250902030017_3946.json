  "video_prompt": "Generate an anime-style video. A young girl walks away from the viewer down a sunlit path. Her dark hair sways gently with each step, and her blue pleated skirt billows softly from a gentle breeze. She casually carries a transparent umbrella over her shoulder, moving with her. Sunflowers lining the path sway subtly as the breeze rustles their leaves and heads. Fluffy clouds drift slowly across the sky, displaying soft blue and peach hues. The distant utility poles and buildings recede as she walks.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, focusing on key visual elements and artistic style:\n\n\"Anime style illustration of a serene summer scene, warm soft lighting, pastel color palette, nostalgic atmosphere. A young girl is viewed from behind, walking away down a gently curving light-colored path. She has windswept dark shoulder-length hair, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark blue pleated skirt billowing gently, bare legs, and tall shiny black boots. She holds a clear transparent umbrella over her right shoulder. Vibrant yellow sunflowers with lush green leaves and dark centers line both sides of the path, forming a dense hedge. In the left background, a tall wooden utility pole with wires and transformer, alongside faint residential buildings. In the right background, distant utility poles and small buildings with red roofs. The soft light blue sky is filled with large fluffy watercolor clouds, some tinted peach and light orange, casting a warm glow.\"",
  "refined_video_prompt": "An anime-style video depicting a young girl's steady forward motion away from the viewer. Her dark hair sways gently with each step, and her blue skirt softly billows. A transparent umbrella bobs with her stride. Sunflowers lining the path subtly sway, their leaves rustling in a breeze. Fluffy clouds drift slowly across the sky. The distant utility poles, buildings, and the sunlit path progressively recede as she walks."
