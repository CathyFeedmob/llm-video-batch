    "video_prompt": "The human figure's hair subtly sways. Small debris particles around the giant robot and human float and drift slightly. The robot's eyes softly glow with a very subtle flicker. A faint shimmer or ripple appears on the robot's metallic surfaces, as if reflecting light from an unseen source.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot from a low angle, looking up at a person in a futuristic black and metallic, form-fitting tactical suit, seen from behind. The person has short, dark, slightly windblown hair and looks towards an enormous, highly detailed, realistic mecha robot (similar to a Gundam) in the background. The mecha is overwhelmingly large, taking up most of the background, with its head and shoulders visible, and its right arm slightly raised to the side. The overall scene is set in a stark, battle-torn environment with debris, shards, and pieces of wreckage flying and scattered around the foreground and midground, suggesting an explosion or destruction.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** Humanoid figure, sleek black and metallic tactical suit, short dark hair.\n*   **Main Background Element:** Gigantic mecha robot, complex mechanical details, grey and dark grey with hints of maroon/red accents, glowing blue eyes.\n*   **Environment:** Debris, shattered fragments, dust, implied destruction.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Realistic and highly detailed, with a cinematic sci-fi feel.\n*   Gritty and post-apocalyptic undertones.\n*   Mecha art style.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Angle:** Low angle, looking up, emphasizing the scale of the mecha.\n*   **Framing:** Full shot of the person, with the mecha dominating the background.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The person is placed slightly off-center, leading the eye towards the mecha.\n*   **Depth of Field:** Shallow depth of field focusing on the foreground figure, while the mecha remains mostly in focus but slightly less sharp due to its immense size and distance.\n*   **Elements:** Dynamic scattered debris creates movement and adds tension.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Monochromatic palette of greys, blacks, and whites.\n*   **Accents:** Subtle maroon/red on the mecha, faint blue glow from the mecha's eyes.\n*   **Overall Mood:** Bleak, stark, powerful.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Source:** Diffused, bright, almost blown-out light source from behind and above the mecha, suggesting an open, possibly destroyed sky or an intense energy burst.\n*   **Shadows:** Soft but defined shadows on the suit and mecha, adding depth.\n*   **Highlights:** Glints of light on metal and slick surfaces of the suit and mecha.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Intense, dramatic, epic, and a sense of awe/confrontation.\n*   Vast scale and power.\n*   Slightly ominous or melancholic.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n*   High detail, ultra-realistic, photorealistic.\n*   Dynamic pose.\n*   Epic scale.\n*   C29 watermark at the bottom right.
