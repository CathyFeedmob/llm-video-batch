  "video_prompt": "A large hot pot simmers with bubbling broth and rising steam. Numerous stylized figures actively add ingredients from ladles and trays, stir the pot, and arrange food. Ingredients visibly drop, pour, and settle within the pot. The scene evokes continuous, collaborative cooking amidst shifting ingredients and utensils.",
  "image_prompt": "A high-angle, slightly isometric illustration of a large black hot pot or skillet filled with simmering reddish-brown broth and an array of colorful raw ingredients: marbled red meat, leafy greens (spinach, pak choi), enoki mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, cubed tofu, green peas, thin white noodles, and bright orange fish balls. Numerous small, stylized figures in traditional white or blue chef uniforms busy around the pot, adding ingredients like raw meat with ladles or stirring. The scene is set on a warm, rustic wooden surface with scattered small white bowls of condiments (peas, beans, yellow paste, brown sauce) and wooden trays of vegetables and meat. The vibrant scene depicts communal cooking and fresh ingredients.",

Hands swiftly stir the contents, arranging items. Ingredients visibly drop, pour, and settle into the agitated liquid. The figures' expressions show focused collaboration as utensils shift and are handled, maintaining a dynamic flow of ongoing cooking."
