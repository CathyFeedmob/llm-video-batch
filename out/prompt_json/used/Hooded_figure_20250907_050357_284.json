    "video_prompt": "A subtle, slow pan upward reveals more of the swirling dust and debris around the glowing ring. The figure's cloak gently billows in the wind, and a faint shimmering emanates from the glowing ring, causing slight fluctuations in its intensity. Tiny specks of dust and sand continuously drift and rise from the ground, especially near the figure's feet and around the glowing circle.",
    "image_prompt": "A full shot of a mysterious figure in a dark, flowing robe standing in a sandy desert landscape. A glowing, golden-white ring of light encircles them, and dust and small rocks are swept up in the air around the ring, creating a dynamic, turbulent effect. The sky is a dusty, atmospheric orange and grey, with a bright light source suggesting a sun in the upper left. The ground is a textured, reddish-brown sand, with some dust swirling around the figure's feet. The overall style is cinematic and epic, with dramatic lighting and a sense of otherworldly power. A stylized \"b29\" signature is in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera slowly tilts up. Dust and debris swirl and rise. Cloak gently billows. Ring flickers softly. Ground particles continuously drift and lift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The desert floor ERUPTS, launching boulders into the air. The luminous ring PULSATES, disorienting everything. The shrouded figure's cloak violently whips, tearing at the fabric. Dust and sand EXPLODE upward in a turbulent cyclonic vortex, materializing into spectral, attacking forms from the ground. The ring's light INTENSIFIES to blinding flashes, unleashing arcs of raw energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "As the camera pans, the glowing ring becomes a swirling vortex, pulling dust and the figure's cloak inward, then violently expelling everything, reversing its movement. The figure's body twists and reforms like liquid metal, their feet dissolving into a shower of light that defies all gravity, floating upwards into the ethereal luminescence of the rings. Time itself seems to fracture within the frame, showing multiple moments of this impossible transformation simultaneously, creating a kaleidoscopic, dreamlike ascent.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**(Dramatic Low Angle, Slow Dolly In)** From a low angle, a figure in a flowing cloak emerges through swirling dust, backlit by an ethereal, shimmering ring. As the camera subtly dollies in, the ring pulses brighter, sending ripples across the desert floor. **(Quick Zoom, Focus on Feet)** Tiny debris swirls, kicked up by the figure's determined steps amidst the glowing light. The cloak dramatically billows, revealing glints of light reflecting off its fabric.",
