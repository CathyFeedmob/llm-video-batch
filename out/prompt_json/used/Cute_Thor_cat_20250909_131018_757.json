    "video_prompt": "A subtle slow zoom out reveals the full rainbow bridge, the cat's tail sways gently, and its tiny cape flutters. The background stars twinkle and shift slightly, with a faint, shimmering nebula effect. The cat blinks slowly once, and its whiskers twitch almost imperceptibly.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant and charming full-body shot of a fluffy, cute orange tabby kitten, styled as Thor, standing on a miniature rainbow bridge. The kitten has large, bright green eyes and a tiny, contented smile. It wears a dark blue and grey armored vest with silver circular accents and a red cape that flows gently behind it. On its head are small, stylized white wing emblems, reminiscent of Thor's helmet.\n\nThe kitten holds a miniature Mjolnir (Thor's hammer) in its right paw, which is detailed with a metallic head and a brown, textured handle. Its left paw is resting lightly on the railing of the rainbow bridge. The bridge itself features distinct, vibrant bands of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\nThe background is a soft, deep blue and purple nebula with scattered, out-of-focus bokeh lights resembling distant stars, creating a magical and ethereal atmosphere. The lighting is soft and ambient, highlighting the kitten's fur and the metallic glint of its armor and hammer. The overall style is a blend of cute, whimsical, and heroic, with a focus on detailed textures and bright, inviting colors. The composition is dynamic, showing the kitten from a slightly low angle, making it appear grand and powerful in its miniature form.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle zoom out. Cat's tail sways, cape flutters. Stars twinkle and shift; faint nebula shimmers. Cat blinks slowly; whiskers twitch minimally.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The rainbow bridge suddenly shatters into a swirling vortex of color, catapulting the Thor-cat into the shimmering nebula! Mjolnir crackles with furious energy, expanding into a colossal cosmic hammer. The cat, now a giant feline god of thunder, roars, its cape whipping violently as celestial lightning erupts from its paws, tearing through the cosmos. Stars explode in a dazzling supernova behind it as it charges forward, tail thrashing, eyes blazing.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cat's tail unspools into a vibrant aurora borealis, expanding outward to engulf the rainbow bridge, which then dissolves into shimmering stardust. The hammer, momentarily suspended, blossoms into a galactic swirl, orbiting the now-floating cat, whose whiskers extend into cosmic tendrils. A reverse ripple effect pulls the starry background into a single, blinding point of light behind the cat.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A subtle slow zoom out reveals the full rainbow bridge, the cat's tail sways gently, and its tiny cape flutters. The background stars twinkle and shift slightly, with a faint, shimmering nebula effect. The cat blinks slowly once, and its whiskers twitch almost imperceptibly. As a dramatic drumroll begins, the camera rapidly tracks forward, pushing past the cat's face, then slowly pulls back to reveal the cat's powerful stance, Mjolnir now crackling with subtle lightning. The bridge glows brighter, a celestial chorus swells, and the cat lets out a tiny, determined roar.",
