    "video_prompt": "The large celestial body slowly rotates, revealing more of its luminous surface. The white, swirling disk below subtly expands and contracts, with faint light particles streaking outward from its core. The smaller scattered debris drifts gently upwards and downwards. Subtle twinkling of distant stars.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA surreal, epic space scene with a celestial black hole event. The composition is a vertical panorama. In the upper half, a giant, light blue, hazy gas giant planet fills the top left, illuminated from the right. Below it, at the center of the image, is a prominent, highly detailed, chaotic accretion disk, appearing like a spiral galaxy in motion. Its outer rings are a bright, smooth light blue-grey, spiraling inwards towards a turbulent, glowing, dark blue and orange-hued black hole at its core, spewing brilliant blue and orange flares and particles. Scattered around the black hole and accretion disk are bright, distant stars and nebulae in tones of blue, yellow, and orange, creating depth in the dark cosmic background.\n\nIn the lower half of the image, a realistic depiction of Earth's curvature is visible, with soft, diffused light blue and white atmospheric layers transitioning into the dark of space. Fluffy white and gray clouds cover parts of the Earth's surface, illuminated by a gentle, soft light source. From the central black hole event, a vertical torrent of large, dark, irregular asteroid-like rocks and debris descends towards Earth, creating a dramatic visual link between the cosmic event and the planet below. Some of these rocks are obscured by the upper atmospheric clouds of Earth, hinting at impact. The overall lighting is dramatic and otherworldly, with stark contrasts between the glowing celestial elements and the dark void, and a soft glow on Earth. The color palette is dominated by cool blues, whites, and varying shades of dark blue and black, with accents of bright orange and yellow from the stars and event. Hyperrealistic, detailed, high resolution, cinematic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Focus on Movement & Change:**\n\nThe large celestial body rotates, its luminous surface expanding into view. The white, swirling disk below subtly pulsates, emitting faint, outward-streaking light particles. Scattered debris gently drifts. Distant stars subtly twinkle.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The massive celestial body violently rips open, unleashing a maelstrom of light. The white, swirling disk below erupts, spewing explosive light particles that lash out. Debris, suddenly imbued with force, careens upward with incredible speed, twisting and colliding. Distant stars flicker erratically, as if destabilized by the chaotic energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A colossal planet, half-submerged in a nebula, exhales shimmering particles that coalesce into a fluid, self-consuming ring. From the planet's core, liquid stars drip *upwards* into an impossibly stretching void, their light warping the surrounding space like soft fabric. Debris floats *down* through the sky, dissolving into the atmosphere as it touches the clouds below.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping cinematic shot reveals a grand celestial body rotating, its luminous surface slowly unveiled. A captivating, swirling white disk below pulses with expanding and contracting light, while shimmering particles streak from its core, drawing the eye. Scattered debris dramatically drifts, and the camera pulls back to reveal a twinkling, distant star field, enhancing the immense scale.",
