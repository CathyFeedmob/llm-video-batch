  "video_prompt": "Rider's hands smoothly grip handlebars, while the bicycle glides along a gravel road. Poppies sway, fields ripple, and distant mountains shift slightly with movement. Flowers in the basket gently bounce. Clouds drift, light subtly changes, and the scene flows with the gentle rhythm of a bike ride. ",
  "image_prompt": "First-person view of a serene bicycle ride through a vibrant red poppy field. Light-skinned hands grip black and brown handlebars, with a prominent wicker basket overflowing with colorful tulips, daisies, and a silver bell. The bicycle is on a light gravel road, leading towards majestic snow-capped mountains and rolling green hills under a bright, clear blue sky with scattered clouds.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Rider's hands subtly adjust on handlebars. The bicycle propels forward, causing gravel to blur and shift beneath. Poppies sway, fields ripple, and distant mountains gradually alter perspective. Basket flowers gently bounce. Clouds drift, and ambient light subtly shifts, generating a dynamic flow that echoes the bike's gentle rhythm."
