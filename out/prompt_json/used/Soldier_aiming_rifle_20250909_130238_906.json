    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a detailed anime-inspired female character, about 20-25 years old, with long straight black hair and bangs, wearing a dark olive green long tactical jacket, black tactical shorts, black gloves, and black boots. She also wears black headphones with a microphone. She is in a low crouch, left knee on the ground, holding a modern assault rifle with a scope, aiming directly forward towards the viewer. Her eyes are light green, intensely focused through the scope, with a slightly serious or determined expression. The rifle is prominently featured, extending towards the viewer. The setting is an old, abandoned industrial or railway bridge, with dark metal girders and rusty tracks visible. The lighting is diffused and atmospheric, with hints of an overcast sky or twilight, creating a slightly desaturated, cool color palette dominated by greys, dark greens, and muted blues. There are subtle light sources in the background, possibly streetlights or distant building lights, creating a soft bokeh effect. The overall mood is serious and tactical, with a focus on realism blended with stylized anime aesthetics. The composition places the character centrally, with the bridge structure framing her in the background, emphasizing depth and perspective.\n\n**Breakdown of elements and reasoning:**\n\n*   **Subject:** \"Full body shot of a detailed anime-inspired female character, about 20-25 years old, with long straight black hair and bangs...\" (Captures her appearance and style)\n*   **Clothing/Accessories:** \"...wearing a dark olive green long tactical jacket, black tactical shorts, black gloves, and black boots.

    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few refined options, focusing on dynamic elements and avoiding static descriptions, while staying under 100 words:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on subtle, connected movements):**\n\"Head subtly tilts, eyes track a new focal point. Hair gently sways with the motion. Coat fabric ripples along the torso. A faint glint shifts across the scope's lens.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Emphasizing a chain reaction of movement):**\n\"A slight head turn initiates hair's soft sway. Eyes subtly shift focus. Fabric ripples cascade down the coat. A fleeting glint traverses the scope.\"\n\n**Option 3 (More active verbs for nuance):**\n\"Head smoothly inclines, eyes smoothly divert. Hair delicately oscillates. Coat fabric subtly undulates. A tiny gleam dances across the scope.\"",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden jolt - entire bridge structure violently sways, light fixtures explode into showering sparks. Hair whips around as the rifle snaps up, scope lens flaring intensely. Coat fabric rips and tears, billowing wildly as the ground beneath shatters, sending dust and debris spiraling upward in a powerful vortex. The entire scene pulsates with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The girl's eye pupils expand into shimmering cosmic nebulae, her hair strands morph into wisps of starlight twirling against a backdrop of reversing time, dissolving the bridge into a liquid abstract art. The rifle dissolves into a constellation, its scope a swirling vortex pulling the sky down into shattered reflective shards. Her coat ripples into an ocean of impossibly vibrant, breathing fabric, constantly changing form and color, revealing glimpses of other dimensions within its folds.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cold breeze lifts hair strands as the sniper steadies her aim, eyes narrowing. The camera subtly dollies forward, a slow zoom on the green reticle of the scope, then pulls back and sweeps around her, revealing the weathered bridge structure. A sudden, dramatic shift in lighting casts her in sharp relief as a distant, metallic clang echoes, making her flinch minimally but regain focus.",
