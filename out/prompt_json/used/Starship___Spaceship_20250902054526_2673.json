    "video_prompt": "Futuristic megaships drift slowly across a cosmic backdrop of subtly shifting nebulae. Intense magenta, teal, and cyan light beams streak and crisscross the vast expanse. A glowing energy ring pulsates gently. Numerous agile spaceships zip rapidly through the scene, leaving vibrant thruster trails. Groups of ships fly in formation alongside the colossal structures, their engines brightly glowing, creating a bustling atmosphere of constant motion and advanced cosmic activity.",
    "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly longer to very concise, all designed for an image generation model:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Comprehensive):**\n\n> Breathtaking, highly detailed futuristic space scene with a dynamic composition and vertical structures, conveying immense scale and motion. Deep cosmic expanse background with star-studded purples, blues, and magenta nebulae. Luminous crisscrossing light beams in magenta-pink, teal, and cyan. Large glowing pinkish-purple energy ring focal point. Dominant immense metallic, modular megaships/space stations, resembling futuristic cities, with intricate paneling and multi-colored glowing internal lights (teal, cyan, orange, red, purple). Numerous smaller, sleek, agile spaceships with bright headlights and vibrant thruster trails (orange, purple, blue). Intense neon lighting, high contrast, advanced technology, rapid movement, epic scale. Cinematic, photorealistic, 8K, volumetric lighting.\n\n**Option 2 (Concise & Focused):**\n\n> Dynamic futuristic space scene, epic scale. Neon lighting, high contrast. Deep space background with purple, blue, magenta nebulae. Crisscrossing magenta-pink, teal, cyan light beams. Glowing pink-purple energy ring. Colossal metallic megaships/space stations with intricate, multi-colored glowing lights. Sleek agile spaceships with bright thruster trails (orange, purple, blue). Cinematic, highly detailed, 8K.\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise - Keyword-rich):**\n\n> Futuristic space, neon, epic scale. Dynamic, vertical structures. Cosmic nebulae: purple, blue, magenta. Light beams: magenta-pink, teal, cyan, crisscrossing. Pink-purple energy ring. Colossal megaships, detailed metallic, glowing lights. Agile spaceships, colorful thrusters. High contrast, cinematic, 8K.\n\n**Recommendation:** Option 1 or 2 would likely yield the best results as they provide sufficient detail without being overly verbose. Option 1 is best if you want to ensure all described elements are strongly represented. Option 2 is a good balance."
