  "video_prompt": "Mechanical elements within a vast, hazily lit, industrial cityscape hum, subtly shifting. Elevated walkways and pipes vibrate. Distant structures flicker with internal, pulsating yellow-orange lights. A spherical metallic object suspended in the air gently undulates, its tethers swaying. The overall atmosphere subtly darkens and lightens, mimicking a passing haze.",
  "image_prompt": "Highly detailed, futuristic, industrial cityscape, with towering structures of intricate metal plates, pipes, vents, platforms, and railings. Dominant colors are rust-reds, grays, and aged greens, creating a weathered, dystopian feel. Massive cylindrical and spherical structures anchor the foreground, connected by elevated walkways, metal beams, and orange cables. A large, spherical metallic object is suspended in the hazy, overcast sky. The scene is filled with complex machinery, fine details, and glowing yellow/orange light sources in the background.",
