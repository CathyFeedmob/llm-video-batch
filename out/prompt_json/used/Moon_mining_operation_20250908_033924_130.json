    "video_prompt": "Subtle flickering and pulsing of the blue energy beams emanating from the lunar structures. Faint shimmering and slow drift of starlight across the dark sky. Gentle, almost imperceptible atmospheric haze around Earth, suggesting very slow circulation.",
    "image_prompt": "A hyperrealistic, high-detail full shot capturing a futuristic scene on the moon's surface. In the foreground and mid-ground, numerous metallic, industrial-looking structures, resembling power generators or communication towers, stand on the desolate, cratered lunar ground. Each structure emits powerful, upward-streaming beams of bright blue light that extend into the dark, star-filled sky.\n\nIn the background, a large, vibrant Earth hangs prominently, partially obscured by the light beams emanating from the lunar structures. The Earth displays clear continents and cloud patterns, illuminated partially, creating a glow around its edges. The atmosphere is dark and deep space, with countless tiny stars scattered across the backdrop.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic, with the intense blue light beams providing the primary illumination, casting reflections and highlights on the metallic structures and the lunar surface. The blue light contrasts sharply with the deep black of space and the subtle, natural colors of Earth. The overall color palette is dominated by metallic grays, deep blues, and the natural hues of Earth.\n\nThe composition is wide and expansive, showcasing the vastness of space and the multitude of structures. The perspective is slightly low-angle, emphasizing the height and power of the light beams and the grandeur of Earth. The style is sci-fi, realistic, and slightly ethereal due to the light beams. The atmosphere evokes a sense of advanced technology, cosmic scale, and perhaps a touch of mystery or power.\n\nNo watermarks or text visible. Shot with a wide-angle lens, maintaining sharp focus from foreground to background.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Dynamic Light & Atmosphere:**\n\nBlue energy beams *flicker and pulse* from lunar structures. Starlight *shimmers and drifts* faintly across the dark sky. Atmospheric haze around Earth *subtly circulates*, almost imperceptibly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Dynamic Visuals:** Blue energy beams surge and snap with uncontrolled power, violently tearing through the lunar air. Starlight blazes and streaks across the sky as if stars themselves are in a frantic dance. The Earth's atmosphere pulses and roils, revealing phantom shifts and explosive atmospheric currents, hinting at a planet undergoing immense stress. Structures on the lunar surface vibrate and clatter, their internal mechanisms grinding and straining.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Lunar structures pulsed in reverse, drawing blue energy from Earth, causing oceans to swirl skyward. Stars morphed into ancient glyphs, their light rewinding into nebulae. The moon's surface rippled like water, reflecting an impossible, shifting kaleidoscope of cosmic dust. Gravity inverted, sending Earth gently spiraling inward, its continents folding like origami.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly glides across the lunar surface, revealing the vast array of glowing structures. It then dramatically swoops upwards, the blue energy beams erupting towards the distant, faintly glowing Earth. As the camera circles, a series of the structures slowly rotate, intensifying their beams, causing a subtle, pulsating ripple effect across the Earth's atmosphere. A final, slow push-in shot emphasizes the immense power being harnessed, with the stars twinkling in silent awe.",
