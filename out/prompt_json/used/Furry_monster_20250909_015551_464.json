    "video_prompt": "A subtle shift in the yeti's fur as if a gentle breeze passes, its eyes blinking slowly, and a slight tilt of its head. The clouds in the sky drift lazily, and a faint shimmer appears on the mountainsides, suggesting light reflecting off distant rock faces.",
    "image_prompt": "A digital matte painting showcasing a giant, furry, light gray creature with large, expressive brown eyes, small ears, and sharp claws, positioned majestically among towering, rugged mountains. The creature’s head and upper body are visible, with its large paws resting on mountain peaks, suggesting immense scale. The mountains are characterized by steep, jagged rock faces and patches of green vegetation, indicative of a lush, rocky terrain. The sky is a clear, bright blue with scattered white clouds, creating a sense of openness and grandeur. The lighting is soft and natural, suggesting daylight, with subtle shadows defining the mountain contours and the creature's fur. The overall atmosphere is awe-inspiring and slightly fantastical, with a clean and polished aesthetic. The composition uses a low-angle shot, emphasizing the creature's colossal size against the vast landscape. Text overlays on the image, \"AI 生成\" in the top left and \"C29\" in a stylized, handwritten font in the bottom right, imply a digital origin and a specific designation.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The yeti's fur gently sways, its eyes slowly blink, and its head subtly tilts. Clouds drift languidly across the sky, and the distant mountainsides shimmer faintly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The yeti roars, fur thrashing violently as it rips a mountain peak from its foundation. Jagged rocks explode outwards, catapulting into the wildly swirling sky. Clouds collide, generating furious lightning strikes that crackle and fuse with the yeti's glowing eyes as its colossal claws gouge deep chasms into the earth.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The yeti's fur transforms into a swirling galaxy, its eyes becoming twin suns that blink and nova. Mountains unravel into shimmering ribbons, drifting upwards into a sky where clouds birth geometric shapes, then invert to become liquid light. The yeti's head revolves impossibly fast, its features morphing into a mosaic of cosmic dust, then reforming. Each element shifts like a mirage, defying solid form, a constant symphony of impossible motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera begins with a slow, wide shot, subtly revealing the colossal yeti, fur rippling with an unseen breeze. As it blinks its immense, brown eyes, the camera begins a dramatic, slow zoom. A gust of wind suddenly sweeps across the mountain peak, causing the yeti to gently tilt its furry head, its gaze softening. Simultaneously, the sky shifts, casting a warm golden light on the distant peaks, making them shimmer dramatically.",
