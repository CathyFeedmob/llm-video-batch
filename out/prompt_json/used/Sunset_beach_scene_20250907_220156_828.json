    "image_prompt": "A full body shot of a mesmerizing digital artwork featuring a beach sunset scene intricately entwined within abstract, flowing smoke-like ribbons against a gradient background.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Central Image:** A vibrant beach sunset with a large, bright sun low on the horizon casting a golden glow across the water and wet sand. Gentle waves are breaking on the shore, creating white foam. Several silhouetted figures (a family of three â€“ two adults and a child) are walking on the beach towards the distant sun. Other smaller silhouettes of people are visible further down the beach.\n*   **Abstract Ribbons:** Transparent, flowing ribbons, resembling smoke or abstract silk, swirl and undulate around and through the beach scene. The ribbons are mainly a dark teal/blue-green color, but they pick up the warm orange and pink hues of the sunset where they overlap the beach scene, creating a sense of dynamic transparency and color blending. They originate from the top left and bottom right corners, creating a vertical, winding composition.\n*   **Gradient Background:** The background transitions smoothly from a warm, muted yellow-beige at the top left to a cool, desaturated blue-gray at the bottom right.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Digital Art / Photomanipulation:** Blending of realistic photography with abstract digital elements.\n*   **Abstract Expressionism (with photographic elements):** The flowing ribbons add an abstract, artistic quality.\n*   **Dreamlike / Ethereal:** The transparency and flowing nature of the ribbons evoke a sense of dreaminess.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Vertical Orientation:** The image is taller than it is wide.\n*   **Dynamic and Flowing:** The ribbons create strong diagonal and curved lines, guiding the eye through the composition.\n*   **Foreground (Ribbons), Midground (Beach Scene), Background (Gradient):** Clear layering.\n*   **Rule of Thirds (implicit):** The beach horizon and the sun are roughly aligned with horizontal and vertical thirds, respectively.\n*   **Asymmetrical Balance:** The composition is balanced through the interplay of the prominent ribbons and the central beach scene.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Warm Tones (Sunset):** Rich oranges, yellows, and reds for the sun, sky, and reflections on the water/sand.\n*   **Cool Tones (Ribbons/Background):** Deep teal, blue-green, desaturated blues, and grays, providing a strong contrast to the warm sunset.\n*   **Gradient Transition:** The background transitions from warm yellow-beige to cool blue-gray.\n*   **Color Blending:** Where the cool ribbons overlap the warm sunset, they take on mixed, muted warm tones.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Sunset Lighting:** Soft, warm, and radiant light from the low sun.\n*   **Dramatic Silhouettes:** The people on the beach are silhouetted against the bright sunset.\n*   **Reflective Surfaces:** The wet sand and water reflect the sunlight intensely.\n*   **Translucency:** The ribbons are lit from behind and within, showing their transparent quality and how they interact with the light from the sunset.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Serene and Tranquil:** The sunset and calm beach scene evoke peacefulness.\n*   **Mysterious and Artistic:** The abstract ribbons add an element of intrigue and artistic expression.\n*   **Harmonious:** The blending of warm and cool tones, and natural elements with abstract forms, creates a sense of harmony.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   **Hidden brand/text:** \"c29\" in a stylized white font with a slight shadow, located in the bottom right corner, partially blending with the dark ribbons. This should be minimal or omitted if focusing purely on the visual art.\n\n**Concise Prompt:**\nA vibrant digital art and photo manipulation blending. A serene beach sunset scene with silhouetted figures walking on wet sand, golden light reflecting on the water, encased within and partially obscured by flowing, transparent abstract ribbons of dark teal and blue-green hues. The ribbons create a dynamic, winding vertical composition against a soft gradient background shifting from warm beige to cool blue-gray. Dreamlike, ethereal, dynamic lighting. White \"c29\" text subtly placed in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Translucent ribbons subtly undulate, rippling across the scene. Waves softly lap the shore. Sunset hues glow with a faint, internal shimmer. Distant figures exhibit a slight, natural sway as if walking.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**The translucent ribbons whip violently, tearing through the beach scene in a chaotic storm.** Ocean waves surge and crash with explosive force, consumed by a fierce, internal fire as the sunset erupts into a pulsating inferno. The distant figures on the sand are suddenly flung into the air, caught in the vortex of a supernatural maelstrom. Every element convulses, transforms, and explodes with overwhelming power.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Translucent ribbons, now liquid light, flow *backwards* into the sunset, absorbing waves and re-forming the shimmering sun. Figures on the beach solidify, then ripple into the sand as the light drains from the sky, leaving swirling nebulae. The entire scene reverses, colors bleeding into negative, then collapsing into an impossible, silent flicker.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle, sweeping drone shot glides over the translucent, undulating ribbons, revealing the shimmering beach scene within. As the camera dips, a dramatic, quick zoom-in focuses on the vibrant sunset, which pulsates with an ethereal glow. Waves crash with rhythmic intensity, and shadows lengthen as a lone figure on the sand abruptly stops, casting a long silhouette towards the setting sun. The ribbons subtly tighten around the scene, amplifying the dramatic light and movement.",
