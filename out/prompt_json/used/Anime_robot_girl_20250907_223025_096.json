    "video_prompt": "Raindrops gently hit the surface, subtly running down the robot's armor. The small blue light on the robot's head flickers softly. The girl's white hair sways with the faint breeze, a few strands subtly shifting. Her eyes blink occasionally. A very subtle slow zoom out reveals more of the rainy environment.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that could recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A beautiful, young female character with long, flowing white hair and striking blue eyes, gazing directly at the viewer with a soft, determined expression. She is leaning against or embracing a sleek, futuristic combat robot (mech) companion.\n\n**Character Details:** White, spiky, wild hair with a halo-like glow around the top, extending down past her shoulders. Fair skin with subtle blush on cheeks and faint freckles or delicate makeup. Thin, defined eyebrows. Small, silver or dark-colored, intricate ear accessories/earrings. Her attire is practical and somewhat futuristic, appearing layered with hints of purplish-pink fabric under light-colored, perhaps armored or durable, outer material.\n\n**Robot Details:** The robot is a large, white, highly detailed mech with visible intricate internal components (wires, pistons, gears) in dark metallic tones (black, brass, copper) especially around the head/neck and shoulder joints. It has a single bright blue light on the side of its head, indicating functionality or an \"eye.\" The white plating of the robot is splattered with abstract, vibrant paint marks (pink, yellow, blue, green), giving it a personalized or combat-worn artistic flair. The surface of the robot is textured and appears to be made of a durable, slightly worn metal.\n\n**Composition:** Medium close-up, 3/4ths body shot. The female character is positioned slightly to the right, looking back over her left shoulder towards the viewer. Her head is angled slightly down, engaging the viewer with her eyes. The robot's head and right shoulder dominate the left foreground, supporting the female character and creating a sense of companionship or protection. The perspective is slightly low-angle, looking up at the characters, emphasizing their presence. Rain streaks diagonally through the scene, adding dynamism.\n\n**Environment/Atmosphere:** Rainy, outdoor, somewhat gritty, futuristic setting. The background is blurred and indistinct, suggesting an urban or industrial environment during a downpour, with muted, cool tones (grays, blues). The overall mood is serious but with an underlying tenderness, a blend of combat-ready and human emotion.\n\n**Lighting:** Dramatic and dynamic, suggesting an overcast day with rain. Strong rim lighting on the white hair, making it glow. The blue light on the robot's head casts a subtle glow. Reflections and highlights are present on the wet surfaces of the robot and the characters, especially on slick surfaces due to rain.\n\n**Style:** Hyperrealistic, highly detailed, sci-fi anime/illustration. Inspired by character design from games like Nier: Automata or art by Ilya Kuvshinov, but with a unique, slightly more rugged and painterly feel for the robot's textures and paint marks. High fidelity textures and material rendering.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by cool blues and greys for the background and rain, contrasted with the bright white of the hair and robot, punctuated by the vibrant pink, yellow, blue, and green paint splatters. The female character's skin tones are natural and warm.\n\n**Artistic Touches:** Visible rain streaks (motion blur on rain), water droplets on surfaces, subtle lens flare or atmospheric effects. The signature \"c29\" in neon blue in the bottom right corner (if allowed by the specific model).\n\n**Aspect Ratio:** Vertical, portrait (approx. 9:16).",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Raindrops ripple and streak across the robot’s armor. Its headlamp flickers. The girl’s hair sways gently, individual strands shifting. Her eyes blink. A gradual, almost imperceptible zoom out expands the rainy scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rain explodes off the robot's armor, its blue light flaring erratically. The girl's white hair whips violently, strands lashing out as her eyes dart and widen with fear. The robot's whole body jolts, joints grinding as it lurches forward suddenly. The rain around them reverses course, surging upward in a chaotic vortex, defying gravity. The very air around them shimmers with an unseen force distorting vision.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "As raindrops reverse, defying gravity, they pull up the robot's paint, leaving swirling colors suspended in air. The blue light on its head pulses, morphing into a tiny nebula from which the girl's white hair erupts, writhing like ethereal tentacles. Her eyes, now glowing portals, draw the entire scene inwards, collapsing reality into an impossible, shifting kaleidoscope.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Raindrops cascade, blurring the robot's painted armor as a dramatic slow zoom-out reveals it cradling the white-haired girl. Her icy blue eyes, wide and unblinking, subtly dart left as the camera performs an arc to the right, emphasizing her connection to the imposing yet gentle machine. A soft, single tear escapes her eye, catching the light as a subtle, warm glow pulses from the robot's chest, momentarily illuminating her face against the stark, rainy environment.",
