    "video_prompt": "A female cyborg on a futuristic hoverbike flies over a sprawling cyber city at sunset. Her dark hair sways gently in the wind. The hoverbike emits a subtle, swirling dust trail as it moves forward. Distant city lights twinkle softly. The camera subtly floats up and down, mimicking slight turbulence.",
    "image_prompt": "A futuristic scene featuring a female pilot on a sleek, white and silver hoverbike. She is suspended high above a sprawling sci-fi city bathed in the warm, golden light of a setting sun.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Female Pilot:** Wearing a form-fitting, white and light grey sci-fi suit with robotic-looking joints. She has short, dark hair blowing slightly in the wind and a focused expression.\n*   **Hoverbike:** A highly detailed, futuristic vehicle with a streamlined, elongated design, predominantly white and metallic silver. It features a transparent canopy/windshield, exposed mechanical components, intricate paneling, and glowing blue accents visible on some parts.\n*   **Cityscape:** A sprawling, complex urban environment with multi-tiered structures, elevated pathways, and large, blocky buildings rendered in neutral tones like concrete and metal. Some buildings appear to be interconnected by bridges or larger structures.\n*   **Atmospheric Effects:** Traces of light brown dust or exhaust trail from the hoverbike, emphasizing its movement and the surrounding air.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk:** Highly detailed, realistic rendering of futuristic technology and architecture.\n*   **Hyperrealism:** Sharp focus, intricate textures, and realistic lighting to create a sense of tangibility.\n*   **Concept Art:** Evokes the style of high-fidelity concept art for video games or films.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Dynamic Angle:** Shot from a slightly low angle, looking up at the pilot and hoverbike, making them appear majestic against the backdrop of the city.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The pilot's head is positioned roughly at the upper-left intersection, and the hoverbike extends diagonally across the frame.\n*   **Depth of Field:** The hoverbike and pilot are in sharp focus, while the cityscape gradually blurs into the background, creating a sense of depth and scale.\n*   **Leading Lines:** The diagonal lines of the hoverbike and the architectural elements of the city guide the viewer's eye through the scene.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Colors:** Warm golden yellows and oranges from the sunset, contrasting with the cool whites, silvers, and greys of the hoverbike and suit.\n*   **Accents:** Small pops of red, green, and blue on the hoverbike's controls.\n*   **Haze:** A warm, dusty haze permeates the distant cityscape.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Golden Hour Lighting:** Strong directional light from a low, setting sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the metallic surfaces of the hoverbike.\n*   **Backlighting/Rim Lighting:** The edges of the pilot and hoverbike are kissed by the golden light, creating a strong silhouette effect in places and giving them a luminous quality.\n*   **Reflective Surfaces:** The metallic components of the hoverbike reflect the warm light, appearing bright and polished.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Futuristic & Advanced:** Conveys a sense of high technology and a developed civilization.\n*   **Expansive & Grand:** Emphasizes the vastness of the city and the freedom of movement.\n*   **Dynamic & Speedy:** The wind-blown hair and motion blur hints at rapid movement.\n*   **Serene (despite movement):** The warm, soft lighting creates a somewhat peaceful, almost dreamlike quality.\n\n**Prompt structure:**\n\"Highly detailed render of a female pilot in a white futuristic suit on a sleek, silver and white hoverbike soaring above a vast, multi-tiered sci-fi city. Golden hour lighting, warm light from a setting sun, dust trails from the hoverbike, focused expression on pilot, sharp focus on foreground, blurred background cityscape, dynamic low-angle shot. Sci-fi, hyperrealism, concept art style. Warm orange and yellow hues contrasting with cool metallic tones.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The camera sways with turbulent motion. The cyborg's hair blows in the wind. The hoverbike leaves a swirling dust trail. Distant city lights subtly twinkle.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The cyber city roars to life: buildings buckle and twist, their metallic skins rippling like water. The hoverbike's exhaust erupts into a violent vortex, throwing the rider intensely off-balance as the bike swerves wildly. Distant structures violently collapse, sending plumes of smoke skyward. Energy surges, flickering and arcing, as the cityscape undergoes a dramatic, explosive transformation. The camera lurches and flails erratically, mirroring the chaotic, unforeseen phenomena.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A reverse-gravity ballet: the cyborg and bike float *downwards* into the sky, the city buildings slowly *ascending* from below. The dust trail subtly *absorbs* back into the bike, pulling nearby dust motes *upwards*. Sunset hues *invert* within the city, bleeding into the sky as light *flows inwards*. The camera *melds* with the bike, rotating with the cityscape, defying all up and down.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A majestic, rising wide shot reveals a female cyborg on a sleek hoverbike, soaring through a cyberpunk city at sunset. The camera smoothly zooms into her resolute face, her dark hair realistically billowing. A quick pan follows the bike as it accelerates, leaving a shimmering dust trail. As the camera dips, city lights flicker below, then rises again, framing the powerful hoverbike for a dramatic closing shot.",
