    "video_prompt": "Subtle pulsating glow emanating from the reflective surfaces of the suit, especially on the chest and limbs. The tendrils behind her slightly ripple and undulate, as if reacting to an unseen current. Tiny, reflective particles drift upwards from the floor, catching the light and creating a shimmery effect. The subtle gleam on the floor slowly shifts and expands, suggesting a slight camera push-in.",
    "image_prompt": "A full shot of a menacing, sleek, and highly detailed female symbiote character, possibly inspired by Venom or Carnage, standing upright in a dimly lit, futuristic or industrial setting. The character is rendered in highly reflective, dark metallic or obsidian material, giving her a polished, almost liquid-like appearance. She has a humanoid form but with exaggerated anatomical features, particularly on her head, which features a terrifying, elongated mouth with sharp teeth and white, vacant eyes. From her back and arms, several sharp, tendril-like appendages with pointed tips extend dramatically, contributing to her menacing silhouette. The character’s skin is smooth and iridescent, reflecting highlights of gold and silver from the environment. Her feet are bare and look metallic, merging seamlessly with the rest of her body.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic and cinematic, with a strong, bright, white light source coming from behind and slightly above her on the left, creating striking rim lighting and deep shadows. The foreground and background are dark, mostly in deep blacks and grays, but with subtle hints of warm, golden light reflecting off the shiny floor and scattered as small, luminous particles in the air, creating a rich atmosphere. The floor is also highly reflective, mirroring the character and the light sources. The texture is smooth and polished with golden veins or cracks running across its surface.\n\nThe composition is vertical, emphasizing the character's height and imposing presence. The overall mood is dark, mysterious, and powerful, with a touch of futuristic horror.\n\n**Key Visual Elements:**\n*   Female symbiote character (Venom/Carnage inspired)\n*   Sleek, highly reflective dark metallic/obsidian body\n*   Exaggerated, terrifying head with sharp teeth and white eyes\n*   Dramatic, sharp tendril-like appendages from back and arms\n*   Bare, metallic feet\n*   Dimly lit, futuristic/industrial setting\n*   Highly reflective floor with golden accents\n*   Scattered luminous particles in the air\n\n**Style:**\n*   3D Render / Digital Art\n*   Realistic but stylized, with an emphasis on texture and reflection\n*   Cinematic / Dark Sci-Fi\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Full body shot\n*   Vertical orientation\n*   Character centered, facing slightly right\n*   Low angle perspective, emphasizing character's height\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Dominant deep blacks, grays, and dark metallics\n*   Strong white light accents\n*   Warm golden reflections and scattered light particles\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Dramatic, high contrast\n*   Strong backlight from upper left, creating rim lighting\n*   Reflective surfaces prominently displaying light\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Menacing, powerful, mysterious\n*   Futuristic horror\n*   Slightly ominous yet visually striking",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Pulsing glow on suit's reflective surfaces (chest, limbs). Tendrils ripple and undulate. Reflective particles drift upwards. Floor gleam shifts and expands.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The reflective suit flares with blinding bursts of light across limbs and chest. The tendrils explode outwards violently, lashing and retracting with aggressive force. Volatile energy surges from the floor, erupting into a frenzy of shimmering particles that swirl intensely around her. The floor shatters into a cracking, spreading pattern of light, mirroring an accelerating, rapid camera zoom towards her.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Reverse gravity pulls luminous particles from the floor, swirling into intricate tendrils that phase through the suit, causing it to shimmer opalescently. The tendrils behind her elongate impossibly, twisting into Möbius strips, then retracting into her form, leaving echoes of light. The floor itself ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting impossible geometries.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**The Woman in Black Latex**\n\nA slow push-in reveals the woman's imposing figure, the camera tracing the subtle pulse of light on her suit. As we near, the tendrils behind her dramatically writhe and lash. A sudden, sweeping camera arc unveils the glinting particles rising from the floor like ephemeral spirits. The floor's gleam intensifies with a dramatic flair, reflecting her menacing visage as she slowly extends a clawed hand, beckoning.",
