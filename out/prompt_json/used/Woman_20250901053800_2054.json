    "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n\"Striking watercolor painting of a lone woman walking uphill through a sparse, snow-covered winter landscape. She wears a vibrant red beanie and a dramatically long, flowing red scarf that dissolves into abstract paint splatters, paired with a rust-colored quilted coat. Her face is in profile, contemplative. The ground is thick with white snow and deep blue-grey shadows, traversed by a winding path. Skeletal, gnarled trees with dark branches flank the scene under an overcast white/light blue sky. Executed in a loose watercolor style with bleeding colors, impressionistic detail, and prominent red and dark paint splatters. Skillful use of negative space for snow highlights. The vivid red acts as a powerful focal point, creating a poignant contrast against the cool whites, blues, and greys. Overall mood of solitude, contemplation, and resilient beauty.\""
