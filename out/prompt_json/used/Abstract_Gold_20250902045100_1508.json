  "video_prompt": "A luminous central golden sphere gently pulsates, its surface shimmering with dancing flecks. Liquid golden tendrils fluidly loop, twist, and swirl outwards, continuously reforming intricate patterns. Smaller golden spheres softly drift and rotate. Countless golden particles shimmer and drift like cosmic dust, subtly breaking apart and rejoining. A tiny blue light point occasionally twinkles. The deep dark background subtly undulates as dark, organic shapes slowly emerge and recede. A soft grey glow expands and contracts in the upper right, illuminating fleeting shadowy forms.",
  "image_prompt": "A highly detailed abstract cosmic composition, featuring opulent gold against a deep, velvety black background. A luminous, pearlescent gold central sphere radiates intricate, swirling liquid gold tendrils and ribbons. Scattered throughout are smaller reflective gold spheres, cosmic gold dust, and a subtle bright blue light point. The background reveals subtle undulating textures, dark organic shapes, and a soft grey glow. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting emphasizes golden elements glowing from within. Photorealistic abstraction, evoking luxury, cosmic wonder, and dynamic depth.",
