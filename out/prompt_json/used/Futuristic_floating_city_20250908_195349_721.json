    "video_prompt": "The immense orange sphere above subtly rotates, casting shifting shadows on the colossal rock formation. Miniature hot air balloons drift gently between the peaks. On the rock's edge, specks of people move and interact. The vibrant turquoise water below ripples and foams around the rocks, with two boats rocking gently on the current. The figure in the foreground subtly sways, his jacket imperceptibly rustling in a barely-there breeze. Tiny particles of dust or light motes drift in the air, especially noticeable around the sunlit areas of the rock.",
    "image_prompt": "A hyperrealistic and highly detailed wide shot of a futuristic canyon city, resembling a cyberpunk style but with a touch of fantasy. The central focus is a massive, multi-tiered rock formation, like a towering mesa or island, that has been organically integrated with structures on its ledges, creating a bustling, lived-in feel. \n\n**Visual elements:** The rock formation is a striking red-brown, with jagged cliffs and varying depths of shadow and light. The structures on its ledges are small and intricate, suggesting homes, shops, and pathways, with tiny figures visible, hinting at human activity. The water around the base is a vibrant, clear turquoise with white foamy waves, indicating motion. Several fantastical hot air balloons, shaped like elongated teardrops in muted orange and beige, float at various heights. In the distance, a large, serene moon or orbital body glows a soft white against a pale blue sky. Above, a colossal, reddish-orange spherical object, possibly a hovering city or planet, dominates the upper frame, connected to the rock formation by thin, barely visible lines. Other smaller, dark, angular flying vehicles or drones are scattered in the sky.\n\n**Composition:** The image uses a low-angle perspective, looking down from a high vantage point, placing the viewer as a solitary figure observing the scene. This figure, seen from behind, stands on a dark, industrial-looking platform, looking out over the expansive waters and the rock city. The towering rock formation creates a strong vertical element, anchoring the composition, while the horizontal expanse of the water and distant sky offers depth. The hot air balloons and flying objects add dynamic, asymmetrical elements to the sky.\n\n**Colors:** The palette is dominated by warm orange-reds of the rock, contrasted sharply with the cool, bright turquoise of the water. The sky transitions from a soft pale blue at the horizon to a deeper, more saturated blue closer to the orange sphere. Darker blues, greys, and black are used for the foreground platform, shadowed parts of the rock, and distant city structures, creating stark contrasts. The overall impression is vibrant and rich.\n\n**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in bright, clear daylight, casting long, dramatic shadows that highlight the texture and contours of the rock formation. The light suggests a late afternoon or early morning, with warm, directional rays catching the edges of the cliffs and structures. The water reflects the light, appearing luminous.\n\n**Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is one of awe, wonder, and a touch of solitude. The scale of the environment is immense, evoking a sense of human insignificance yet also resilience and adaptation. The presence of the lone figure gazing out reinforces a contemplative and exploratory mood. The blend of natural elements with futuristic structures and celestial bodies creates a unique, harmonious, and slightly melancholic science-fantasy tone.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The immense orange sphere subtly rotates, casting shifting shadows. Miniature hot air balloons drift. Specks of people move and interact at the rock's edge. Vibrant water ripples and foams, two boats gently rock. The foreground figure subtly sways, his jacket imperceptibly rustling. Tiny particles of dust or light motes drift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal orange sphere PULSES rapidly, violently tearing at the rock formation below, which CRACKS and SPLITS with explosive force! Hot air balloons WHIP erratically, some IGNITING in fiery bursts. The vibrant turquoise water ERUPTS, tidal waves SMASHING into the splintering rocks. Boats are TOSSED and SHREDDED. The figure in the foreground LEAPS, dodging debris as the cliff face COLLAPSES. Dust motes SWIRL into a roaring vortex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The colossal rock formation, now a vibrant coral, pulsates, shedding miniature islands that float upward. The immense orange sphere weeps liquid light, dissolving into a rainbow cascade. Hot air balloons unravel into shimmering jellyfish that swim against the sky, their tentacles dissolving into the luminous water below. Boats ripple into gaseous, phosphorescent forms, sailing on a time-reversed current. The figure stretches into a fractal tree, his jacket blossoming into bioluminescent flora. Dust motes become cosmic embryos, gestating new realities.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "CINEMATIC:  The camera dramatically pans up from the lone figure, revealing his subtle sway and the rustling jacket. It then swoops outward, showcasing the colossal rock formation illuminated by the immense, slowly rotating orange sphere, its shadows crawling across the surface. Hot air balloons dance delicately amidst the peaks. A rapid zoom-in on the chaotic bustle of people on the cliff edge before a breathtaking wide shot captures the vibrant turquoise water, the boats now noticeably rocking as waves crash dramatically, scattering dust motes that catch the golden light.",
