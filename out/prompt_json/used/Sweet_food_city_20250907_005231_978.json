    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the trees. Subtle ripples spread across the water surface, and the small boats drift slightly. The lights in the buildings flicker softly. Tiny dust motes dance in the sunlight.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A whimsical, hyperrealistic, and fantastical cityscape built from massive baked goods. In the foreground, a large, sunken bread bowl (similar to a bread pudding or a sweet bun with a cavity) filled with a swirling white cream forms a central island, surrounded by a calm, turquoise canal. Along the canal banks, miniature, detailed European-style canal houses with illuminated windows and awnings line cobblestone promenades. Tiny people are bustling about on the promenades, and small boats, some laden with round baked goods, float in the water.\n\nRising dramatically in the midground, a giant, vertically sliced loaf of white bread, revealing its porous texture, acts as a towering building. Funiculars or cable car systems extend from the bread's surface to stacks of large, golden-brown bagels, which are topped with vibrant green whipped cream (matcha or pistachio flavored) on the left, and plain brown bagels on the right. These bagel stacks form other large 'buildings' or natural formations in the background, receding into a light, airy sky with hints of a soft blue gradient.\n\nThe overall composition is an eye-level shot with a slight tilt, creating a miniature world effect. The lighting is bright and inviting, suggesting a daytime scene with warm artificial lights from the houses, creating a charming glow. The colors are rich and warm, dominated by various shades of brown and gold from the baked goods, complemented by the cool turquoise of the water and the pops of green cream and colorful house facades. The atmosphere is enchanting, surreal, and evokes a sense of delicious wonder and miniature urban life.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nBreeze-animated leaves sway. Water ripples subtly, boats drift. Building lights flicker. Dust motes dance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Looming bread slices violently twist, spewing forth molten lava. Bagel towers explosively erupt, launching green cream into the chaotic sky. Buildings violently convulse, their foundations cracking as giant cream cheese waves surge and crash. Miniature people scream, stampeding through crumbling streets, amidst a tempest of flying pretzels and rogue bagels. The entire edible metropolis violently implodes under the weight of an unseen, raging hunger.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A vibrant current pulls the boats *up* the canal walls, their contents spilling into the sky as miniature bagels float like balloons. The buildings, shrunken and expanded, breathe in and out with glowing windows, their roofs twisting into frosting swirls. Baguette-cliffs shimmer, their cable cars retracting into thin air, leaving glowing trails. Time fragments, making the water flow both ways, dissolving into sparkling dust.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera glides past towering bread loaves, revealing miniature gondolas ferrying golden pastries along a shimmering river. A sudden gust whips through the air, sending tiny figures on bridges reeling, while the lights in the whimsical pastry-buildings flicker wildly. The massive bread tower sways precariously, almost toppling, as the sky darkens, hinting at a coming storm.",
