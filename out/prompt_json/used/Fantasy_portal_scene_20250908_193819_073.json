    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze rustles the woman's hair and dress; the mist on the water's surface subtly shifts and dissipates. The water itself shows slight rippling, reflecting the sky. Within the large archway, the swirling light subtly pulsates and shifts, with faint twinkling of the stars. The single strong vertical light beam softly intensifies and diminishes. The clouds in the sky drift lazily.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   A young woman, seen from behind, wading barefoot in calm, reflective water. She wears a simple, flowing white or light-colored dress that trails in the water. Her long dark hair flows down her back.\n*   In the background, a massive, ornate, dark-colored archway or mirror frame stands tall, framing a surreal sky. The frame features intricate carvings and possibly gold accents.\n*   Through the archway, a vibrant, spiraling galaxy or cosmic vortex dominates the upper sky, emitting bright blue and purple light and sparkling stars.\n*   Below the cosmic spiral, a cloudy sunset sky with hues of orange, pink, and purple.\n*   A distant, tall, slender tower (resembling a medieval or fantasy spire) is visible through the clouds, illuminated by an ethereal light emanating vertically from below the galaxy.\n*   The archway is set within a dense, mystical forest with tall, dark trees framing either side, partially obscured by mist or fog at their bases.\n*   The foreground features dark, rocky banks on either side of the water, with some hints of greenery/moss.\n*   The water reflects the vibrant sky and the light from the setting sun, creating shimmering patterns.\n\n**Style & Composition:**\n*   **Style:** Fantasy art, ethereal, surreal, dreamlike, highly detailed, painterly, almost like a digital painting. Hint of classical romanticism mixed with cosmic fantasy.\n*   **Composition:** Rule of thirds applied, with the woman and the archway as key focal points. Strong vertical lines from the archway and trees, balanced by the horizontal expanse of the water and the horizon. The spiral draws the eye upwards, while the woman guides it into the scene. Symmetrical balance with the archway, yet dynamic with the woman's placement.\n*   **Perspective:** Low-angle shot from behind the woman, looking towards the archway and sunset.\n\n**Colors & Lighting:**\n*   **Color Palette:** Dominant cool tones (dark blues, deep greens, purples) in the forest and upper sky, contrasted with warm tones (oranges, pinks, golden yellows) in the sunset and water reflections. Bright, vivid magical blues and purples in the cosmic spiral.\n*   **Lighting:** Ethereal and magical light emanating from the cosmic spiral and the vertical beam above the tower. Warm, soft glow from the setting sun, creating rim lighting on the clouds and reflections on the water. The forest is dimly lit, almost silhouetted, enhancing the mystical atmosphere. Strong contrast between light and shadow.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Mysterious, awe-inspiring, spiritual, serene, adventurous, melancholic, sense of wonder, journey into the unknown. A quiet moment before a grand magical event.\n\n**Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n```\nA full shot of a young woman from behind, in a flowing white dress, wading barefoot through calm, reflective water. She faces a majestic, ornately carved, dark wooden archway, resembling a grand portal, standing tall in the distance. Through the archway, a vibrant, glowing purple and blue cosmic spiral galaxy fills the upper sky, emitting bright starlight. Below the galaxy, a breathtaking sunset illuminates the sky with soft orange, pink, and purple clouds. A slender, gothic-style tower spire rises dimly through the distant clouds, with an ethereal light beam emanating upwards from it towards the galaxy. The archway is framed by dark, gnarled trees of a mystical forest on either side. Misty fog rolls over the dark, rocky banks that frame the water in the foreground. The water perfectly mirrors the celestial light and sunset colors. Fantasy art, ultra detailed, surreal, dreamlike, painterly. Ethereal lighting, high contrast, mystical atmosphere.\n```",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The woman's hair and dress subtly sway. Mist dissipates across the water's rippling surface, reflecting the drifting clouds and shifting sky. Inside the archway, light swirls and twinkles, while a vertical beam softly pulses.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal archway violently shatters, its ornate frame exploding into shards. The serene water boils and erupts, geysers rocketing towards the sky, while the mist twists into furious vortices. Stars hurtle outwards like fiery projectiles, and the central cosmic spiral violently distorts, contorting into a vortex. The vertical light beam pulses with blinding, explosive intensity, causing the very clouds to tear apart as the distant tower dramatically collapses into the chaos. The woman is ripped backward by an unseen force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The colossal archway subtly warps into a kaleidoscope of melting colors, its ornate frame dissolving into ethereal mist swirling with luminous cosmic dust. The water below defies gravity, cascading upwards in shimmering rivulets that coalesce into liquid constellations. From the swirling void within the arch, phantom whispers of ancient languages intertwine with the sound of a thousand blossoming flowers, while the distant tower momentarily morphs into a giant, pulsating heart, beating in sync with the cosmic hum.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A long shot reveals the woman approaching a shimmering portal. As she steps into the water, a dramatic camera pan follows her, capturing the swirling celestial light intensifying within the archway. A slow, cinematic zoom-in highlights her flowing dress as she walks towards the pulsating light. The mist on the water swirls dramatically around her, stirred by an unseen force. Simultaneously, the sky darkens, and the single vertical beam of light widens, inviting her onward.",
