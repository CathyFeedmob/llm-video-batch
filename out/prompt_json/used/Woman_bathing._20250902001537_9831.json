  "video_prompt": "A young East Asian woman, submerged in an outdoor bath, maintains a calm, contemplative expression, with subtle shifts in her gaze or a slow blink. Gentle ripples continuously disturb the water's surface, reflecting the flickering flames of nearby candlelight. The soft, warm light casts shifting highlights and shadows across her face and shoulders. In the out-of-focus background, dark foliage gently sways.",
  "image_prompt": "A young East Asian woman bathing in an outdoor wooden onsen at night. She has dark hair in a soft, messy bun with wispy bangs, and a calm, contemplative expression, gazing thoughtfully. Her delicate features and fair skin are softly lit by the warm, orange-yellow glow of flickering candlelight from glass lanterns, one on a wooden ledge beside her. Submerged to her shoulders, a light-colored towel loosely covers her chest. The water is a soft greenish-blue with gentle ripples. In the blurry background, natural stones, dark green foliage, and trees create a secluded, lush environment. The overall mood is serene, tranquil, intimate, and deeply peaceful.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle shifts in her gaze, punctuated by a slow blink, animate her contemplative expression. Gentle ripples continuously disturb the water's surface, reflecting the flickering dance of nearby candlelight. This shifting light creates dynamic highlights and shadows across her face and shoulders. In the out-of-focus background, dark foliage gently sways."
