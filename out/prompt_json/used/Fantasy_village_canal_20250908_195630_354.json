    "video_prompt": "Gentle light ray shimmering around the moon and stars, soft flickering of the external lanterns, subtle mist tracing up the mountains, faint glow from distant windows, rippling water surface reflecting the lights.",
    "image_prompt": "A magical, fantasy village nestled in a canyon, with a river flowing through its center, illuminated by warm, glowing lights from the buildings. The sky is a mystical dark blue, filled with sparkling stars, a prominent crescent moon, and a full moon beside it, surrounded by ethereal clouds. Majestic, snow-capped mountains loom in the background, contrasting with the soft glow of the celestial objects. The buildings are quaint and historic, with intricate details on their roofs and facades, each window radiating light, and lanterns hanging outside their entrances. Lush greenery and flowered pots line the cobblestone path beside the river, where small boats gently rest on the water's shimmering surface, reflecting the lights from the village and the stars above. The overall impression is one of enchanting tranquility and wonder.\n\n**Art Styles**: Fantasy art, Magical realism, Atmospheric, Detailed illustration\n\n**Camera Shot**: Eye-level, Medium shot, inviting the viewer into the scene.\n\n**Composition**: The river acts as a leading line, drawing the eye through the village. The prominent elements are balanced, with the village and river dominating the lower half and the celestial sky and mountains completing the upper half.\n\n**Lighting**: Warm and inviting, with numerous light sources from the buildings and lanterns creating a cozy glow. The reflections in the water add depth and magic. The celestial bodies illuminate the night sky with a soft, ethereal light.\n\n**Colors**: Predominantly dark blues and purples in the sky, contrasted with warm oranges and yellows from the lights. Greens from the vegetation and browns from the building structures add natural tones. The water reflects a blend of these colors.\n\n**Atmosphere**: Dreamy, serene, enchanting, magical, peaceful, fantastical.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Light rays shimmer around celestial bodies. External lanterns softly flicker. Mist subtly traces mountains. Distant windows faintly glow. Water surfaces ripple, reflecting the lights.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Moon and stars violently pulse with brilliant light, lanterns explode in a shower of sparks, fierce wind whips mist into a raging vortex around mountains. Distant windows burst with blinding flashes. The river churns wildly, water spouting upwards, reflecting chaotic, dancing fire, and boats are tossed by the raging current!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Moon fragments gently detach, floating like reverse snow, while gravity pulls the buildings slightly upwards. Lantern lights coalesce into swirling ethereal beings dancing above the water, which flows upward into the mist. Mountains gently twist and distort like taffy, and their reflections shatter into stardust on the inverse gravity river. Boats become constellations that flicker and dissolve.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic Shot:**\n\nThe camera *slowly tracks left*, revealing the full moon and a shimmering crescent, illuminating a mountain castle. *It then swoops down and forward*, gliding through an ancient archway, revealing a vibrant village canal. Soft light from windows *flickers into the water*, creating ethereal reflections. A single, empty boat *gently drifts into view*, its silhouette a haunting presence against the glowing ripples. The camera *dramatically pulls back*, overlooking the entire enchanting, star-kissed scene.",
