  "video_prompt": "A dynamic console's displays shift intricate schematics, status indicators illuminate, and buttons depress, triggering changes. Modular sections reconfigure, wires subtly thrum, and a large dial rotates. Handwritten annotations appear, disappear, and re-arrange around evolving technical sketches and schematics.",
  "image_prompt": "Create a detailed engineering sketch of a futuristic console, blending precise technical illustration with freehand elements. Use black ink on white, with accents of orange, green, and blue for displays and indicators. The console features a prominent central display with intricate schematics, surrounded by smaller readouts. Incorporate numerous buttons, switches, and dials of various sizes (some large, orange/gray). Show modular sections, visible wires, and a large, round, gray/orange component on the left. Include handwritten annotations with labels like \"DELize,\" \"Jautr,\" \"Lannier,\" \"BATYOIVE,\" and \"PAL,\" along with detailed technical sketches and a smaller schematic drawing of an internal mechanism or circuit. Emphasize an ongoing design process.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Console displays dynamically shift, revealing evolving schematics and illuminating status indicators. Buttons depress, triggering modular sections to reconfigure. Wires subtly thrum as a large dial continuously rotates. Handwritten annotations appear, vanish, and re-position around the morphing technical drawings."
