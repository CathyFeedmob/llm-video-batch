  "video_prompt": "**Person walks slowly down an infinitely reflective, mirrored hallway. Their single movement multiplies into countless reflections, rippling across floor, ceiling, and walls. Subtle color gradients shift and flow across the reflective surfaces as they advance, with scattered lights appearing and disappearing with each step.** \n",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A person's slow, advancing steps trigger a cascade of multiplying reflections, rippling and spreading across the floor, ceiling, and walls. As they move, dynamic color gradients flow and morph across these reflective surfaces. Scattered points of light constantly appear and vanish, synchronized with each deliberate footfall."
