Digital visualizations, including binary code, bar graphs, pie charts, and text, continuously refresh, analyze, and display new data. Light reflects and refracts off the evolving AR elements, emanating a soft glow that subtly shifts the dark, blurred background.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:**\n\nClose-up, eye-level digital artwork of a woman wearing futuristic, transparent AR glasses with translucent blue tint. Her blue eye is visible, gazing slightly right. The glasses are filled with vibrant data visualizations: \"Anaklyzing\" text, binary code, bar and line graphs, multi-colored pie charts, \"data input\", and circular dials, with a soft glow. Dark, blurred background. Highly detailed, realistic style.",
