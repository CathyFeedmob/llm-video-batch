    "video_prompt": "The robotic gorilla breathes subtly, the chest plates gently rising and falling with a soft internal glow. The blue lights on its armor gently pulse and flicker with a low, rhythmic hum. The antenna on its head subtly vibrates. A very subtle camera push-in and slow pan upward accentuates its imposing stance.",
    "image_prompt": "Full-body shot of a powerful, futuristic cyborg gorilla standing upright, facing forward, with an intense expression. The cyborg features highly detailed, metallic silver and dark grey plating with visible hydraulic components and intricate wiring. Bright blue glowing accents emanate from various parts of its body, including its chest, arms, shoulders, and legs, and its eyes glow fiercely blue. The background is a clean, dark grey studio environment with faint grid lines and subtle light reflections, enhancing the sci-fi aesthetic. The lighting is strong from the front, creating reflections on the metallic surfaces. The overall composition is imposing and heroic. A white logo, \"C29,\" with a grey outline and a small signature, is in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movement & Alterations:**\n\nA robotic gorilla breathes, its chest plates rising and falling with a soft internal glow. Blue armor lights pulse rhythmically. Its antennae vibrate. The camera subtly pushes in and pans upward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The robotic gorilla's chest explodes outward, armor plates morphing into razor-sharp blades that violently rip through the air. Blinding blue energy arcs wildly from its body, causing the ground to fissure and shatter beneath its pounding metallic feet. Its eyes flare with aggressive intent as its arms lash out, tearing nonexistent obstacles apart. Its antenna whips wildly, sending chaotic energy bursts into the environment, distorting space around it.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robotic gorilla, comprised of liquid mercury, ripples as cosmic dust rains upward. Its chest plates morph into swirling galaxies, exhaling constellations, while the blue lights liquify, forming shimmering rivers that flow impossibly into the sky. Its antenna unravels into a gossamer thread, weaving itself into the fabric of spacetime, as the very ground elevates, becoming a floating island, ascending towards an unseen celestial body.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic push-in reveals the robotic gorilla. As the camera subtly arcs upward, its chest plates rise and fall, the soft internal glow intensifying with each breath. The blue lights on its imposing armor pulse, reflecting off the metallic surface as the camera pans closer, revealing the subtle vibrations of its antenna. A low, rhythmic hum accompanies the scene, building tension.",
