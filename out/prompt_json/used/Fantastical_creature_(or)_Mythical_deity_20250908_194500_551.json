    "video_prompt": "From the central entity, soft ethereal light pulsates gently, and its many delicate tendrils sway and curl subtly. The three suspended spheres and any small hanging ornaments softly oscillate. The large tree-like antlers subtly quiver, and the smaller leaves and flowers in the foreground faintly rustle. Water from the fountain ripples and splashes in tiny bursts, with subtle light reflections dancing on its surface. Small, scattered particles of light drift upwards from the fountain and throughout the dark background. The two small flying creatures in the background subtly flutter their wings, and a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom in on the central entity could add depth.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, stylized depiction of a fantastic scene on a dark background. At the top, a large, intricate, organic-looking structure with branches resembling antlers extends upwards. Below this, a central, highly ornate, monstrous head, possibly a deity or mythical creature, dominates the mid-ground. The head is primarily teal/blue with golden accents and features prominent, light purple, fleshy ears. Its eyes are dark, and its mouth is exaggerated with sharp teeth and long, trailing, pink and gold tentacle-like elements extending downwards.\n\nA glowing, circular, golden mechanical element resembling a compass or sundial is embedded in the creature's forehead. Surrounding the creature are various floating spheres and abstract forms, possibly celestial bodies or decorative orbs, some light blue, one yellow/gold. Thin, light blue and purple lines (possibly light trails or energy streams) arc and curve across the dark background.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, the scene opens to a lush, fantastical garden with large, detailed pink roses, smaller yellow and blue flowers, and fluffy, grey, cloud-like formations. A light blue, spiky, plant-like structure emerges from a circular pool or fountain at the very bottom center, with water rippling outwards. Small, ethereal creatures or birds with flowing wings are visible flying amidst the scene. The overall style is illustrative and highly detailed, with a rich color palette and a sense of otherworldly wonder.\n\n**Art Style:** Stylized illustration, neo-traditional tattoo style, whimsical fantasy art, highly detailed.\n**Colors:** Deep black background, vibrant teal, golden yellow, pink, light purple, sky blue, grey.\n**Lighting:** Soft glow emanating from the central golden element and water feature, scattered light points.\n**Composition:** Symmetrical yet dynamic, strong focal point on the central creature, leading lines from the antlers and trailing elements.\n**Atmosphere:** Mythical, ethereal, enigmatic, fantastical.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Gentle pulsation of soft ethereal light from the central entity, its delicate tendrils subtly swaying and curling. Suspended spheres and small ornaments softly oscillate. Tree-like antlers quiver, and foreground leaves faintly rustle. Fountain water ripples and micro-splashes, with dancing light reflections. Scattered light particles drift upward from the fountain and background. Two small flying creatures subtly flutter wings. Very slow, imperceptible zoom-in on the entity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "From the central entity, sudden bursts of blinding light erupt, sending its tendrils whipping violently. The suspended spheres and ornaments unpredictably collide and swing wildly. The tree-like antlers aggressively jolt and twist. The leaves and flowers in the foreground thrashes violently. Water in the fountain suddenly surges upwards, then explodes outwards into sharp, chaotic shards. Large, luminous particles aggressively shoot across the dark background. The flying creatures dart and weave erratically, and the camera rapidly zooms in and out, creating disorienting, intense flashes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "From the central entity, soft ethereal light pulsates, causing its tendrils to materialize and dematerialize into light. The suspended spheres defy gravity, orbiting the entity and merging into glowing rings. Tree-like antlers morph into crystalline structures, shedding shimmering dust that transforms foreground flowers into floating iridescent bubbles. The fountain water flows upwards, solidifying into a luminous, skeletal hand reaching for the entity, as reality itself ripples and folds, twisting the background into an impossible, kaleidoscopic vortex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Dramatic Cinematic Prompt:**\n\n**(0:00-0:02) Establishing Shot:** A wide, slow pan across the enchanted garden, focus on the luminescent fountain, its water subtly rippling, golden light scattering upwards.\n\n**(0:02-0:04) Slow Zoom In:** The camera gracefully glides forwards, drawing nearer to the ominous, yet captivating central entity.\n\n**(0:04-0:06) Close-Up:** As the camera approaches, the entityâ€™s tree-like antlers quiver, and its delicate tendrils sway and curl with increased intensity. The suspended spheres begin to spin slowly, catching the light.\n\n**(0:06-0:08) Dynamic Movement:** The ground blossoms surge, blooming vigorously, their petals gently unfurling. The two flying creatures dart playfully, encircling the entity.\n\n**(0:08-0:10) Final Reveal:** A sudden, slow pulse emanates from the entity, as ethereal light washes over the entire scene, concluding in a single, mesmerizing glow.",
