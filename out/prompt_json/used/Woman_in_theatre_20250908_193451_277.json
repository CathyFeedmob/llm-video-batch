    "video_prompt": "Camera slowly pans forward, following the woman ascending the steps. Rose petals gently drift downwards from above. The luminous beam in the distance subtly pulses with light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA surreal and dreamlike, full-shot cinematic portrait from behind, depicting a slender young woman with short, dark hair in a light-colored, flowing dress and high heels, ascending a wide, grand staircase within an opulent, empty theater. The theater seats are a vibrant crimson red, arranged in long, curving rows that ascend gently on either side of the staircase. The stairs themselves are carpeted in matching red, with blue-gray steps and railing accents. Scattered red rose petals litter the red carpeted stairs and appear to be floating or gently falling from above in the dimly lit, expansive upper portion of the theater. Two ornate, wall-mounted lamps with red shades cast warm, localized light on the side walls.\n\nThe upper section of the theater, particularly the elevated stage or screen area in the distance, is bathed in a dramatic, ethereal, vertical beam of glowing cyan-blue light that pierces through the darkness and illuminates the falling petals. The overall lighting is dim and mysterious, with strong contrast between the dark blues/grays and the vibrant reds and cyan light. The atmosphere is melancholic and introspective, yet visually striking. The style is highly detailed digital painting with a painterly texture, reminiscent of fantasy art.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Young woman (slender, short dark hair, light dress, high heels), viewed from behind, ascending stairs.\n*   **Setting:** Grand, opulent, empty theater.\n*   **Key Objects:** Vibrant crimson red theater seats, wide grand staircase, red carpet, blue-gray stair accents/railings, wall-mounted lamps with red shades, scattered red rose petals.\n*   **Lighting:** Dim and mysterious overall. Dramatic, ethereal vertical beam of glowing cyan-blue light in the distance (likely from the screen/stage area). Warm, localized light from side lamps. Strong contrast.\n*   **Colors:** Dominant vivid crimson red (seats, carpet, petals), deep blues and grays (walls, shadowed areas, stair accents), bright cyan-blue (light beam).\n*   **Atmosphere/Mood:** Surreal, dreamlike, cinematic, melancholic, introspective, mysterious, visually striking.\n*   **Composition:** Full shot, low-angle perspective looking up towards the ascending woman and the dramatic light beyond. Strong leading lines from the seats and stairs pulling the eye towards the central light.\n*   **Style:** Digital painting, highly detailed, painterly texture, fantasy art aesthetic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refined Prompt:\n\nCamera tracking woman's ascent. Petals fall past her. Distant light pulsates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Camera RUSHES forward, an INFERNO of rose petals WHIRLING violently around the woman as she LEAPS up the stairs. The distant beam EXPLODES with light, pulsating like a STORM. Red velvet seats SHUDDER and writhe, as if ALIVE, reaching and grasping.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "As the woman steps up, a luminous ripple in the red carpet causes her previous footprints to glow and lift, forming a celestial stairway behind her. Each ascending petal transforms into a shimmering butterfly, flying backward and fusing into a liquid beam of light that then flows upwards into the ceiling. The theater seats behind her morph into a swirling vortex of crimson mist.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The grand theatre is bathed in twilight, rose petals scattering like crimson snow. A sole figure, illuminated by a pulsating central beam, ascends the red-carpeted steps. The camera, low and sweeping, echoes her determined gait, the light subtly intensifying as she nears the unknown. The petals swirl, catching the light, an ethereal dance of past and future.",
