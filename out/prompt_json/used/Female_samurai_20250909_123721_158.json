    "video_prompt": "Subtle sway of hair and ponytail, gentle shift in her stance, faint glow on the katana blade, distant embers flickering in the background, light breeze rustling the red flowers.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nLong shot of an elegant female warrior, seen from behind turned over her right shoulder, looking to the left. She has long, dark flowing hair tied in a high ponytail with a red ribbon, and a piercing gaze. Intricate green and red dragon tattoos cover her back and right shoulder/arm. She wears a dark, flowing outfit with ornate golden and red accents, and a samurai sword (katana) is sheathed at her hip, with another katana positioned diagonally behind her back, blade subtly glowing blue. The setting is an ancient, ruined temple or overgrown structure at twilight. Large, dark stone columns and crumbling steps visible, draped with branches of red blooming flowers (like cherry blossoms or camellias). The atmosphere is moody and slightly mystical, with a dark teal and muted green color palette dominant in the background sky and stone, contrasting with the vibrant red blossoms and hints of warm light. Subtle glowing bokeh lights in the distant background. Dynamic composition, high detail, volumetric lighting, epic fantasy art.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle hair and ponytail sway, her stance gently shifting. Katana blade's faint glow, distant embers flickering. Light breeze rustles red flowers.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Hair whips violently, ponytail unravels, her body shifts aggressively, katana blade glows intensely, casting sharp reflections. Wind howls, ripping through the ruin, sending debris and red petals spiraling into a chaotic vortex. Nearby statues crack and reassemble, their ancient forms morphing with explosive energy. The ground trembles, dust clouds erupting around her, as the very structure of the ruin contorts and shifts beneath her feet.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The katana blade morphs into drifting constellations, its light drawing the flowers upwards into blooming, crimson galaxies. Her ponytail unravels into a vortex of ink, pulling her silhouette into the stone pillars, which ripple like water. The distant embers reverse, spiraling inward, reshaping the sky into a shattered mirror. Her tattoos become living dragons, shedding their scales into a cascade of glowing petals that fall upwards, defying gravity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic push-in on her face, revealing a slight, determined smirk. The camera then gracefully arcs around her, highlighting the swirling dragon tattoos and the katana's bright gleam as her hand subtly tightens around the hilt. As she turns, the red flowers gently sway, catching a fleeting, eerie glow of embers from the crumbling ruins behind her, hinting at a past battle or an impending one.",
