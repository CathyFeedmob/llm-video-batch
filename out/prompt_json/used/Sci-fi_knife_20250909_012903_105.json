    "video_prompt": "A very subtle camera push-in, with a slight gleam of light shifting across the metal and gold surfaces of the knife, highlighting its internal mechanisms. The lines on the blueprint in the background subtly shift, as if redrawing or being sketched in real time.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nHighly detailed, close-up shot of a futuristic, steampunk-inspired tactical knife, designed with intricate internal mechanical components exposed. The knife features a two-tone color scheme of dark matte grey and polished gold accents, appearing both rugged and elegant. The handle has visible screws and textured grip sections, with more gold highlights. The blade is partially cut away to reveal a complex internal mechanism, including gears, springs, pistons, and finely machined metallic parts in silver and gold tones. The design suggests a blend of industrial engineering and functional art, showcasing a sophisticated internal structure.\n\nThe knife is resting on a background resembling engineering blueprints or technical drawings, with faint, partially visible outlines of other knife designs, mechanical parts, and numerical annotations (e.g., \"32K\", \"O2K\"). A hand-drawn, cursive \"c29\" is prominently visible in the bottom right corner. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the metallic textures and the depth of the internal mechanisms, with subtle reflections on the polished gold surfaces. The overall aesthetic is clean, precise, and highly technical.\n\n**Art Style:** Technical illustration, high-fidelity 3D render, concept art, industrial design.\n**Colors:** Dark grey, polished gold, silver, metallic bronze.\n**Lighting:** Studio lighting, soft shadows, sharp details, good contrast.\n**Composition:** Top-down, slightly angled view, filling the frame with the knife as the primary subject, with the blueprint background providing context and depth without distracting from the main object.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom-in. Light playfully dances across the knife's metal and gold, revealing its intricate inner workings. Background blueprints are dynamically redrawing, lines appearing and dissolving with an organic, sketching motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive, high-speed camera thrusts into the knife, detonating light particles off its metal and gold chassis, revealing a surge of internal mechanisms. The blueprint's lines dramatically lurch and redraw themselves with violent, kinetic energy as if ripped from another dimension, while the entire object vibrates with unleashed power.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The knife's internal mechanisms spontaneously assemble, then begin weaving shimmering threads of light that pull the blueprint lines into impossible, spiraling patterns. The metal and gold surfaces pulsate with an inner luminescence, melting and reshaping into liquid forms before reforming, each gleam echoing a discordant chime as gravity momentarily reverses, lifting the blade slightly before it resettles, leaving behind an afterimage that blurs known reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, deliberate push-in, the camera tracking a gleaming arc of light as it glides across the knife's intricate, golden internal gears. As the light reveals the hidden mechanisms, the blueprint lines in the background begin to subtly redraw themselves with an ethereal glow, like spectral hands sketching the design in real-time. The camera then executes a dramatic, sweeping crane shot upward, briefly silhouetting the knife against a stark, theatrical spotlight, before finally settling on a sharp focus of the knife's hilt.",
