    "video_prompt": "Aerial view of a city after a massive explosion:\n- The mushroom cloud slightly expands and dissipates at its edges.\n- Debris and smoke drift and swirl around the base of the mushroom cloud and over the devastated city.\n- Subtle tremors resonate through the ground, causing slight shaking in the damaged buildings.\n- Water in the bay shows gentle ripples.\n- Small flickers of fire appear within the burning areas and subtly diminish.\n- Fine dust particles slowly settle through the air.",
    "image_prompt": "An aerial, wide-angle shot of a catastrophic nuclear explosion over a sprawling modern city by a large body of water, possibly a bay or river. A massive, mushroom-shaped cloud of dark grey smoke with orange and red glowing embers at its base rises from the ground zero, where buildings are entirely pulverized and a fiery explosion spreads outward. The surrounding city shows extensive damage, with many buildings in ruins and debris scattered everywhere. The water nearby also shows signs of the blast's impact. The sky is a light, hazy blue, with some darker clouds near the mushroom cloud. The overall atmosphere is one of immense destruction and devastation. The scene is somewhat desaturated in color, emphasizing the grim reality. In the bottom right corner, a stylized white text reads \"C29\". In the upper left corner, there's a small white box with Chinese characters.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "- Mushroom cloud pulsates and recedes.\n- Debris and smoke billow and eddy above the city.\n- Ground trembles, buildings subtly sway.\n- Bay water gently undulates.\n- Fires flicker and dwindle.\n- Dust motes drift and settle.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Aerial view of a city after a massive explosion:\nThe mushroom cloud dramatically expands and contorts, fireballs erupting within. Debris launches outward, buildings violently contort and collapse. The bay water surges and crashes, then begins to slowly drain. Flames rage and dance wildly, consuming structures in dynamic bursts, while smoke roils and whips around like a living entity. Sparks flash and ascend rapidly, forming trails.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "From the shattered city, buildings slowly ascend, reassembling into impossible geometries. The mushroom cloud inverts, drawing debris and smoke back into its fiery core, shrinking until it compresses into a radiant, pulsating sphere. Water in the bay surges skyward, forming ethereal, shimmering structures that defy gravity, as time flows backward in a shimmering, liquefied dance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping aerial shot reveals a city ravaged by a massive explosion, the mushroom cloud billowing ominously. The camera dramatically zooms in on the ruins, debris swirling, as subtle tremors shake the damaged structures. A sudden fiery burst erupts, then flickers and wanes, casting eerie shadows. The camera descends, capturing gentle ripples in the bay, before panning slowly across the desolation as fine dust settles, leaving a haunting silence.",
