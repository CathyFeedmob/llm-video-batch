    "video_prompt": "Subtle swirling and accretion of the lower planetary disc, gentle twinkling of distant stars, gradual outward expansion and dimming of the upper blue atmospheric glow, with sparse small meteoroids slowly drifting across the stellar background.",
    "image_prompt": "A breathtaking cosmic scene, depicting two massive celestial bodies, possibly planets or gas giants, partially visible. The upper body is an arc of a vibrant blue planet, highly detailed, showing faint lights like cities on its surface and dark patches of land or water. Its atmosphere glows brightly along its edge, fading into the deep space. The lower body is a swirling blue and white vortex, resembling a hurricane or a galactic spiral, with a bright, energetic core from which ethereal blue gas or light erupts upwards towards the upper celestial body.\n\nNumerous asteroids and debris are scattered across the image, some in the foreground and some further back, appearing dark and irregularly shaped against the cosmic backdrop. The space between the two large celestial bodies is filled with a dark blue and black expanse dotted with countless small, bright stars and wisps of luminous blue nebula gas, particularly concentrated as a stream flowing from the lower vortex towards the upper body. The overall color palette is dominated by deep blues, blacks, and electric blues, with accents of bright white and subtle golden light from the distant stars and surface lights.\n\nThe lighting creates a sense of immense scale, with the edges of the celestial bodies glowing intensely against the dark void. The atmosphere is awe-inspiring and fantastical, evoking a sense of wonder and cosmic drama. The composition places the two main celestial elements diagonally, creating dynamic movement and depth. A small, faint white text box in the top left corner reads \"AI生成\" (AI Generated), and larger white text in the bottom right corner reads \"艺术 演绎\" (Art Interpretation) above \"C29\".",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Lower disk violently rips apart, spewing luminous debris. Upper blue glow collapses inward, intensifying to a blinding flash. Distant stars explode into brilliant supernovas. Meteoroids aggressively collide, shattering into dazzling fragments as a cosmic storm rages!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Upper atmosphere, a celestial serpent of impossible blue light, rhythmically inhales distant stars, shrinking and brightening. Below, the planetary disc unravels counter-clockwise, its \"meteoroids\" transforming into shimmering fish that swim against invisible currents, their scales reflecting impossible hues. The entire scene pulsates, then inverts, light becoming shadow, space becoming solid.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly spirals inwards, following the subtle swirling of the lower planetary disc, revealing a massive black hole forming at its center, sucking in distant stars with dramatic, unexpected light surges. The upper blue atmospheric glow pulsates, then intensely collapses as small meteoroids are violently pulled into the abyss. The camera finally gets consumed into the deep, dark matter of the created black hole.",
