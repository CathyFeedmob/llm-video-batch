  "video_prompt": "The faceted bird statue's colors shift and sparkle as light changes. Its mirrored reflection warps and reforms on the glossy surface. Subtle movement from a distant light source causes dynamic color refractions across its body.",
  "image_prompt": "Vibrant, full shot of a faceted, jewel-toned bird statue with reflective surfaces. Angled body (left), head turned right. Body transitions from green/blue on top to purple/pink/orange on belly. Black beak and eyes. Stands on textured gold claw-like legs. Bright right-side lighting creates reflections and shadows. Pure white, glossy reflective surface below with a clear, slightly distorted mirror image. Minimalist pure white background. Subtle \"c29\" watermark in bottom right.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Colors vividly shift and sparkle across the faceted bird's form, constantly evolving. Its mirrored reflection dynamically warps and reforms on the glossy surface below. A distant light source subtly moves, casting ever-changing color refractions that cause its facets to continuously shimmer and transform."
