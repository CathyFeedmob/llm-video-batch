    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmering of stars and moons. Gentle rising and falling of shoulder, simulating breathing. Faint glow fluctuations around celestial bodies. Slight swaying of the flowers. Gradual dripping of the watery/paint effect downwards.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA feminine silhouette in profile, facing right, with her head slightly tilted up and eyes closed or downcast. Her hair is black and appears to burst or splatter outward from the back of her head. Inside the silhouette, a starry night sky with numerous small speckle-like stars and a few prominent, bright, starburst-shaped stars. Two large, detailed full moons are present within the silhouette, one higher and smaller, the other lower and larger, both glowing. Below the silhouette, a dense cluster of various sized flowers with visible petals and centers (likely asters or similar), forming a lush base.\n\n**Style:**\nPainterly, with elements of abstract expressionism (splatter effects) combined with realistic rendering of the moons and flowers. The overall aesthetic is ethereal, celestial, and dreamlike. There is a strong sense of texture, particularly from the paint splatters and the detailed flowers.\n\n**Composition:**\nVertical orientation. The woman's silhouette occupies the upper two-thirds, centered horizontally. The flowers form a band across the bottom, acting as a base. The background is split vertically, with the left side showing ink splatters and a gradient of colors, and the right side being a solid, muted light color. The silhouette sharply divides the inner cosmic scene from the outer abstract background.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Silhouette Interior:** Deep blues, purples, and indigo for the night sky, vibrant yellow/gold for the stars and moon glow.\n*   **Flowers:** A range of purples, lavenders, mauves, pinks, and some peachy/orange tones, with greens for foliage. The colors are rich and slightly desaturated, with a warm glow from below.\n*   **Background (General):** Muted light grey/white on the right.\n*   **Left Background:** Top part is light grey/white with black/dark blue paint splatters. Mid-bottom transitions into warm orange, peach, and reddish tones, seemingly emanating from behind the flowers, with corresponding ink splatters in similar colors. The very bottom left has cool blue/dark purple ink splatters and vertical drips.\n\n**Lighting:**\nThe primary light source for the stars and moons is internal to the silhouette, creating glowing effects. There's a strong, golden-orange glow emanating from the horizon line within the silhouette, casting a warm light upwards onto the lower moon and the upper parts of the flowers. This glow also affects the left background with warm hues. The overall lighting has a soft, diffused quality, highlighting the luminosity of the cosmic elements.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nMystical, contemplative, profound, and artistic. It evokes feelings of inner worlds, dreams, and the connection between nature and the cosmos. There's a sense of introspective beauty and a subtle emotional depth.\n\n**Overall Prompt:**\n\"A captivating vertical painting featuring the silhouette of a woman in profile, facing right, head slightly raised, eyes serene. Her black hair splatters and bursts into abstract ink forms on the light grey background. Inside her silhouette, a cosmic scene unfolds: a deep indigo and purple starry night sky filled with countless speckle stars and several prominent, bright gold starbursts. Two detailed, glowing full moons, one smaller and higher, one larger and lower, illuminate the celestial expanse within her form. Below her, a lush mound of densely packed flowers in shades of lavender, purple, pink, and muted peach emerge, bathed in a warm, golden-orange glow that emanates from a distant horizon line. The background on the right is a solid, clean light grey. The left background features fluid paint splatters and drips; black/dark blue at the top, transitioning to warm orange and reddish hues in the middle, and cool blues/dark purples at the bottom, creating an expressive abstract counterpoint to the silhouette. The overall style is a blend of ethereal realism and abstract expressionism, with soft, atmospheric lighting emphasizing the glowing celestial elements and the rich textures of the flowers and paint.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle celestial shimmers; gentle, rhythmic breathing; faint, pulsing glows; delicate floral sway; gradual, downward liquid flow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Moon explode into stardust, showering woman's silhouette. Her hair whips violently, stars in her body ignite fiercely. Flowers below abruptly blossom, then wither, petals flying upward. Paint splatters aggressively, forming a tidal wave before receding instantly. Intense, chaotic energy surges through every element.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Stars and moons inside the silhouette expand and contract, defying light. Ink splatters reverse, pooling back into the figure, while flowers twist into metallic forms. The \"C29\" bursts into golden dust, reforming in impossible locations. Gravity reverses for water drips, pulling them skyward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "As her silhouette emerges, a dramatic zoom reveals the celestial dance within: stars shimmer intensely, a full moon expands then contracts, its ethereal glow pulsing. Her shoulders rise and fall with an almost imperceptible breath, while the painted \"hair\" splashes outwards, creating a wave of stardust. Below, a dramatic color shift illuminates the flowers, which subtly sway, shedding droplets as if weeping liquid light. The final drop slides down, revealing \"c29.\"",
