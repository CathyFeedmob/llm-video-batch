    "video_prompt": "The translucent segments of the robotic hand subtly glow and dim in a sequence, suggesting power flow. The blue light within the lower display flickers gently, and the gears visibly but subtly grind and rotate as if in very slow motion. Thin, faint wisps of digital energy subtly emanate from the green circuit board.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, transparent robotic hand, rendered in a futuristic, x-ray style. The hand is shown in an open palm pose, revealing intricate internal mechanisms like gears, wires in blue, red, and yellow, and piston-like finger joints. Two glowing holographic screens overlay the palm and wrist area: one is green with a visible microchip graphic, and the other is light blue with abstract circuit patterns. The background is a stark black, contrasting with the luminous, cool-toned (blues, silvers, white) robotic elements. The lighting emphasizes the transparency and internal glow, creating a sleek, high-tech atmosphere. The composition is a vertical shot with the hand centrally placed, and the text \"c29\" in a similar glowing, blue-hued font is placed at the bottom right.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The robotic hand's translucent segments rhythmically glow and dim. The lower display's blue light subtly flickers. Gears visibly, slowly grind and rotate. Thin, faint wisps of digital energy emanate from the green circuit board.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The robotic hand's translucent segments snap with blinding flashes of light, surging with erratic power. The lower display explodes into a chaotic tempest of flickering blue light, while gears grind violently, shattering into flying debris. Digital energy erupts from the green circuit board, tearing through the air like miniature lightning bolts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The translucent robotic hand's segments flicker with inverted light, drawing power from nowhere. The circuit board melts into liquid gold, pooling within the palm, while the blue display's symbols morph into glowing birds, flying through solid gears that phase in and out of existence as they spin, infinitely accelerating then instantly freezing, defying all motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom centers on the illuminated green circuit board, its digital energy subtly pulsing outwards. Simultaneously, the clear robotic hand begins a deliberate, almost imperceptible clenching motion. As the translucent segments softly glow and dim in sequence, the gears within subtly grind and rotate, emphasizing the quiet, powerful activation. The blue lower display flickers, casting an ephemeral light as the hand tightens its grip, hinting at impending action.",
