    "video_prompt": "The xenomorph's chest subtly expands and contracts as if breathing, while tiny specks of blue light flicker across its bio-mechanical skin. A soft, almost imperceptible sway affects the back tubes, and the sharp claws on its hands slightly shift as if poised to strike.",
    "image_prompt": "A hyperrealistic and highly detailed close-up of a biomechanical Alien Xenomorph, reminiscent of the creature from the 'Alien' film franchise but with subtle futuristic enhancements. The Xenomorph is predominantly dark, almost black, with a high-gloss, reflective surface that catches light like polished metal.\n\n**Visual Elements & Style:**\nThe creature is shown from the torso up, angled slightly to reveal its imposing silhouette against a bright, hazy sky. Its body features intricate, ribbed, and segmented structures, characteristic of its iconic design. Small, glowing blue lights are subtly embedded throughout its head and upper torso, hinting at internal mechanisms or bio-luminescence, adding a sci-fi touch. Its elongated, smooth dome-like head is prominent, with visible, sharp teeth in its open mouth. The hands are extended, with long, sharp claws, showcasing a predatory stance.\n\n**Composition:**\nThe Alien is positioned slightly off-center, dominating the left side of the frame, with its head directed towards the right. This creates a dynamic, almost confrontational composition. The low angle emphasizes its height and power.\n\n**Colors:**\nThe dominant colors are deep blacks and dark grays for the Xenomorph itself. These are contrasted sharply by the bright, light blue and white of the sky, creating a halo effect around the creature. Hints of green foliage are visible in the blurred background, suggesting a natural, possibly jungle-like environment. The blue internal lights provide a striking accent color.\n\n**Lighting:**\nThe lighting is dramatic and back-lit, with a strong, diffused light source coming from behind and slightly above the creature. This emphasizes its silhouette and creates highlights on its glossy surfaces, giving it a metallic sheen. The blue internal lights glow softly, adding to the ethereal and menacing atmosphere.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nThe atmosphere is one of intense suspense and quiet menace. The bright, almost ethereal background contrasts with the dark, foreboding figure, creating a sense of otherworldliness and danger. The blurring of the background helps to focus attention solely on the creature.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The xenomorph's chest **heaves**, its **bio-luminescent specks** intensifying then dimming. **Trailing tubes undulate**, while **taloned hands subtly clench and release**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The xenomorph's chest **violently** heaves, **explosions** of blue light **blazing** across its skin. Back tubes **whip and snake**, **thrashing** tentacles. Claws **lunge and tear**, **ripping** through the air, **ready to strike with lethal force.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The xenomorph's chest becomes a shimmering galaxy, imploding then expanding, drawing in tiny blue star-specks from its skin which then reform into bioluminescent cosmic dust. Its tubes writhe like ephemeral smoke, phasing through air, while its claws melt and reform into liquid light, defying gravity to drift upwards, then coalesce into impossible geometries, endlessly morphing.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A looming, low-angle shot reveals the Xenomorph, its chest subtly expanding and contracting as if breathing. Blue lights flicker across its bio-mechanical skin, catching the dull metallic gleam. The camera slowly zooms in, emphasizing the subtle sway of the back tubes. Suddenly, a dramatic close-up on its sharp claws as they slightly shift, poised to strike. The scene concludes with the Xenomorph slowly turning its head, its shadowy form dominating the frame against the pale sky.",
