  "video_prompt": "Futuristic fighters dart and crisscross across the vast expanse, firing streaking red and blue laser beams that cut through space. Frequent orange and red explosions erupt, flashing violently. In the mid-ground, a formidable combat vehicle hovers, its underside lights pulsing. Below, ground personnel move about a metallic platform, actively observing and reacting to the intense aerial battle unfolding above. Dynamic light from the explosions and laser fire ripples and shifts across the reflective surfaces and figures.",
  "image_prompt": "An epic, highly detailed, vertical sci-fi image of a futuristic space battle unfolding above a bustling ground operations platform on a massive orbital space station. The scene is dynamic, intense, and dramatic, with a dark blue, black, and grey color palette punctuated by vibrant, contrasting red and blue light accents.\n\nThe upper two-thirds are dominated by chaotic aerial combat: numerous agile dark fighter jets with glowing red thrusters streak across a deep blue-purple void, firing bright red and blue laser beams. Brilliant orange and red explosions erupt frequently. Massive, indistinct capital ships and vertical illuminated structures loom in the distant background, emphasizing an overwhelming scale from a low, looking-up vantage point.\n\nIn the mid-ground, slightly off-center, a large, formidable, blocky dark metallic hovering siege tank with glowing white and blue underskirts acts as a central focal point. An armored pilot/commander with a reflective blue visor and glowing red accents is perched atop it, a heavy weapon mounted behind them.\n\nThe lower third depicts a busy ground-level hangar deck. Its dark, reflective metallic surface shows wet reflections of the cool blue ambient light and warm orange-red explosions from above. Ground crew and soldiers in dark utilitarian uniforms, some carrying rifles, are silhouetted against the bright reflections. Docked ships with glowing blue and orange-red accents are visible, with industrial buildings completing the far background.\n\n**Artistic Style:** Cinematic lighting, hyperrealistic, octane render, volumetric fog, immense scale, dramatic shadows.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Fighters dynamically dart and crisscross, their positions constantly shifting. Streaking red and blue laser beams rapidly fire and traverse the expanse. Frequent orange and red explosions erupt, violently flashing and expanding. A formidable combat vehicle subtly hovers, its underside lights dynamically pulsing. Ground personnel actively move across the platform, their body language and expressions reacting vividly to the intense aerial battle. Dynamic light from the explosions and laser fire constantly ripples and shifts across reflective surfaces and figures."
