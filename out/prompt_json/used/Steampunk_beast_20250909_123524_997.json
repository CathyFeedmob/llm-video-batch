    "video_prompt": "Subtle up-and-down breathing motion in the creature's body, slight sway in the wing membranes, glowing and flickering of the orbs and lights on the mechanical structure, gentle undulation of the tail, small movements in the creature's fangs as if shifting, minuscule dust motes drifting around the creature's mechanical parts, faint shimmer on the metallic surfaces.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on key elements:\n\n\"A detailed, full-body shot of a colossal, heavily armored steampunk-fantasy elephantine creature walking forward on all fours, with large tusks, sharp claws, and a menacing, open mouth revealing jagged teeth. The creature's back is adorned with an elaborate, multi-layered steampunk contraption featuring brass and copper elements, pipes, gauges, large ornate clocks, and glowing blue glass domes, reminiscent of a fantastical mobile fort. Two large, leathery, reddish-brown bat-like wings are attached to the creature's upper back, one prominently displayed on the left, the other smaller and partially visible on the right. The creature's body is dark, with textured skin and hints of purple and brown, and it wears thick, metallic armbands on its legs.\n\nThe composition is dynamic, showing the creature's immense scale as it dominates the foreground. In the background, to the left, are glimpses of dark, industrial structures that resemble ships or buildings with masts. To the right, and above, are ancient, weathered tree trunks and dark green foliage, with one tree heavily textured and showing signs of age. A small, dark, bird-like creature with white highlights is perched on a branch above the steampunk beast.\n\nThe artistic style is reminiscent of a detailed comic book or graphic novel illustration, with strong, clear outlines and a slightly gritty texture. The color palette is muted, primarily using shades of brown, brass, dark green, teal, and occasional pops of reddish-brown and luminous blue. The lighting is soft and ambient, suggesting an overcast or early morning sky, casting subtle shadows that define the forms. The overall atmosphere is fantastical, imposing, and slightly ominous with a strong steampunk aesthetic.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nCreature's body subtly breathes and its wing membranes gently sway. Orbs and lights on the mechanical structure glow and flicker. The tail undulates gently. Fangs make small, shifting movements. Miniscule dust motes drift around the creature's mechanical parts. A faint shimmer plays across metallic surfaces.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Massive mechanical beast suddenly roars, lunging forward! Wings rip as they rapidly unfurl, thrashing wildly. Orbs and lights burst with blinding flashes. Tail whips violently, smashing terrain. Fangs extend, dripping corrosive fluid, jaws snap shut with deafening clang. Dust erupts into a swirling vortex, metallic panels buckle and creak under extreme stress. The tree above quakes, dropping debris as the beast charges, shaking the very ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The creature's mechanical parts spontaneously demanifest, then reform into a cascade of bioluminescent flora and fauna, inversely attracted to the creature's body, which then warps into a liquid-dimensional portal, reflecting endless iterations of itself, with a synchronized, rhythmic pulse that defies physical laws, the glowing orbs unraveling into streams of stardust that reform into the creature's fangs, moving in an antigravitational dance against the sky, as the tree branches above twist into sentient, whispering forms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A majestic Steampunk Elephant, breathing subtly, tail swaying gently, with eyes and mechanical parts flickering dimly. The camera slowly pans upwards, revealing its immense scale. As it turns its head slightly, its fangs subtly shift. The camera zooms out, showcasing the creature amidst a desolate landscape, shrouded in a faint shimmer.",
