  "video_prompt": "Celestial body's rings visibly rotate, with swirling clouds slowly morphing. Haze from water gently rises and falls around the city spires. Golden light at the city's pinnacle subtly pulses. Floating cross and gear-like objects subtly drift. Bioluminescent lights on the water twinkle and shift. Wooden boat gently bobs.",
  "image_prompt": "A breathtaking, otherworldly landscape featuring a colossal, pale blue, ringed planet dominating the sky, above a sprawling, dark gothic city rising from a mystical, dark blue body of water. The city, resembling a cathedral or castle, is adorned with glowing golden spires and intricate details. An ornate golden cross and floating gear-like objects are in the sky, while the water twinkles with bioluminescent lights. A small wooden boat floats in the foreground, near mossy stone steps. The scene uses a dark blue, gray, and black palette with luminous pale blue and golden accents, creating a wondrous, mysterious, and atmospheric image.",
