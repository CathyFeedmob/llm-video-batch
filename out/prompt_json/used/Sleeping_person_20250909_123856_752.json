    "video_prompt": "Gentle rise and fall of the person's chest indicating breathing, sunbeams subtly shifting on the floor, slight shimmering of dust motes in the light, the fan blades slowly rotating, the character on the TV screen subtly swaying.",
    "image_prompt": "A serene, sunny anime-style illustration of an indoor scene with a window overlooking lush greenery. The composition is an elevated, slightly angled shot looking down into a room.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA young girl with short dark hair is sleeping on a light blue pillow and covered by a light green blanket with a floral pattern of pink and red flowers, lying on a tatami mat floor. To her left, a small wooden table holds a plate with two slices of watermelon. To her right, a light brown cushion and a light pink mat are placed on the floor, next to a white and teal standing fan. In the background, an old-fashioned CRT television on a dark wooden stand displays an animated scene of two cartoon children. A green potted plant is visible to the left of the TV stand.\n\n**Style:**\nAnime, Ghibli-esque, with soft outlines and a painterly feel, resembling traditional cel animation or watercolor.\n\n**Composition:**\nHigh-angle shot, asymmetrical balance with the sleeping girl as a central focus. The room is mostly empty space around her, leading the eye towards the window and the television.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are soft greens (blanket, plants, outside scenery), earthy browns (furniture, tatami mats, cushion), and light blues (pillow, fan, some highlights) with accents of pink, red, and yellow. Overall, a warm and natural color palette.\n\n**Lighting:**\nBright, natural sunlight streaming through a large window on the right side of the image, casting distinct shadows of plants and window frames onto the tatami mat floor. The lighting creates a peaceful and warm atmosphere, highlighting the dust particles in the air.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nCalm, peaceful, comfortable, lazy summer day, nostalgic, cozy, and relaxing.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Slow, rhythmic expansion and contraction of the subject's torso. Elongated light patterns gradually stretch and recede across the surface. Minute specks of light glitter and drift within the illumination. Fan blades exhibit a consistent, unhurried rotation. The figure on the screen demonstrates a gentle, undulating motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The TV violently shatters, characters exploding outward, dust motes transform into swirling tempest, watermelon slices levitate and rapidly self-destruct, the fan blades accelerate to blurring speed, the person's chest writhes with rapid, unnatural spasms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The person's chest rhythmically solidifies and liquefies, while sunbeams stretch and coil like serpents, pulling dust motes into sentient vortexes. The fan blades ripple through alternative dimensions, distorting reflections, as the TV characters’ limbs extend, interweaving with the flowing light, their voices echoing backward through time.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly spirals downward, revealing the serene sleeper. A gentle zoom in captures the rhythmic rise and fall of her chest, as a subtle light shift from sunbeams dances across the tatami mats. Dust motes shimmer and swirl in the sun's path, while the fan blades drift lazily, creating subtle air currents. The TV's animated characters subtly sway, mirroring the sleeper's peaceful rhythm, as a slight camera drift reveals the world outside through the window.",
