    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze subtly sways the curtains, causing leaves outside the window to shimmer slightly and casting dancing shadows on the wall and floor. The girl's chest rises and falls with a soft breathing motion. The fan blades slowly rotate. The image on the TV screen subtly shifts. The sunlight streaming through the window flickers slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed watercolor painting capturing summer serenity indoors. The scene features a girl napping on a futon on a tatami mat floor, bathed in warm sunlight streaming through a large window. A vintage red television set with rabbit-ear antennae sits on a dark wooden cabinet, displaying a colorful cartoon scene. Nearby, a pale green oscillating fan provides a gentle breeze, and a slice of watermelon on a plate rests on a small, dark wooden table. The room's walls are a muted, cool gray, contrasting with the vibrant green foliage visible outside the window. Light and shadow interplay across the room, with distinct patterns cast on the floor. Overall, the artwork evokes a feeling of peaceful, nostalgic summer relaxation with a soft, painterly aesthetic. The style is reminiscent of traditional Japanese watercolor art with clear outlines and delicate color washes.\n\nElements:\n- **Central Figure:** A young girl napping on a futon on a tatami mat. She has short dark hair, wears a light blue short-sleeved top and a floral printed blanket. Her posture is relaxed, lying on her side.\n- **Lighting:** Warm, natural sunlight streaming from the large window, casting distinct shadows of window panes and tree leaves on the walls and floor. The room has a quiet, comfortable brightness.\n- **Color Palette:** Dominated by cool grays and blues on the walls and ceiling, contrasting with warm greens of the outside foliage and the sunlit areas. Accents of red (TV, watermelon), and muted floral patterns on the blanket. The overall feel is soft and inviting.\n- **Furniture & Objects:**\n    - A vintage red CRT television with rabbit-ear antennae on a dark wooden cabinet.\n    - A pale green oscillating fan with a white base.\n    - A small, dark wooden table with a slice of watermelon on a white plate.\n    - Tatami mat flooring with visible seams.\n    - A large window with multiple panes, revealing a lush green tree outside.\n    - A cream-colored air conditioner unit mounted high on the wall in the upper left.\n- **Composition:** The scene is framed from a slightly elevated perspective, looking down into the room. The window dominates the right side, while the sleeping girl and television are central. Verticality is emphasized by the window frame and the tall TV cabinet.\n- **Atmosphere:** Peaceful, calm, nostalgic, relaxed, summery, cozy.\n- **Art Style:** Watercolor painting, with visible brushstrokes and a soft, slightly faded quality. The lines are distinct but not harsh. The overall aesthetic leans towards slice-of-life anime or Japanese illustration.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The room convulses violently. The window shatters outward, sending shards exploding as the tree branches outside thrash wildly. The fan blades blur into an unstoppable vortex, launching the watermelon with explosive force. The TV screen bursts with static, then melts into chaotic, burning colors while the armchair underneath tears apart. The girl's form distorts, writhing, muscles rippling under her clothes as she rises, eyes snapping open.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The curtains melt into liquid light, flowing reverse into the sill as the tree outside transforms into a swirling galaxy of green, casting shadows of impossible constellations onto the wall. The girl's chest expands and contracts, exhaling miniature, iridescent butterflies while the fan blades become wings, lifting it to float mid-air. The TV screen pulls characters into its vortex, then ripples with watercolor dreams, as sunlight stretches and twists into serpentine beams, consuming objects within its vibrant glow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Sunlight streams through the window, dappling the room. A gentle breeze stirs the curtains, causing shadows to dance on the wall and floor. The girl on the floor slowly stirs, her eyes fluttering open. She stretches, her limbs extending as she sits up. A glint of light catches her eye from the table, revealing a slice of watermelon. She reaches for it, picking it up. A soft smile plays on her lips as she takes a bite, revealing her carefree spirit. The fan's blades continue their slow rotation, creating a peaceful hum.",
