    "video_prompt": "A mischievous black and white cat with bright yellow eyes and pink paws bursts through a ripped hole in the canvas. Its mouth is open with a pink tongue and small fangs sticking out, a few whiskers are twitching, and claws on its paws are out, ready for action.  The ripped edges of the hole are slightly flapping and a subtle dust falls from the edges after the cat bursts out.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image of the cat bursting through paper:\n\n**\"A highly detailed, realistic illustration of a playful black and white tuxedo cat, with large, bright, glowing yellow-orange eyes and pink nose, paws, and tongue. The cat is emerging from a torn, ripped opening in a light cream or off-white paper or wall. The tears in the paper are sharp and defined, showing jagged edges and some depth, as if the cat is pushing through. The cat's mouth is slightly open, revealing small white teeth and a pink tongue, giving it a surprised or excited expression. The fur of the cat is meticulously detailed, showing individual strands and the soft texture of its white chest and paws, contrasting with the sleek black fur on its head and body. Its front paws are extended forward, showing pink toe beans and neatly trimmed red claws. The background behind the torn paper is pure black, creating a strong contrast and making the cat pop out. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the cat's features and the textures of the torn paper. The overall composition is centered on the cat, with the torn paper creating a dynamic frame. The style is reminiscent of a polished digital illustration or a vector art with rich shading and highlights. Vibrant, clean, and sharp.\"**",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A mischievous black and white cat bursts through a canvas hole, its mouth open with twitching whiskers and extending claws. The ripped canvas edges flap, and subtle dust settles as the cat emerges.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A mischievous black and white cat, eyes gleaming, violently rips through the canvas, tearing paper shreds outward. Fur bursts, whiskers twitch erratically, and claws aggressively extend as it lunges. The ripped edges of the hole, flapping wildly, explode outwards with cascading dust, as if the canvas itself is recoiling from the sudden, powerful emergence, followed by a dramatic, unsettling stillness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cat's fur, a swirling vortex of inverse colors, pulls the canvas inward, stitching itself back together as the cat recedes. Its yellow eyes refract impossible geometries, bending light into cosmic dust that settles upwards. Each outstretched paw distorts reality, spawning miniature, inverted cats that melt into the background, leaving trails of shimmering void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "CLOSE-UP on the ripped paper, trembling before the cat's sudden burst. A quick PAN to the left reveals the mischievous CAT's yellow eyes, then a rapid PUSH IN as its mouth opens, fangs glinting. SWEEPING CRANE SHOT as the cat lunges, paws and claws extended, \"bursting\" through the canvas. DUST motes catch the light, adding drama. The ripped edges of the canvas flutter in its wake.",
