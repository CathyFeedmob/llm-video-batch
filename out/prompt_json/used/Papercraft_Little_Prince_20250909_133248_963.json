    "video_prompt": "The Little Prince's scarf and cape gently sway as if caught in a light breeze. The small, white paper fans occasionally flutter. Tiny white dust motes drift slowly across the background. The leaves on the paper trees subtly rustle.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down into its key visual elements:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"Highly detailed quilling art illustration of The Little Prince standing on a small, textured, spherical planet with rings, reminiscent of Saturn. The Prince has bright yellow, spiky hair, a cute, simple face with black dot eyes, and a small smile. He wears a teal tunic with three golden buttons and a golden belt, and teal pleated trousers. A long, flowing golden scarf or cape extends behind him in a graceful curve, acting as a backdrop feature.\n\nThe background is a soft, light grey, adorned with several small, white, folded paper fan-like elements and tiny white dots scattered around. On the planet, there are intricate quilling art trees with rich green, pleated leaves and brown paper trunks. The planet itself is cream-colored with subtle texture and indentations, encircled by a bright yellow quilling ring. Several colorful quilled spiral elements in teal, pink, and cream are embedded in the planet's surface.\n\nThe entire scene is rendered in a clean, crisp quilling paper art style, with visible strips and folds, emphasizing depth and texture. The lighting is bright and even, creating soft shadows and highlighting the dimensionality of the paper elements. The composition is centered, with The Little Prince as the focal point, balanced by the planet below and the flowing scarf/cape above, conveying a serene and whimsical atmosphere.\"",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The Little Prince's scarf and cape whip violently, snapping in a furious gale! White paper fans rip free, swirling like a blizzard! Dust motes explode into a chaotic storm! Paper trees thrash, their leaves tearing apart, as the very planet beneath him shudders and cracks, its rings spiraling outwards in a cataclysmic dance!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The Little Prince's scarf and cape whip erratically against unseen currents, morphing into swirling nebulae before snapping back. The white paper fans blossom into living birds that flutter impossibly, then dissolve back into paper. Trees on the tiny planet grow skyward through the planet itself, shedding shimmering, temporal leaves that drift upwards, coalescing into new fans.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A tight, slow zoom focuses on the Little Prince's face,\nthen pulls back into a sweeping crane shot, revealing his billowing scarf and cape, now dramatically extended by a powerful gust. The paper fans flutter wildly, several detaching and spiraling away. The paper trees violently rustle, shedding leaves. A dramatic shadow passes across the Little Prince's face, implying a sudden shift in lighting.",
