    "video_prompt": "A subtle breeze causes the man's hooded jacket to gently sway, with slight fluttering and stretching of the fabric. Faint wisps of dust and debris drift upwards from the crumbling rooftop around his feet. Tiny glints of light occasionally flicker on the distant building windows as the sun shifts. Subtle, almost imperceptible undulations of distant city lights hint at movement far below. The camera subtly zooms in an almost undetectable amount, suggesting a slow, purposeful approach.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on recreating the visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere of the original image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A highly detailed, cinematic wide shot of a lone figure standing on a dilapidated, rusty rooftop ledge overlooking a vast, sprawling futuristic cityscape at sunset. The figure, seen from behind, is a man wearing a dirty, tattered, blood-splattered hoodie or trench coat, looking out towards the horizon. The dominant feature in the background is a towering, slender skyscraper with numerous lighted windows, positioned centrally, with the setting sun directly behind its upper half, creating a bright orange glow and atmospheric haze throughout the sky and distant buildings. The sky is a dramatic blend of deep orange, red, and hints of dark grey clouds. The city beneath is a deep, moody blue and grey, with scattered warm lights from buildings creating a sense of depth and scale. Grimy, brutalist, and modern architectural styles intermingle. The foreground rooftop shows intricate details of worn metal, industrial clutter, and broken concrete. The overall mood is post-apocalyptic, solemn, and awe-inspiring. The lighting is strong backlighting from the sun, casting the figure and foreground into dramatic silhouette and shadow, contrasting with the vibrant sky. Concept art, high render quality, volumetric lighting, epic scale.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The man's hooded jacket gently sways, its fabric fluttering. Wisps of dust rise from the crumbling rooftop. Distant windows briefly glint. City lights subtly undulate. The camera imperceptibly zooms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The man's blood-splattered jacket violently whips and snaps, ripped by unseen forces. Debris explodes from the crumbling rooftop, swirling into a chaotic vortex. Distant building lights flash erratically, then surge into blinding beams. The cityscape below erupts in a cascade of flickering power surges and sudden blackouts. The camera lunges forward, zooming in with a jarring, rapid thrust, as if pulled by an invisible, accelerating force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The distant city lights shimmer, then morph into colossal, swirling constellations, pulling in the sun which becomes a flickering eye. The man’s jacket unravels into spectral ribbons that writhe upwards, transforming into ethereal hands that caress the sky. Buildings undulate like jellyfish, their windows weeping luminous tears that float upwards as the debris from the rooftop constructs itself into a shimmering, inverted mountain beneath his feet. The camera dives through impossible wormholes, revealing the city as a living, breathing organism of twisting, evolving forms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The lens subtly expands, revealing the man's tattered jacket as a faint breeze rustles it from below, sending dust motes swirling around his gritty boots. The camera then smoothly tilts downward, a slow reveal of the dizzying city abyss before sweeping up to frame the sun setting behind the tallest skyscraper, its last rays flickering across the dark cityscape.",
