  "video_prompt": "A massive robotic eye's iris, filled with \"The Starry Night,\" slowly swirls and pulses with internal blue light. Iridescent, reflective ribbons undulate around the eye, their colors shifting. Tiny, translucent, gem-like cubes subtly orbit the eye within the ribbon currents. A neon blue triangle superimposed on the iris flickers and brightens.",
  "image_prompt": "Highly stylized, surreal digital artwork: A massive, detailed robotic eye with intricate metallic casing and glowing blue/teal accents. Its iris contains Vincent van Gogh's \"The Starry Night,\" overlaid with a glowing neon blue triangle. The eye is embedded in swirling, iridescent ribbons of silver, blue, purple, and green, with scattered translucent gem-like cubes. Subtle digital matrix patterns in the dark background. Dramatic lighting, blending futuristic tech with human artistry.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Patterns resembling \"The Starry Night\" slowly swirl and shift within the iris, its inherent blue light pulsing. Ribbons undulate, reflecting and shimmering with iridescent shifts. Cubes subtly orbit, displaying tiny, translucent, gem-like qualities as they're carried by ribbon currents. A superimposed triangle flickers, its neon blue luminescence intensifying across the iris."
