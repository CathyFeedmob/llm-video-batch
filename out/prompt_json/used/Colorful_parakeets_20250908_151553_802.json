    "video_prompt": "Three colorful budgerigars (budgies) on a wet rock in the rain. The rain is falling lightly, creating subtle ripples on the water surface around the rock. Water droplets on the lily pads glisten and occasionally fall. A gentle sway of the lotus leaves. The budgies' chests subtly expand and contract as if breathing.",
    "image_prompt": "**Title:** Three Budgies Under a Lotus Leaf in Rain\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot of three colorful budgerigars (budgies) perched closely together on a wet, dark grey rock in a tranquil pond, sheltering under a large green lotus leaf during a gentle rainfall. The budgies are arranged from left to right: a white one with a pinkish beak, a blue one with a striped head and a yellow beak, and a vibrant pink one with a yellow beak. Their feet are visible on the rock, and their feathers appear soft and slightly damp.\n\nThe dominant visual elements in the background are several large, lush green lotus leaves, some with visible stems, and two beautiful pink lotus flowers. One lotus flower is in full bloom, partially obscured by a leaf, and positioned above and slightly to the right of the birds. Another lotus bud is visible on the far left, partially out of frame.\n\nRaindrops are clearly visible in the air, creating fine white streaks across the scene. The surfaces of the lotus leaves are covered in numerous small water droplets, reflecting the light. The water surface of the pond is calm, showing subtle reflections.\n\n**Composition:** The birds are centrally located at the bottom third of the frame, firmly grounded on the rock. The large lotus leaf acts as a natural umbrella, framing the birds from above and providing a sense of shelter. The background foliage and flowers create depth and context.\n\n**Colors:** The image features a vibrant yet natural palette. Dominant greens from the lotus leaves, rich blues, pinks, and white from the birds. The pink lotus flowers add a warm accent. Water and rock provide dark, grounding tones.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused natural light typical of an overcast or rainy day, highlighting the water droplets and the smooth texture of the birds' feathers. There's a gentle glow from the top implied by the light hitting the water droplets.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Peaceful, serene, cozy, and natural. The rainfall adds a soothing and refreshing element.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, photographic, high-detail with a shallow depth of field that keeps the birds and immediate surroundings in sharp focus, while the background is subtly blurred to emphasize the subjects.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rain subtly ripples the water around a wet rock. Water droplets glisten and fall from lily pads. Lotus leaves gently sway. Budgies' chests expand and contract with breath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Torrential downpour lashes the scene! Jagged lightning strikes the rock, causing the budgies to shriek and erupt into a frantic, rainbow blur of flapping wings, dodging colossal, crashing droplets. The lotus pads violently convulse and whip, launching geysers of water skyward as lightning illuminates their thrashing forms. The lily pads detonate, sending shattered bits flying. The rock ruptures, creating a vortex around the terrified, careening birds. WATER EXPLODES UPWARD.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Inverted raindrops defy gravity, reforming into crystalline birds that phase through the breathing lotus leaves. The rock pulsates, morphing into a liquid mirror reflecting fragmented, multicolored budgerigars that impossibly interlace with each other, their feathers rippling like water. Each \"breath\" from the birds sends ripples of color through the lily pads, causing them to unfurl and cocoon the scene in a transient, iridescent dome of impossible light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic slow zoom-in focuses on the vibrant budgies. The camera then smoothly pans across the wet, glistening lily pads, revealing falling water droplets and the gentle sway of lotus leaves. A sudden, dramatic gust of wind sends a shower of water from a lotus leaf onto the rock just as the camera pushes in on the budgies, capturing their subtle flinch. The camera pulls back, revealing the continuous light rain and ripples, the vibrant colors of the budgies a striking contrast against the serene, rain-soaked environment.",
