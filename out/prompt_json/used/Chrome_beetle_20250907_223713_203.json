    "video_prompt": "A slow, subtle camera pan across the beetle's metallic surface, reflecting the city lights. The neon light trails within the beetle's body gently pulsate and shift color. Occasional, very faint glints of light catch on the beetle's legs and antennae as if from distant reflections.",
    "image_prompt": "A striking close-up, eye-level shot of a highly detailed, chrome-plated scarab beetle, shimmering with metallic reflections. The beetle is centered in the frame, facing slightly forward. Its elytra (wing covers) are translucent, revealing a mesmerizing cityscape with tall skyscrapers and vibrant, neon-lit architectural elements. Bright blue and purple light trails, resembling data streams or energy lines, criss-cross horizontally across the cityscape within the beetle's body. The background is a soft, out-of-focus blur of pastel colors—pinks, blues, yellows, and oranges—creating a dreamlike aura. The lighting is dramatic, with bright highlights on the beetle's shiny surface and the illuminated cityscape within. The overall aesthetic is futuristic, sleek, and high-tech, with a touch of surrealism. A subtle, glowing text `c29` is positioned in the bottom right corner of the image.\n\n**Art Styles**: Cyberpunk art, high-tech, futuristic, macro photography, metallic luster, neon art, digital art.\n\n**Visual Elements**: Chrome beetle, transparent elytra, city reflection, skyscrapers, neon light trails, blurred background.\n\n**Colors**: Silver, chrome, electric blue, vibrant purple, pastel pink, pastel blue, yellow, orange.\n\n**Lighting**: Backlit, strong reflections, glowing elements, soft ambient light from the background.\n\n**Composition**: Centralized subject, eye-level shot, shallow depth of field, leading lines from the light trails.\n\n**Atmosphere**: Futuristic, mysterious, innovative, dreamlike, high-energy.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera slowly glides, revealing shifting reflections of city lights on the beetle's surface. Internal neon pulsates and subtly changes hues. Distant light catch & fade on its limbs.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**The metallic beetle EXPLODES forward, its carapace rippling like liquid chrome. Neon trails within it ERUPT, flaring with violent pulses. Legs CHURN, antennae WHIP. The reflected city SWIRLS, warped and contorted, as the beetle SHATTERS through the frame like a bullet.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The metallic beetle's shell becomes a swirling nebula, city lights within warp into abstract neon rivers. Its legs detach, floating like lunar modules, occasionally forming a geometric dance. Antennae, now ethereal wisps, stretch to encompass warped cityscapes before retracting into impossible dimensions. The beetle's body pulsates inversed gravity, briefly becoming a kaleidoscopic portal before re-solidifying into its metallic form.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly pans across the beetle's gleaming metallic shell, revealing the vibrant city lights reflected within its surface. Neon trails inside pulsate with ethereal glow, shifting colors subtly. A dramatic, slow zoom highlights the intricate reflections on its legs and antennae, hinting at hidden depths. The beetle slightly rotates, catching a brilliant, momentary glint.",
