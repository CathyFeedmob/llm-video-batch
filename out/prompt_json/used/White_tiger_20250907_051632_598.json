    "video_prompt": "Subtle tail sway, glowing purple mist around paws subtly expands and contracts, eyes have a gentle flicker of light, and the overall image has a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom in.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot of a majestic white tiger with black stripes, seen from a low-angle, eye-level perspective, charging forward directly towards the viewer. The tiger has piercing, glowing purple eyes and its mouth is open, revealing sharp teeth and fangs in a fierce snarl. Its fur is detailed, appearing soft yet powerful. Wispy, ethereal purple energy trails and glows around its paws and extends subtly behind its body, suggesting speed and magical power, creating a dynamic effect. The tiger is positioned centrally, taking up most of the frame, with its front paws seemingly just above the bottom edge.\n\nThe background is a soft, overcast sky, rendering a muted blue-grey color palette with subtle hints of lighter clouds and faint purple mist blending into the atmosphere. Tiny, sparkling particles are scattered in the air, especially around the purple energy. The lighting is dramatic, emphasizing the tiger's form and the glow of its eyes and magic. The overall atmosphere is intense, mystical, and action-oriented. The art style is hyperrealistic with a fantasy element, resembling digital painting or high-detail CGI. The composition is strong and direct, drawing the viewer into the tiger's path. A small, stylized \"C29\" logo is subtly placed in the bottom right corner, glowing faintly.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle tail sway. Glowing purple mist around paws subtly expands and contracts. Eyes have a gentle flicker of light. Very slow, almost imperceptible zoom in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "White tiger lunges forward, claws raking, purple energy erupts from paws, crackling lightning. Eyes blaze, pupils dilate, teeth snap aggressively. Tail whips violently, blurring stripes. Foreground mist explodes outwards, air shimmers from raw power, creating shockwaves. The ground beneath it seems to undulate, reacting to the sheer force of its strike.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The white tiger begins to dissolve into shimmering stardust that drifts upwards, coalescing into glowing constellations. Its roar transforms notes of a celestial symphony, causing the stars to expand and contract, morphing into abstract shapes of pure energy. The purple mist beneath its paws ignites into a nebulae, pulling galactic fragments into its orbit as the entire scene compresses into a single, pulsing point of light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone white tiger emerges from mist, its tail subtly swaying, eyes glowing with latent power. As it stalks forward, purple energy swirls around its paws, expanding and contracting with each silent step. A slow, dramatic zoom-in highlights its piercing gaze and bared fangs, revealing a hint of the ferocity within. The mist begins to envelop the tiger, lending an air of mystique and power to its presence.",
