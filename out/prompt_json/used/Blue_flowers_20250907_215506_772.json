    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA visually striking, high-contrast, mystical composition featuring deep blue flowers and petals swirling around a bright central light source, forming a captivating spiral. The background is pure black, creating a stark contrast with the vibrant blues.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n*   **Flowers:** Abundant, four-petaled flowers, appearing to be glowing from within. Each petal is a rich, luminous blue with lighter, almost white, veins extending from its base. The edges of the petals are distinctly outlined.\n*   **Petals:** Numerous individual petals are scattered throughout the swirl, appearing to be detached from the flowers. They share the same luminous blue color and vein details as the flower petals, some showing their lighter undersides.\n*   **Swirling Effect:** All elements (flowers, petals, and light trails) are arranged in a dynamic, clockwise spiral pattern, drawing the eye towards the bright center.\n*   **Light Trails/Particles:** Thin, luminous blue lines and small, glowing particles follow the spiral path, creating a sense of motion and energy within the dark space.\n\n**Style:**\n\n*   **Fractal/Abstract:** The overall composition has a mesmerizing, almost fractal quality due to the repeating patterns and swirling motion.\n*   **Dreamlike/Fantasy:** The glowing elements and floating flowers evoke a sense of a magical or fantastical realm.\n*   **Digital Art:** The sharp lines, glowing effects, and clean rendering suggest a digital art style.\n\n**Composition:**\n\n*   **Central Focus:** A brilliant, white, circular light source acts as the vortex's center, pulling the viewer's gaze.\n*   **Spiral Arrangement:** The primary compositional structure is a strong spiral leading into the center.\n*   **Sense of Depth:** Elements diminish in size and detail as they recede into the central vortex, creating a strong perception of depth.\n*   **Dynamic Flow:** The arrangement suggests continuous, rapid movement outwards from the center and inwards towards it.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   **Dominant Blue:** A prominent, vibrant, and luminous spectrum of blues, ranging from electric blue to very dark navy where they fade into the background.\n*   **Bright White:** The intense white light at the spiral's core.\n*   **Pure Black:** The vast, velvety black background providing maximum contrast and depth.\n*   **Subtle Yellow/Cream:** A very slight hint of yellowish or creamy color at the base of some flower petals, especially those closer to the edges.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n*   **Internal Glow:** The flowers and petals appear to glow from within, rather than being illuminated by an external source.\n*   **Central Luminescence:** The brightest light emanates from the core of the spiral, casting a subtle radial glow.\n*   **Contrasting Shadows:** The black background creates deep \"shadows\" by absorbing light, emphasizing the glowing elements.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Mysterious:** The dark background and glowing elements create an enigmatic and intriguing atmosphere.\n*   **Ethereal:** The floating, luminous flowers evoke a sense of otherworldly beauty.\n*   **Energetic/Dynamic:** The swirling motion conveys a powerful sense of energy and movement.\n*   **Peaceful yet Intense:** A captivating blend of serene beauty and intense visual dynamism.\n\n**Trademark/Logo:**\n\n*   **\"c29\" Logo:** A white and blue, stylized \"c29\" logo is present in the bottom right corner, suggesting a brand or artist signature.

    "refined_video_prompt": "Blue petals and glowing particles subtly swirl and stream towards the bright, gently pulsing central vortex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive blue petals erupt from a swirling vortex, streaking outwards in a furious, accelerating cascade. The central light pulses with increasing intensity, sending shockwaves that violently contort the surrounding space. Jagged streaks of light rip through the darkness as petals transform into glowing, ethereal blurs, twisting and coiling with supernatural force. A maelstrom of light and form, constantly reshaping and expanding with terrifying speed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A luminous black hole at the center pulls blue flowers and glowing petals into an ethereal spiral, their form fluidly morphing into radiant energy streaks. The vortex subtly pulses, reversing its gravitational pull, launching entire flowers backwards, growing larger as they travel. Petals transform into floating whispers of light, elegantly dancing through space, defying gravity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A swirling vortex of luminous blue petals and shimmering particles pulsates with ethereal light. The camera dramatically zooms in on the widening spiral, revealing streaks of glowing energy drawing everything towards its radiant core. As the central light intensifies with a gentle pulse, the petals and streams accelerate into a breathtaking, spiraling ballet of light and motion, creating an otherworldly sense of wonder and cosmic drama.",
