    "video_prompt": "The mech's internal green lights subtly pulse and flicker. The woman's hair gently sways, and her eyes occasionally blink. The mech's limbs exhibit a subtle, rhythmic \"breathing\" movement, as if adjusting its weight. Dust particles gently drift in the air around the mech, responding to an imperceptible breeze. The camera has a very subtle, slow zoom out, almost imperceptible.",
    "image_prompt": "A large, bipedal mech suit heavily armored in metallic dark grey and black, with glowing green accents on its joints and interior machinery. The mech features robust, articulated limbs designed for walking on uneven terrain. The upper part of the mech houses a transparent, dome-shaped cockpit, resembling an egg, made of glass or clear plastic with intricate digital displays and green circuit patterns visible inside. Seated within the cockpit is a young, fair-skinned female pilot with dark hair, wearing a sleek, dark grey or black form-fitting suit, headphones, and gloves, her hands appearing to operate controls.\n\nThe mech stands on a barren, cratered lunar or rocky landscape, consistent with a moon or distant planet. Various debris and destroyed structures lay scattered across the ground, hinting at a scene of past conflict or abandoned infrastructure. The background beyond the landscape is a deep, dark space, with faint artificial lights or distant structures on the horizon. The lighting is dramatic, with subtle reflections on the mech's metallic surfaces and the glowing green elements providing a stark contrast. The overall atmosphere is futuristic, action-oriented, and somewhat desolate. A small, black box with Chinese characters and \"AI\" is located in the top left corner, and \"c29\" in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle pulsing and flickering of internal green lights within the mech. The woman’s hair gently sways, and her eyes blink. The mech's limbs rhythmically \"breathe.\" Dust particles drift, responding to a breeze. Imperceptible, slow camera zoom out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The mech lurches forward, its internal lights flaring violently as the woman screams, wrenching the controls. Dust explodes upwards as the ground cracks beneath its heavy, stomping feet. Metallic limbs thrash erratically, threatening to tear apart their joints. Debris around them abruptly swirls into a vortex as the camera rapidly zooms out, capturing the chaos intensifying around the violently shuddering mech.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The mech's internal green lights pulse, morphing into bioluminescent jellyfish that float out. The woman's hair extends and retracts like tendrils, her eyes replaced by shimmering galaxies. The mech's limbs ripple like water, melting and reforming with each \"breath.\" Dust particles coalesce into ethereal figures that dance in reverse, while solid ground turns to liquid. The camera slowly zooms out, revealing the entire scene reflected upside down in a cosmic tear.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Camera slowly pans up from the distressed lunar surface, revealing the massive mech's imposing scale. As it settles, the mech itself, driven by the pilot's focused movements, slowly rises. The green internal lights burst into a vibrant glow, casting an eerie hue onto the pilot's determined face. Dust motes swirl around the mech's metallic feet, caught in an unseen wind, as the camera slowly pulls back, showcasing the desolate, cratered landscape.",
