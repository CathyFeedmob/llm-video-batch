Celestial bodies subtly shift in the background, hinting at their vast distances. The entire complex hums with perpetual, epic activity. \n",
  "image_prompt": "Highly detailed, vertical epic sci-fi panorama: a colossal, dark-grey alien city/space station complex, viewed from below, dominated by massive, textured structures with glowing red, orange, blue, and white accents (lights, thrusters, energy). Streaks of fiery orange and blue light suggest movement and activity. In the swirling blue and purple cosmic background, vibrant nebulae, distant stars, and multiple celestial bodies (including prominent reddish-orange, cratered planets) are visible. Smaller spacecraft/drones navigate between structures, adding to the bustling, grand-scale space opera aesthetic with dramatic lighting.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "An alien city dramatically unfurls, expanding upwards. Glowing elements incessantly pulsate. Thrusters ignite and propel objects rapidly. Energy streaks intensely, traversing monumental, ever-shifting structures. Agile spacecraft continually dart and weave through the reconfiguring massive forms. Celestial bodies subtly drift, rotate, and alter their distant positions in the background. The entire complex vibrates with perpetual, epic dynamism."
