    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on recreating its visual characteristics:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA visually striking, minimalist, and modern architectural interior. The primary scene is a long, stark white hallway or corridor with a high ceiling, creating a strong sense of depth and perspective. The hallway is lined on both sides with evenly spaced, rectangular white columns or rectangular cutouts, acting as light sources from within, casting soft, subtle shadows on the adjacent walls and ceiling, especially further down the corridor. These illuminated vertical elements create a rhythmic, repeating pattern that recedes into the distance.\n\nThe floor is a highly polished, light-colored (off-white or very light grey) marble or glossy tile, reflecting the columns and the light above with crisp, elongated reflections that mirror the architectural elements, enhancing the symmetry and illusion of length. A thin, dark, horizontal strip (likely polished stainless steel or a similar material) runs along the base of each column and along the walls just above the floor, providing a subtle line detail and visual anchor.\n\nAt the very end of the hallway, a dark rectangular opening, possibly a doorway or a window to another space, is visible, creating a strong vanishing point and drawing the eye. It appears to be framed by dark material (like dark metal or glass) and shows a hint of a darker, possibly blue-tinted interior or exterior through its glass panels.\n\nThe lighting is bright, even, and almost ethereal, emanating primarily from the luminous vertical sections of the walls/columns, creating a glow that highlights the clean lines and smooth surfaces. The overall color palette is almost exclusively white and very light grey, with minimal dark accents at the baseboards and the distant opening. The atmosphere is stark, serene, clean, futuristic, and slightly mysterious, emphasizing geometric precision and light.\n\n**Key visual elements to emphasize:**\n\n*   **Color:** Predominantly white, off-white, very light grey, with minimal dark grey/black and possibly a hint of deep blue from the distant opening.\n*   **Lighting:** Indirect, luminous, evenly distributed, creating soft, elongated shadows on walls and ceiling.\n*   **Composition:** Strong one-point perspective, perfectly symmetrical, leading lines created by columns and floor reflections converging at the distant opening.\n*   **Surfaces:** Glossy, reflective floor; smooth, matte walls and ceiling.\n*   **Architecture:** Repetitive, rectangular columns/recesses, clean lines, minimalist design.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Serene, sterile, modern, futuristic, awe-inspiring.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Light shimmers on surfaces, ebbing and flowing. Reflections on the floor brighten and soften, mirroring the subtle light movements.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Light shatters and reforms, ripping along the walls and floor in explosive bursts. The polished floor pulsates with blinding reflections, then plunges into sudden darkness. Pillars violently shift, twisting and collapsing inward, only to snap back into place. The distant doorway contorts, spitting out phantom forms that writhe and vanish in a flash of brilliant light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Invisible forces contort the rectangular columns, twisting them into fluid spirals that ripple and merge into the illuminated floor. The reflected light on the polished surface dances independently, reforming into impossible three-dimensional specters that phase through the solid walls, leaving trails of ethereal glow in their wake.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, ethereal drift guides us through a pristine, white hallway. Subtle light variations ripple along the walls and floor, mimicking a gentle breeze. Glimmers intensify and recede on the polished floor, reflecting the faint shifts in light. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the far end, their silhouette growing larger with each step, creating long, dancing shadows that stretch and sway along the walls, echoing the rhythmic play of light.",
