    "video_prompt": "Subtle breathing motion of the green monster; slight swaying of trees and grass in the breeze; gentle shimmer on the water in the background stream; slight undulation of the monster's fur.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant and cheerful scene featuring a colossal, fluffy green monster with large, friendly eyes and small horns, playfully interacting with miniature, snow-capped mountains. The monster's head and upper body dominate the upper half of the frame, smiling down at the foreground.\n\n**Composition:** The monster is positioned centrally and prominently, with its head slightly angled to the right, looking downwards. Its large scale is emphasized by the tiny snowy peaks which it appears to be holding or playing with. The foreground features a lush green valley with rolling hills, scattered evergreen trees, smaller deciduous trees, and a winding path. In the background, there are more distant, hazy green mountains. The view is from a low angle, looking slightly upwards towards the monster.\n\n**Style:** Animated, whimsical, and slightly fantastical, reminiscent of a Pixar or DreamWorks animation. The style is cute and friendly, with soft textures and round forms.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Monster:** A giant, shaggy, vibrant green creature with thick fur. It has large, expressive white eyes with big green pupils and black outlines, giving it a very sweet and innocent look. Small, light brown horns protrude from its head. Its nose is soft and dark green, and its mouth forms a gentle, closed smile. Its fur appears soft and inviting.\n*   **Mountains:** In the foreground, there are small, cartoonish mountains with snow-capped peaks. The rock faces are greyish, and the lower slopes are covered in bright green grass with small evergreen trees.\n*   **Landscape:** The valley is verdant and pastoral, with undulating green hills. Numerous evergreen trees (spruce/pine-like) are scattered throughout, along with some smaller, rounder deciduous trees with yellow-green foliage. A narrow, light brown dirt path winds through the grass in the foreground. A hint of water (perhaps a stream or small pond) is visible in the mid-ground.\n*   **Sky:** A clear, bright blue sky with no clouds, indicating a sunny day.\n\n**Colors:** Dominated by various shades of green (lime green for the monster, emerald and olive for the landscape), bright white (snow), light grey (mountain rock), and clear blue (sky). Small accents of light brown (horns, path) and yellow-green (deciduous trees).\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, natural daylight from above, casting subtle shadows that give depth to the fur and landscape without being harsh. The scene is evenly lit, contributing to the cheerful and inviting atmosphere.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Whimsical, playful, friendly, and serene. It evokes a sense of gentle giant, wonder, and fantasy.\n\n**To recreate this image, the prompt should focus on:** \"Giant fluffy green monster, cartoon style, very large friendly eyes, small horns, smiling, interacting with small snow-capped mountains in a lush green valley. Low angle shot, bright natural lighting, clear blue sky, Pixar animation quality. Rolling hills, evergreen trees, winding dirt path. Whimsical, playful, serene atmosphere. Full body shot, looking down at the mountains.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few options, refining your prompt to be even more concise and focused on dynamic elements for an Image-to-Video model:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on subtle, natural movement):**\nGentle undulation of the green monster's fur and torso as it breathes. Trees and tall grass subtly sway in a light breeze. The distant stream's surface shimmers softly.\n\n**Option 2 (More active, but still subtle):**\nThe green monster's chest subtly expands and contracts. Leaves and blades of grass gently rustle. A gentle ripple spreads across the water's surface.\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasizing organic flow):**\nSubtle, rhythmic breathing of the green monster. Continuous, gentle swaying of foliage. Light, continuous shimmer across the background stream.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal green monster unleashes a thunderous roar, wind ripping through its fur as it violently smashes a snow-capped mountain. Trees uproot and hurl into the sky; the stream erupts into a geyser. The ground fissures and buckles under the explosive impact.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The colossal green monster's fur ripples and coalesces into a vibrant aurora, pulling the nearby mountains into its fuzzy embrace. Trees grow roots into the sky, gracefully swaying to an unheard melody, while a shimmering, upside-down waterfall defies gravity, flowing from the ground into the clouds. The monster's eyes become swirling galaxies, expanding and contracting, altering the landscape with each blink as clouds of light rain upward through warped dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A massive, fluffy green monster's head slowly rises over a snow-capped peak, eyes wide and curious. A sweeping aerial shot reveals the lush valley below, then dramatically zooms in as the monster's colossal, furry paw gently presses down beside the mountain, causing the snow to softly drift. The monster's fur subtly ripples, and trees sway gently as the wind, stirred by its presence, washes over the serene landscape.",
