    "video_prompt": "Water surface ripples gently with light reflections, underwater plants sway, and small fish swim and dart among them. Sunlight shimmers through the trees and across the water. A gentle breeze causes leaves and flowers to subtly move.",
    "image_prompt": "A breathtaking dual-perspective image capturing a vibrant natural landscape above and below the waterline. The upper portion depicts a serene river flowing through a lush, mountainous valley bathed in the warm glow of a sunset. The sky is a dramatic blend of fiery oranges, soft pinks, and faint blues, with scattered clouds. Dense, verdant trees and flowering bushes, in shades of deep green, purple, and red, line the riverbanks. The water's surface reflects the captivating sunset hues.\n\nBelow the waterline, the underwater world is illuminated by shafts of sunlight piercing through the surface, creating visible light rays. Numerous bright orange goldfish with white fins swim gracefully amidst a rich tapestry of aquatic plants and smooth river rocks. The underwater foliage ranges from deep green broad leaves to delicate, feathery fronds, with hints of red and pink blossoms. The overall atmosphere is magical and tranquil, emphasizing the interconnected beauty of the natural world.\n\n**Key visual elements:** River, valley, mountains, trees, flowering bushes, rocks, sunset, clouds, water surface, underwater, goldfish, aquatic plants, light rays.\n**Colors:** Dominant warm oranges and pinks (sunset), varied greens, blues (sky and water), bright orange (goldfish), hints of purple and red (flowers/plants).\n**Lighting:** Golden hour/sunset lighting above, dappled sunlight with distinct rays underwater.\n**Composition:** Divided horizontally, with the waterline serving as a clear separator. Depth is created by the receding valley and the layered underwater environment.\n**Atmosphere:** Serene, magical, tranquil, vibrant, natural beauty.\n**Style:** Realistic, richly detailed, slightly dreamlike given the vibrant colors and clear underwater visibility.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rippling water, swaying underwater plants with darting fish. Sunlight shimmers through moving trees and across the water. Breeze-stirred leaves and flowers exhibit subtle motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Water surface violently churns, light reflecting chaotically as a colossal, predatory fish erupts from the depths, scattering the smaller fish in a frenzy. Underwater plants thrash and snap from the sudden currents. Sunlight explodes across the sky, trees contorting and swaying with unnatural force. A powerful gale rips through the landscape, tearing at leaves and flowers that wildly writhe. The entire scene is consumed by a whirlwind of violent, unpredictable motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Impossible video: Goldfish swim *through* the water surface into the sky, morphing into crimson clouds that drift across the inverted landscape. Trees bleed iridescent light, their roots reaching upwards. Underwater plants *levitate*, forming impossible floral constellations. The sun, now liquid, splatters across the sky, creating shimmering puddles that reflect an alternate dimension where the fish are stars.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Dawn light explodes across the forest, leaves stirring with the first breath of wind. Camera dives, gliding beneath the water's surface, tracking a solo goldfish darting through sunlit beams. A rapid zoom-in reveals the intricate dance of flora swaying in the gentle current. Suddenly, the fish breaches, leaping momentarily through the golden reflection, before plunging back into the luminous depths.",
