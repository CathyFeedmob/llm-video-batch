    "video_prompt": "The glitter on her face and body subtly shimmers. The colorful strokes of her hair gently sway. Her lips part slightly as if taking a breath. The bright background strokes subtly shift in color and luminance, like light reflecting off an uneven surface.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant close-up portrait of a woman, rendered in a heavily textured, impasto oil painting style reminiscent of a palette knife technique. The woman's head is tilted upwards in profile, facing left, with her eyes closed, suggesting bliss or serenity.\n\n**Visual Elements and Composition:**\n- The woman's face and upper chest are the primary focus, painted with a smooth, glossy texture that contrasts with the heavily textured background and hair.\n- Her skin is a warm, peachy pink, with prominent highlights and a luminous quality.\n- Glittering, circular white \"sparkles\" or droplets are scattered across her forehead, cheeks, nose, lips, neck, and upper chest, adding a magical or ethereal touch.\n- Her lips are full and painted a bold, glossy fuchsia pink.\n- Her eyelids are adorned with glittery, shimmering purple eyeshadow, and her eyelashes are long and dark.\n- Her eyebrows are defined and dark brown.\n- Her hair cascades behind her, depicted with broad, thick strokes of teal, bright orange, deep purple, and hints of pink, creating a dynamic, almost feathery or flowing effect. Some strands appear to be individual brushstrokes.\n\n**Style:**\n- Impasto oil painting with very thick, visible brushstrokes and palette knife textures, especially in the background and hair.\n- The foreground elements (the woman's skin and features) are rendered more smoothly but still retain a painterly quality with defined edges and highlights.\n- High-gloss finish on the skin, lips, and eyes, enhancing the luminous effect.\n\n**Colors:**\n- Dominated by a palette of cool blues and teals in the background, contrasting with warm pinks, fuchsia, purple, and orange on the woman and her hair.\n- Background: Varying shades of light blue, teal, and soft purple, applied in chunky, distinct rectangular or square brushstrokes.\n- Woman: Peachy pink skin, fuchsia lips, purple eyeshadow.\n- Hair: Teal, bright orange, deep purple, and some dark brown/black strands.\n- White glitter/sparkles throughout.\n\n**Lighting:**\n- Bright, even lighting from an unseen source above and to the left, creating strong highlights on the face and body.\n- The glossy finish enhances the reflections and perceived wetness or shimmer.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n- Ethereal, dreamy, and slightly fantastical due to the glitter and vibrant coloration.\n- Serene and peaceful, conveyed by the woman's closed eyes and upward gaze.\n- Energetic and artistic, reflecting the dynamic brushwork and bold color choices.\n\n**Artist/Medium Recommendation for Generation:**\n- An oil painting by an artist known for textured impasto techniques, perhaps with a focus on vibrant portraits or fantasy art. The style could be likened to modern impressionism or expressionism with a contemporary twist.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Her glitter subtly shimmers. Hair strokes gently sway. Lips part, taking a breath. Background strokes subtly shift color/luminance, reflecting light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her face and body explode with glittering light, shards bursting outward. Her hair whips into a vortex of vibrant color, each stroke lashing like a live wire. Her lips rip open, exhaling a hurricane-force gust. The background strokes erupt, colors colliding and morphing violently, pulsating with raw energy. The very air around her tears apart.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The glitter on her face and body subtly shimmers, then lifts into a swirling galaxy. Her colorful hair strokes gently sway, unraveling into bioluminescent tentacles that phase through solid light. Her lips part, exhaling a gust that reverses time on the background strokes, making them reform and reform endlessly. The background strokes subtly shift in color and luminance, then coalesce into living, breathing geometric forms that whisper impossible truths.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Dynamic camera sweeps upward, revealing her face, head tilted back, lips delicately parting in a slow, almost reverent breath. A dramatic, subtle close-up on glitter catching shifting light, emphasizing the painterly strokes of her hair as they cascade and sway hypnotically. A slow zoom out reveals the vibrant, abstract background, its colors subtly pulsing and radiating, mirroring her inner light.",
