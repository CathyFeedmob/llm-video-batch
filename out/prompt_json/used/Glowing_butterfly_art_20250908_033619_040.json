    "video_prompt": "Shimmering particles subtly drift across the frame, with some concentrating around the butterfly. Gentle light streaks pulse and fade from behind the butterfly's wings. The transparent edges of the butterfly's wings softly ripple.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, ethereal butterfly with wings in a gradient of coral pink and light orange, outlined with delicate white lines. The tips of the lower wings transition to a bright, translucent blue. The butterfly's body is intricately detailed and glowing with intensity. Tiny, sparkling white particles emanate from the butterfly's body and wings, scattering outwards like dust. Streaks of light, ranging from bright orange to soft purple, radiate outward from behind the butterfly, creating a dynamic sense of motion and energy. The background is a dark, gradient purple, almost black in places, providing a stark contrast that makes the butterfly and lights pop. The lighting is strong and luminous, highlighting the translucence of the wings and the glowing effect. The overall atmosphere is magical, whimsical, and dreamlike. The composition is centered, with the butterfly as the main focal point, surrounded by the radiant light and particles, and with a logo \"c29\" in the bottom right corner with a white color.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle shimmers drift and concentrate around the butterfly. Light streaks pulse behind its wings. The transparent wing edges gently ripple.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Electric arcs explode from the butterfly's wings, tearing through the air. The shimmering particles coalesce into rapid, swirling vortexes around its body, then violently burst outwards like shrapnel. Light streaks transform into searing laser beams, slicing across the frame with aggressive precision. The butterfly's transparent wing edges contort and lash out, whipping with a violent, snapping motion, generating forceful gusts that ripple the entire background like liquid. The insect itself thrashes and pulsates with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The butterfly's wings shimmer with spectral light, causing light particles to defy gravity and spiral upwards, then coalesce into miniature cosmic nebulae that gently orbit the butterfly before collapsing into shimmering dust. The wings themselves become conduits of light, drawing in the nebulae as they grow increasingly translucent and ripple like water, transforming into ethereal portals to shifting, liquid dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms out from the shimmering butterfly, revealing its wings gently rippling amidst swirling, glowing particles. Light streaks pulse, casting ethereal glows on the translucent wing edges as the camera arc-sweeps around the majestic insect, enhancing its luminous form before fading to black.",
