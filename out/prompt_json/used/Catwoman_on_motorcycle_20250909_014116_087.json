    "video_prompt": "A female character on a motorcycle, dressed in a sleek suit and cat ears, raises a pistol while aiming. A giant full moon lights up the sky as the rain falls and reflects off the wet streets.\n\n**Movement prompt:**\n\n**Character:**\n- The woman blinks, and her eyes subtly shift, maintaining focus on her target.\n- Her chest rises and falls slightly with each breath.\n- Her hair gently sways and shifts as if caught in a subtle breeze.\n- The fabric of her suit subtly creaks and shifts with her movements.\n\n**Environment:**\n- The rain subtly falls and flows down the buildings and onto the street.\n- The water on the street gently ripples and glistens with the rain and reflections.\n- The lights from the buildings and cars subtly flicker and reflect on the puddles.\n- The headlights of the parked cars subtly dim and brighten.\n- A very subtle, slow zoom out, showcasing the vastness of the moon and cityscape.",
    "image_prompt": "A full-length vertical shot of a fierce, long red-haired woman in a sleek black leather catsuit, complete with black cat ear headbands and a black eye mask, perched on a powerful, custom-built motorcycle. She holds a handgun aimed directly at the viewer, her expression determined. The motorcycle is dark and futuristic, with prominent front and rear wheels, and its headlights glow softly.\n\nThe scene unfolds in a dark, atmospheric city street at night, with towering skyscrapers on either side, their windows glowing with warm light. A colossal full moon dominates the dark sky above, casting a luminous glow over the cityscape. The street is wet from recent rain, reflecting the city lights and the moonlight, creating a shimmering, almost ethereal effect. Distant cars are visible in the background, their headlights and taillights adding to the urban glow.\n\n**Composition:** Full-length, low-angle shot creates a powerful and dynamic perspective. The woman and motorcycle are centered, with the full moon positioned prominently behind her head. **Lighting:** Dramatic, with the bright moon as the primary light source illuminating the woman and motorcycle from behind, creating a silhouetted yet detailed effect. The city lights add warm ambient illumination to the sides and background. **Atmosphere:** Gritty, mysterious, and action-packed, evoking a neo-noir superhero or anti-hero feel. **Style:** Realistic with a touch of comic book or graphic novel aesthetic, focusing on sharp details and strong contrasts. **Colors:** Dominated by dark blues, grays, and blacks for the city and attire, contrasted with the bright white of the moon, the glowing red of her hair, and warm yellow/orange from city lights.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movement prompt:**\n\n**Character:**\n- Her hand fluidly raises the pistol, wrist subtly flexing.\n- Her head infinitesimally adjusts, eyes narrowing with intent.\n- Her breathing causes a rhythmic, subtle rise and fall of her shoulders.\n- The cat ears on her head twitch almost imperceptibly.\n\n**Environment:**\n- Raindrops individually strike and burst on the wet surfaces.\n- Reflections of the moon shimmer and ripple as the rain disturbs the water.\n- Distant building lights exhibit a gentle, natural flicker.\n- The entire scene undergoes a very slow, almost unnoticeable dolly zoom, expanding the sense of depth.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Character:**\n- The woman's head snaps sharply, eyes darting, pistol wildly twitching, then rapidly re-aims.\n- Her body lurches and contorts as the motorcycle violently twists beneath her.\n- Her hair violently whips around her face as if in a sudden gale.\n- Her suit rips and tears with the sudden, harsh movements.\n\n**Environment:**\n- The moon pulsates with an intense, otherworldly flicker, briefly elongating then contracting.\n- Buildings on either side violently lurch and settle, casting grotesque, shifting shadows.\n- Rain drops suddenly reverse course, shooting upwards from the puddles, then plummet again.\n- Headlights of parked cars flash erratically, then explode into blinding bursts of light.\n- The entire cityscape rapidly expands then contracts in a jarring, disorienting motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The massive moon slowly inverts, becoming a black void that absorbs cityscape lights, pulling them into its swirling depths. Her pistol morphs into a stream of flowing water, defying gravity to spell out an impossible message, then resolves into a flock of ethereal birds that take flight. Her suit morphs into a vibrant, living aurora borealis, expanding outward before contracting back into place. Puddles on the street swirl into miniature vortexes, reflecting impossible constellations that dance and shift. Her hair transforms into bioluminescent tendrils, intertwining with the light from the reflected void. The motorcycle’s tires slowly unravel into ribbons, wrapping around her legs as the street itself begins to ripple and fold like liquid.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The scene erupts! Rain intensifies, streaking down her gleaming suit. Her eyes, filled with fierce resolve, dart from target to gun. She aims, then dramatically fires, the muzzle flash momentarily illuminating the rainy street. The camera swoops back, revealing the full moon, then dramatically pushes in, emphasizing the impact on the glistening wet asphalt as the motorcycle subtly leans into motion. Light reflections dance wildly, highlighting her determined face.",
