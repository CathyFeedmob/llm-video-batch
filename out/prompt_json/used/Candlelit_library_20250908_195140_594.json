    "video_prompt": "Dust motes slowly drift through the candle light. Candles flicker gently, some occasionally dimming or brightening. Subtle glowing particles emanate from the central orb, slowly dispersing. The night sky visible through the central opening has very subtle, slow-moving nebulous clouds.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-angle, wide shot of an ornate, circular library, bathed in the soft, flickering light of hundreds of strategically placed candles. The library features multiple levels of curved wooden bookshelves, overflowing with ancient tomes, each layer accessible by winding staircases with intricate railings. A grand, broad staircase at the center leads upwards, also lined with numerous glowing candles, creating a path of light. At the very top, a large, glowing, mystical orb or moon-like object is visible through an open circular ceiling, illuminating the scene with an ethereal, bluish light. The overall atmosphere is dark, mysterious, and enchanting, with hints of a starry night sky visible through the upper openings. The dominant colors are warm browns and golds from the wood and candle flames, contrasted with cool blues and blacks of the night sky and the glowing orb, creating a dramatic sense of depth and scale.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Dust motes drift. Candles flicker, dim, and brighten. A central orb emits subtle, dispersing particles. Nebulous clouds drift in the night sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Candles violently flare, casting erratic, dancing shadows. Dust motes erupt into chaotic swirls. The central orb pulses with blinding, explosive light, sending shimmers of energy rocketing outwards. Bookshelves twist and contort, their contents shaking and rattling. The night sky churns, nebulae swirling like a furious maelstrom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Candles invert, drip light upwards, then morph into obsidian feathers fluttering to reverse-falling books. Motes condense into gleaming pearls that shimmer, then become miniature galaxies orbiting the central orb. The orb pulsates, sucking the distant nebulae inward, until the sky is a black hole filled with countless glowing eyes, winking out of existence.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Orbs of light pulse from the central sphere, scattering luminous dust motes that swirl and dance through flickering candlelight. A slow, sweeping camera ascends the grand staircase, revealing more intricate details of the ancient library, while soft wisps of nebulae drift across the night sky above, emphasizing the enchanting, otherworldly atmosphere.",
