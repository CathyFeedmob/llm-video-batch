    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A futuristic cityscape at dusk, dominated by towering, illuminated skyscrapers and sleek hovering vehicles.\n\n**Composition:** High-angle shot looking down a wide, multi-lane highway that curves into the distance, bustling with light trails from fast-moving traffic. Foreground shows rooftops of dense urban buildings, with the glowing highway as a central arterial. Skyscapers of varying heights fill the midground and background, some with dazzling digital facades. Several futuristic-looking, disc-shaped flying vehicles (UFOs/hovercraft) are scattered in the sky, adding dynamic movement. The overall perspective pulls the eye towards the distant horizon where the city thins into an atmospheric haze.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Buildings:** A mix of classic brick and modern glass skyscrapers. The most prominent skyscrapers feature massive, curved LED screens displaying vibrant, pixelated light patterns in blues, purples, and pinks. Other buildings have numerous small, glowing windows. Lower-level commercial buildings show illuminated storefronts and bright neon signs.\n*   **Vehicles:** Sleek, dark, metallic disc-shaped flying vehicles with bright orange/blue lights. The highway is filled with car light trails: red from taillights and white/pink from headlights, forming long blurs indicating speed.\n*   **Vegetation:** A scattering of street trees with illuminated canopies line the highway, and some greenery is visible on lower rooftops.\n*   **Lighting:** Predominantly artificial city lights casting a colorful glow. Prominent neon and LED lights on buildings. Headlights and taillights creating light trails. Subtle ambient light from the dusk sky.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Sci-fi, futuristic, bustling, energetic, vibrant, dynamic. A sense of technological advancement and modern urban life.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Sky:** Soft gradient of deep blue to warm purple/pink at the horizon, indicating dusk.\n*   **City Lights:** Dominant blues, purples, pinks from digital displays and neon signs. Warm yellow/orange from building windows and streetlights. Red and white/pink streaks from car lights.\n*   **Buildings:** Dark, reflective glass and concrete; warm reddish-brown brick in the foreground.\n*   **Vehicles:** Dark metallic with bright orange/blue accents.\n\n**Style:** Photorealistic, highly detailed, futuristic, urban, sci-fi concept art. Focus on light and reflection.\n\n**Overall Impression:** A captivating and immersive view of a high-tech metropolis, alive with light and movement, where futuristic transportation seamlessly integrates with a vibrant urban landscape at twilight. The composition emphasizes depth and the scale of the city.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle pulsation of urban lights; gentle drift of airborne objects; faint light trails from moving vehicles; slight shimmer on digital displays.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings buckle and shatter, screens erupting in blinding, chaotic light. UFOs dart and collide, plunging from the sky in fiery explosions. Highway lights strobe wildly, blurring into streaks of raw, furious energy. Neon street signs flicker violently, convulsing with untamed power. The entire city trembles, teetering on the edge of cataclysmic collapse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Buildings pulsate, breathing color outwards as their screens distort into rippling liquid. Saucers shimmer and stretch, morphing into feathered serpents, soaring backwards through the sky. Highway light trails coil and uncoil like luminous worms, sucking cars into their glowing vortexes. Neon signs melt and flow, painting the street with iridescent rivers. Architectural forms gently undulate, breathing a living, impossible cityscape.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "As dusk deepens, lights on futuristic skyscrapers flicker and pulsate with digital life, creating a mesmerizing ballet of color. Gleaming flying saucers drift gracefully between towering glass behemoths, their subtle movements hinting at an unseen purpose. A seamless camera pan reveals a sprawling highway below, where streaking light trails from vehicles paint the asphalt in vibrant hues. The grand, curved screens of the largest buildings shiver with a soft, ethereal glow, bathing the city in a futuristic aura. The camera slowly zooms outwards, revealing the vastness of this illuminated metropolis, leaving the viewer with a sense of wonder.",
