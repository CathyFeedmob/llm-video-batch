  "video_prompt": "**Prompt:** Eiffel Tower, blossoming with flowers, gradually changes its floral arrangement and density. Clouds drift and shift in the sky. People subtly move and coalesce around the distant Trocad\u00e9ro building, while those on the foreground path change positions.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Vibrant, vertical photograph of the Eiffel Tower adorned with dense clusters of colorful flowers (pink roses, white lilies, purple blossoms) against a bright blue sky with white clouds. The warm brown iron lattice work is central, with flowers emphasizing the lower and middle sections. Below, a lush green lawn with a walking path, dotted with tiny pink and white flowers, leads to a distant, large, light-colored building (Trocad\u00e9ro) and a crowd of people through the tower's arch. Landscaped hedges and conical evergreen bushes are also visible. A beautiful, lively springtime day in Paris. Subtle \"c29\" in the bottom right.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Floral adornments on a grand structure continuously shift, altering density and bloom. Clouds drift and reshape overhead. Distant figures subtly move, gathering and dispersing. Foreground individuals change positions, their movements fluid and varied."
