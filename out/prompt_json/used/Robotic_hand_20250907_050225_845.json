    "video_prompt": "Subtle blue light flickering within the translucent parts of the hand and the display, gears subtly rotating.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA highly detailed, realistic rendering of a translucent robotic hand, resembling a skeletal structure with transparent casing revealing internal mechanisms. The hand is in a slightly open, upward-facing pose, as if interacting with an unseen interface. The bones are depicted as smooth, off-white, slightly reflective elements, connected by advanced metallic joints with intricate circular patterns. Within the translucent casing, thin, glowing blue wires or conduits run alongside the bones, suggesting power or data flow.\n\nThe base of the palm and wrist area clearly shows multiple exposed gears of varying sizes, made of polished silver metal, with some gears subtly glowing with blue light from their centers, indicating active machinery. The overall aesthetic is scientific and futuristic.\n\nIn the upper right portion of the image, the index finger and thumb are curved as if interacting with a semi-transparent, luminous blue holographic display showing a graph or data grid. This display has a subtle glow radiating from its edges.\n\nThe background is a soft, dark gray or charcoal, with faint, out-of-focus blue bokeh lights scattered throughout, creating a shallow depth of field effect. The lighting is digital and crisp, with a cool, vibrant blue glow emanating from the internal elements of the hand and the holographic display, contrasting with the metallic and bone-like textures. The atmosphere is clean, high-tech, and contemplative. A small, stylized \"c29\" logo, rendered in a light blue outline, is visible in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Robotic hand, skeletal, translucent.\n*   **Materials:** Transparent casing, metallic joints, bone-like structures, glowing blue internal wires/conduits.\n*   **Mechanisms:** Exposed gears with internal blue glow.\n*   **Action/Interaction:** Hand interacting with a holographic data display.\n*   **Colors:** Dominant cool blues and grays, with off-white/silver accents.\n*   **Lighting:** Digital, crisp, glowing from internal elements and display.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Futuristic, high-tech, clean, scientific.\n*   **Composition:** Close-up to mid-shot, slight upward angle.\n*   **Detail:** High level of detail on joints, gears, and internal wiring.\n*   **Background:** Dark gray with subtle blue bokeh.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle blue light flickers within the hand and screen as gears gently rotate.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The mechanical hand *jerks* violently, fingers *snapping* back, then *lashing* forward to *tear* through the holographic display as gears *grind* furiously, scattering fragments of light. A *surge* of electric blue energy *explodes* from the wrist, causing the translucent bones to *pulse* and *flare* with blinding intensity. The surrounding space *warps* and *swirls* as the hand *convulses* with uncontrolled, chaotic power!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Chromatic bioluminescence pulsates from the hand's translucent bones, defying gravity as it drifts upwards. Gears at the wrist unravel into liquid silver, reforming into spectral butterflies that flutter around the hand. The holographic display ripples like water, its grid lines dissolving into swirling nebula, while time reverses within the display, projecting future possibilities that crumble into dust. Simultaneously, the hand's fingers stretch and curl like tendrils, attempting to grasp the fleeting visions, their tips becoming luminous energy conduits that dissolve objects upon contact.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic zoom begins from a tight shot of the metallic gears, subtly rotating with a soft blue luminescence. The camera dramatically pulls back, revealing the intricate translucent skeletal hand, its interior pipes glowing. As the hand slowly curls, a futuristic display pulsates on its palm. The camera sweeps around the hand, following the mesmerizing flicker of the blue light as it illuminates the surrounding darkness.",
