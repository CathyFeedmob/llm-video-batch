    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n*   A lone figure, seen from behind, standing perched on the edge of a tall, dilapidated urban rooftop.\n*   The figure is wearing a hooded, grungy, possibly worn or torn jacket/hoodie, and dark pants. The clothing has a distressed or post-apocalyptic feel with blotches or stains (like blood or dirt).\n*   The city spreads out below and around, a vast expanse of towering skyscrapers and buildings.\n*   The buildings are a mix of modern and older, some appearing somewhat rundown or grimy.\n*   A clear, bright, setting or rising sun is visible on the horizon, positioned near the highest skyscraper, casting a warm glow.\n*   In the foreground, a prominent, massive skyscraper stands tall to the right of the frame, skewed slightly, contributing to the feeling of immense height.\n*   In the mid-ground, a very tall, slender skyscraper with a prominent spire at its peak dominates the skyline, looking directly ahead of the figure.\n*   Distant buildings are shrouded in a hazy, atmospheric fog or smog, creating a sense of depth and mystery.\n\n**Composition:**\n\n*   Dramatic high-angle shot looking down onto the city.\n*   The figure is central and grounded on the rooftop at the bottom of the frame, providing a strong focal point.\n*   The large, angled skyscraper on the right forms a leading line upwards and slightly inwards.\n*   The central, tallest skyscraper draws the eye towards the horizon.\n*   Strong vertical lines from the buildings emphasize the height and scale.\n*   The overall composition creates a sense of awe, isolation, and contemplation.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   **Sky/Horizon:** Warm oranges, yellows, and reds from the sunset/sunrise.\n*   **Cityscape (General):** Dominant cool tones of deep blues, greys, and muted blacks for the buildings and atmospheric haze.\n*   **Building Lights:** Scattered warm yellow-orange lights emanating from windows, contrasting with the cool tones.\n*   **Figure:** Desaturated, muted earth tones for clothing (greys, tans, dirty whites), with hints of reddish-brown for the stains.\n*   **Rooftop:** Dark, rusted browns, greys, and blacks.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n*   **Global Illumination:** Backlit by the setting/rising sun, creating strong silhouettes and rim lighting on the figure and central buildings.\n*   **Shadows:** Long, dramatic shadows cast by buildings due to the low sun angle.\n*   **Internal Lights:** Glowing internal lights within the buildings create specular highlights and points of interest across the cityscape.\n*   **Atmospheric Haze:** A dense, bluish-grey atmospheric haze/fog fills the lower parts of the city, illuminated by ambient light and softening distant details.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Mood:** Solitary, contemplative, a bit desolate, epic, grand, gritty.\n*   **Feeling:** Overwhelming sense of height and scale, looking out over a vast urban landscape. There's a hint of melancholy or struggle suggested by the figure's appearance.\n*   **Weather:** Hazy, possibly foggy or smoggy, with a clear sky at the horizon where the sun is visible.\n\n**Style:**\n\n*   Hyperrealistic, cinematic, dystopian, post-apocalyptic, urban fantasy.\n*   Detailed rendering of textures (rust, concrete, glass, worn fabric).\n*   High dynamic range to capture both bright sun and deep shadows.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   Focus on the contrast between the warm sky and the cool, dark city.\n*   Emphasize the intricate details of the decaying rooftop surface.\n*   Ensure the figure's posture conveys a sense of stillness and observation.\n*   Add subtle details like distant city lights twinkling through the haze.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nSubtle camera pan-and-tilt, revealing distant city lights that shimmer and individual flickers. Faint, rising glowing particles drift through the city mist. The character's hoodie sways almost imperceptibly, responding to a light breeze. The ambient city glow subtly pulsates and shifts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Aggressive camera whips, violently panning and tilting! City lights explode then vanish; raw energy surges, shattering building glass upward! Skyscrapers contort, twisting into molten spires. The character's tattered hoodie ignites with black flame, ripping apart to reveal a pulsing, shadowy form, as the cityscape descends into chaotic, reality-bending oblivion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "As mist below unfurls, city lights morph into swirling constellations, drawing the character upwards with gravity-defying grace. Buildings liquify and stretch, reflecting impossibly shifting skies, while faint whispers of light dance into bioluminescent butterflies, carrying the character to a vanishing point beyond the sunset.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "\"Slow pan left across the sprawling, decaying cityscape, light flickering from distant windows, as a lone, cloaked figure stands precariously on a high-rise ledge. Mist rises, swirling around their feet. The camera then swiftly zooms out, revealing the dizzying drop below and the vast, forgotten world at twilight. A faint, almost imperceptible tremor shakes the building, subtly rocking the figure, as the camera subtly drops, hinting at the vastness of the chasm.\"",
