    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVertical double exposure photo, blue monochrome, white border with film perforation holes on left and right edges. The foreground is a profile silhouette of a young woman with short, wavy hair, looking left, her outline is softly blurred. Her silhouette is filled with an outdoor scene: a calm, dark blue body of water with subtle ripples reflecting light, a distant shoreline with dark trees and faint building outlines under a dark blue sky. The water fills the lower two-thirds of her form, transitioning to the sky and land above. The overall lighting creates a luminous glow around her silhouette against a bright, near-white background. Below the silhouette, on the right, large, textured white numbers \"C29\" are prominently displayed, with smaller white Chinese characters and a signature below them. The atmosphere is serene and dreamlike.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n* **Subject:** Profile silhouette of a young woman.\n* **Background within silhouette:** Outdoor scene with water, trees, and distant buildings.\n* **Overall background:** Bright, near-white, luminous.\n* **Text:** \"C29\" large, then smaller Chinese characters, then a signature.\n* **Frame:** White border with film perforations (sprocket holes) on the side edges.\n\n**Style:**\n* **Double exposure photography:** Clear overlap of two distinct images.\n* **Monochromatic:** Primarily blue tones.\n* **Silhouette:** Subject defined by its dark outline against a bright background.\n* **Dreamlike/Serene:** Soft edges, calm water, ethereal feel.\n\n**Composition:**\n* **Vertical Orientation:** Portrait aspect ratio.\n* **Central Placement:** The silhouette of the woman is centrally placed, occupying most of the vertical space.\n* **Rule of Thirds (implicit):** The woman's head is roughly in the top third, her body fills the middle, and the text is in the lower right.\n* **Symmetrical Framing:** Film perforations on both sides.\n\n**Colors:**\n* **Dominant Blue:** Deep to light blue tones for the silhouette fill and the dark area of the border.\n* **Bright White:** For the main background and text.\n* **Subtle Dark:** Very dark blue/black for distinct elements within the silhouette like trees and building outlines.\n\n**Lighting:**\n* **Backlighting:** Strong light coming from behind the subject, creating the silhouette effect.\n* **Soft, Diffused:** No harsh shadows, lending to the dreamlike quality.\n* **Luminous Glow:** A pronounced glow around the edges of the silhouette and the film frame.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n* **Calm:** Gentle water, still scene.\n* **Mysterious/Introspective:** The silhouette invites contemplation.\n* **Ethereal/Dreamy:** Achieved through the double exposure, soft light, and monochrome palette.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Faint ripples spread across the water's surface, reflecting a subtle shimmer. The silhouette's hair sways gently with the unseen breeze.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive water surges, violently morphing into roaring whirlpools! Hair whips into a furious tempest, silhouette tears apart, revealing a cityscape consumed by a chaotic, living current. Buildings twist, shatter, and rebuild with impossible speed. Fire erupts, consumed and reborn in a demonic dance. Everything shimmers, pulses, and detonates with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A faint shimmering on the water’s surface, with slight ripples spreading gently, defying gravity to climb the silhouette's hair, which sways backward, pulling the water with it as it etherealises into swirling nebulae. The image then phases through a liquid-metal mirror, distorting the scene into kaleidoscopic fractals as the silhouette's form slowly dissipates into glistening cosmic dust, revealing a swirling vortex behind it.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The ethereal silhouette of a figure, side profile, emerges as the camera slowly pulls back, revealing a faint shimmer on the water’s surface with gentle ripples expanding. The wind, unseen but felt, subtly sways the person's hair, a whisper of dramatic tension. As the camera fluidly tracks right, the silhouetted figure begins to slowly turn, almost imperceptibly, revealing more of the vibrant, rippling water and distant, indistinct structures, hinting at a larger mystery.",
