    "video_prompt": "A subtle camera pan follows the main aircraft, with its propeller spinning and a slight wobble as it banks. Water ripples and splashes around the battleship below, which also shows a slight bobbing motion. Smoke from the burning aircraft in the distance drifts gently, and small embers flicker. The pilot's chest subtly rises and falls, indicating breathing, and their ears have a faint twitch.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA high-stakes aerial combat scene from the cockpit point of view. A rabbit pilot, wearing a brown leather flight helmet with goggles and a beige flight suit, is intently flying a vintage propeller-driven fighter plane. The interior of the cockpit is detailed, showing instruments and controls. Directly in front of the pilot's plane, another identical fighter plane is in motion, its propeller blades blurred by speed. Below, a large, grey battleship or heavy cruiser, armed with multiple gun turrets, cuts through choppy dark blue ocean waters, leaving a white wake. In the distance, smoke billows from an explosion on another distant plane, and a third small plane is visible. The sky is a muted, overcast light blue, with soft light filtering through. The overall atmosphere is tense and action-packed, with a slightly desaturated, painterly art style, echoing the golden age of flying. Cinematic wide-angle perspective.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera subtly pans, propeller spinning, aircraft banking with a slight wobble. Water ripples and splashes around the bobbing battleship. Smoke drifts gently from the distant burning aircraft, embers flickering. Pilot's chest rises and falls, ears subtly twitch.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The main aircraft violently wrenches sideways, propeller blurring into a vortex. The battleship below abruptly lurches, cannons swiveling erratically as massive waves erupt. Flaming debris from distant aircraft explodes mid-air, showering sparks. The pilot's chest violently heaves, and ears snap wildly, twitching with uncontrolled ferocity as the cockpit violently vibrates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The plane, now a sentient cloud, weeps rain that forms an upside-down ocean. The battleship's cannons sprout wings, flying backward to assemble mid-air. The pilot's ears transform into miniature, glowing galaxies, slowly orbiting their head, as the distant, burning aircraft rewinds into an egg-like state, absorbing its smoke.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "*Low-angle, sweeping drone shot reveals a battleship on choppy waters.\n*Quick pan upward to a damaged fighter, fire consuming the engine.\n*Sudden, tight zoom on the rabbit pilot, chest heaving, ears twitching nervously.\n*Cut to a distant explosion illuminating the cloudy sky.\n*Slow, intentional pull-back reveals the rabbit's plane, banking precariously.\n*The camera follows as it barely misses the water.\n*Quick cut to a wide shot of the rabbit's shaking hand on the throttle.",
