    "video_prompt": "Hair gently sways and shifts as if underwater. The shimmering liquid spirals slowly rotate and drift. The silver jewelry subtly clinks and light reflections dance across its surface. The character's eyes softly blink, and their chest shows a faint breathing motion. Tiny, almost imperceptible droplets of water occasionally appear and dissipate around the spirals and the character. A very subtle camera push-in zooms in slightly on the character.",
    "image_prompt": "A full-body digital painting of a youthful East Asian woman with dark hair styled in twin pigtails that flow dynamically, set against a stark, light background. She is captured in a squatting pose, leaning slightly forward, with her gaze directed towards the viewer.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** Young East Asian woman.\n*   **Hair:** Long, dark, possibly black or very dark blue, styled in two high pigtails. The pigtails are dynamic and flowing, possibly indicating movement or an ethereal quality, with some strands tinted teal/blue. Red ties secure the pigtails. Loose strands frame her face.\n*   **Eyes:** Piercing light blue or teal eyes, conveying alertness and a slight intensity.\n*   **Facial Features:** Soft yet determined expression.\n*   **Attire:** She wears a vibrant, multi-layered dress or tunic. The top layer appears to be a shimmering gold or yellow with intricate patterns, possibly brocade, over a rich red undergarment or skirt. The red fabric appears draped and flowing, reaching down to her ankles or feet.\n*   **Jewelry:** Prominent and ornate silver jewelry, characteristic of traditional ethnic designs, adorns her:\n    *   A large, layered neckpiece or torque with multiple dangling motifs and fringes.\n    *   Matching long earrings.\n    *   Silver rings on several fingers of her left hand.\n*   **Accessories:**\n    *   Black arm guards or bracers on both forearms, with metallic silver accents and possibly red highlights.\n    *   Dark, possibly leather, sandals or simple flat shoes exposing her toes.\n*   **Body Markings:** A reddish, stylized circular tattoo or mark is visible on her upper right arm.\n*   **Surroundings/Background:** A minimalist, bright, almost white or very light gray background. Scattered around her are large, translucent, swirling, and droplet-like forms that resemble water or crystal-clear glass, reflecting light and creating visual interest. Some smaller water droplets are also present on the ground and her skin.\n\n**Style:**\nDigital painting with a semi-realistic, slightly illustrative or anime-influenced aesthetic. Sharp details, particularly in the jewelry and facial features, combined with soft blends for skin tones and flowing hair.\n\n**Composition:**\nFull shot of the woman positioned centrally, squatting low. Her dynamic hair curves upwards and outwards, framing her head against the light background. The swirling glass/water elements are strategically placed to create a sense of depth and movement around her. Her left hand is extended forward, fingers slightly spread, hinting at interaction with the ground or the viewer.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are rich reds, shimmering gold/yellow, dark black/teal for hair, vibrant silver for jewelry, and pale, luminous skin tones. The background is predominantly light and clean, making the figure stand out. The translucent swirls add cool blue and white tones.\n\n**Lighting:**\nBright, soft, and even lighting from above, highlighting the reflective surfaces of her jewelry, the fabric she wears, and the glass-like elements. There are subtle shadows underneath her and around the objects, giving them dimension. The translucent elements show refraction and highlights.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nMysterious, strong, and somewhat ethereal or graceful. There's a sense of elegance and traditional power, possibly with a hint of fantasy or ancient folklore due to the attire and jewelry. The clear, swirling elements add a magical or fluid quality.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle hair sway as if underwater. Shimmering liquid spirals slowly rotate and drift. Silver jewelry subtly clinks, reflecting dancing light. Soft eye blinks and faint chest breathing. Imperceptible water droplets appear/dissipate. Gentle camera push-in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Hair whips violently, lashing like serpents as it coils and snaps around the character. Shimmering liquid spirals shatter explosively into razor-sharp shards, orbiting erratically. Silver jewelry rips across the character, clashing and glinting with violent, strobing reflections. Eyes snap open, pupils dilating, jaw clenches. The chest heaves with forceful, desperate gasps. Deluges of water surge and explode, forming chaotic whirlpools that drag the character under as the camera plunges into the abyss.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Hair, a black aurora borealis, defies gravity, swirling upwards against reverse-flowing time. Shimmering liquid spirals shatter into crystalline shards, then reform as abstract eyes that blink in unison with the character. Silver jewelry, now fluid, ripples and drips upward, transforming into ephemeral butterflies that flutter into consciousness. Character's eyes, portals to shimmering galaxies, rotate independently, while their breath creates miniature black holes that swallow and regurgitate light. Water droplets, sentient and glowing, dance in impossible geometries, forming transient constellations around the dream-like figure as the camera pushes into an endless loop of self-reflection.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera subtly pushes in on the character.\nHair dramatically billows.\nShimmering liquid spirals dynamically dance and coalesce around the character.\nSilver jewelry glints, catching the light as the character almost imperceptibly shifts their weight.\nEyes intensely hold the viewer's gaze, a barely discernible blink.\nTiny, ephemeral water droplets burst and reform, emphasizing the surreal atmosphere.",
