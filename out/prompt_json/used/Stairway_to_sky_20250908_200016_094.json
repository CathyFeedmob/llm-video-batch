    "video_prompt": "A subtle breeze rustles the clouds on the left. The distant figure slightly shifts its weight. Fine dust motes drift upwards from the steps. Slight swaying of wires stretched between buildings.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA monochromatic, ink-sketched illustration with subtle, muted watercolor washes of sky blue and sepia-toned building facades. The composition features a dramatic, low-angle perspective looking up a long, steep, dilapidated wooden staircase in a narrow alleyway. The alley is flanked on both sides by tall, ramshackle, weathered wooden buildings with multiple levels, creating an oppressive verticality and a feeling of enclosure.\n\nAt the very top of the endless staircase, a small, solitary human figure stands silhouetted against a bright, clear blue sky, appearing distant and tiny. The stairs themselves are worn and uneven, with visible wooden planks and debris. On the right side, the buildings have overhanging roofs and visible window structures outlined in dark ink. The overall texture is rough, with speckles and variations resembling aged paper or concrete, particularly on the lighter areas and borders.\n\nThe style is reminiscent of a detailed comic book panel or graphic novel illustration, with strong black linework defining shapes and shadows, creating a sense of depth and form. Light is coming from above, illuminating the sky and subtly highlighting the top of the staircase. The atmosphere is quiet, contemplative, and slightly melancholic, emphasizing solitude and the journey ahead. A faint, smudged white-blue cloud effect appears on the left side, blending into the rough paper texture. Japanese kanji characters are subtly present vertically on the bottom left, and \"C29\" horizontally on the bottom right corner, suggesting a signature or page number.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Left clouds subtly ripple. Distant figure subtly sways. Dust motes gently ascend stairs. Building wires gently oscillate.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Wham! Gale force winds rip skyward, whipping clouds into a vortex! The lone figure, a silent sentinel, explodes into a blur of motion, leaping across the chasm. Dust motes erupt into a shimmering, upward-spiraling tornado. Wires between buildings snap taut, crackling with raw energy as the very structures groan, buckle, and twist, threatening to implode under immense, invisible strain!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The clouds on the left shimmer and coalesce into a spectral hand, gently pulling the distant figure upwards, defying gravity. Fine dust motes reverse their course, spiraling down the steps, leaving shimmering trails. Wires between buildings twist and braid into living tendrils, pulsating with ethereal light as they intertwine, forming impossible knots. The very air around the stairs ripples like water, distorting the scene in a mesmerizing, fluid dance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A gentle camera push-in towards the steps. As the breeze lifts, a cloud on the left expands subtly. A slow dolly zoom exaggerates the distant figure's weight shift. Dust motes dramatically swirl and dance upwards, catching a glint of light. Slight, unsettling swaying of wires adds a suspenseful rhythm.",
