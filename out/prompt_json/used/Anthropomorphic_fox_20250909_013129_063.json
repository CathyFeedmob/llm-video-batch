    "video_prompt": "The fox's ears subtly twitch and rotate, while its fluffy tail gently sways. The colorful ribbons hanging from its arm and waist flutter softly in an imperceptible breeze. The thin papers of the fan in its hand gently ripple. A subtle glimmer catches on the brass bells, and the fabric of its robe ripples slightly as if with a deep, slow breath. The background foliage in the upper left and lower left gently rustles. The faint smoke or mist in the distant background softly drifts.",
    "image_prompt": "A full body shot of a charming, anthropomorphic fox character in a vivid, illustrative style. The fox, with its sleek reddish-orange fur and prominent white muzzle, is dressed in a traditional, martial arts-inspired outfit. Its attire consists of a dark blue, loose-fitting robe over a light gray inner garment, cinched at the waist with a deep red sash and complex interwoven ropes. Colorful, thin ribbons of blue, green, orange, and purple dangle from below its left wrist. On its right wrist, a colorful, patterned armlet is visible. Long, ornate earrings with turquoise and red beads hang from its ears, and a multi-strung beaded necklace with a prominent brass bell adds to its mystic charm.\n\nThe fox holds a light-brown paper fan, beautifully decorated with subtle calligraphy and illustrations, in its left hand. Its right hand grasps a small, light-brown cloth satchel, and a chain of two white garlic bulbs hangs from its waist, adding an intriguing detail. A voluminous, bushy fox tail with rich orange fur and a bright white tip is visible on the right side of the image.\n\nThe character stands against a backdrop featuring a traditional East Asian temple or building with a dark-tiled roof and intricate architectural details. The sky above is a moody, overcast gray. The overall lighting is dim and atmospheric, with soft, diffused light highlighting the character. The composition emphasizes the character, with the building serving as a majestic yet receding background element. Subtle textures and brushstrokes contribute to the stylized, painterly aesthetic. The image evokes a sense of journey, mystery, and traditional Asian folklore.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The fox's tail dramatically whips side to side, fur bristling as it lunges forward. Ribbons violently snap and unfurl, instantly elongating and twisting into tendrils. The fan rips open, papers wildly flailing and tearing. Bells violently clang and burst into a cascade of molten brass. The robe erupts, billowing into a swirling vortex of fabric. The distant building shatters, fragments exploding outward as a gigantic, fiery fox spirit bursts forth. The mist churns into a raging storm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fox's ears elongate into ethereal ribbons, phasing through the fan as it distorts into a swirling galaxy. The tail detaches, becoming a shimmering ouroboros. Ribbons pulsate, detaching to orbit the fox like sentient stardust. Bells chime backward, pulling the robe to unravel into blooming flowers. Background foliage dissolves into liquid light, and the mist solidifies into floating geometric inversions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The scene opens with a slow zoom into the fox's piercing eyes, the fan in its hand slowly unfurling to reveal a hidden symbol. As the fan ripples, a gust of wind dramatically lifts the ribbons, and the bells jingle ominously. A quick pan follows the bushy tail as it lashes out, then a rapid zoom as the background mist swirls, hinting at a hidden threat. The fox's robe billows, revealing a knife tucked into its belt, before a final shot of its face, a sly grin forming, as thunder rolls in the distance.",
