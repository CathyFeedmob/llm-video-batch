    "video_prompt": "Rain gently falls, glistening on the leaves and pavement. A figure walks with an umbrella, their silhouette reflected in the shimmering puddles. Distant streetlights subtly flicker, casting warm, distorted reflections that dance on the wet surface. Reflections of trees and buildings ripple gently with the movement of water.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA low-angle, full vertical shot of a wet, reflective urban sidewalk on a rainy day, leading towards a person holding a white umbrella walking away from the viewer. The perspective emphasizes the shimmering reflections of warm streetlights on the rain-slicked ground, creating elongated vertical streaks of bright orange and yellow light. A line of classic black streetlamps with glowing yellow lights runs along the left side of the street, amidst lush green trees with dark bark. On the right, a building with large glass windows and multiple wall-mounted sconce lights casts warm light onto the pavement. The overall atmosphere is serene and slightly moody, with visible raindrops in the air. The color palette is dominated by dark greys, deep greens, and vibrant warm oranges and yellows from the lights, contrasted with touches of blue on the person's jacket and the white umbrella. The composition uses leading lines from the sidewalk to draw the eye towards the figure, and the reflections create a strong sense of depth and visual interest. The background shows urban buildings fading into the mist. A white logo text \"c29\" is subtly placed in the bottom right corner of the image, appearing as if painted on the wet surface.\n\n**Key visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere broken down:**\n\n*   **Visual Elements:** Wet urban sidewalk, person with white umbrella, classic black streetlamps, lush green trees, building with large glass windows and sconce lights, raindrops, reflections.\n*   **Style:** Realistic, photographic, slightly cinematic, reflective.\n*   **Composition:** Low-angle perspective, full vertical shot, strong leading lines from the sidewalk, rule of thirds applied to the figure's placement, emphasis on foreground reflections, balanced elements on left and right.\n*   **Colors:** Dominant dark greys and blacks (sidewalk, streetlamps, building), vibrant greens (trees), warm yellow/orange (lights and reflections), subtle blue (jacket), white (umbrella, logo).\n*   **Lighting:** Predominantly artificial light from multiple sources (streetlamps, sconces) creating strong, warm reflections on wet surfaces. Diffused natural light from the overcast sky. Visible light rays and bokeh in reflections where focus drops off.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Rainy, calm, serene, moody, reflective, urban, inviting.\n*   **Additional Details:** Visible texture of wet pavement, subtle city background, sharp focus on foreground reflections and nearby elements, slight blur/softness in background to enhance depth. The \"c29\" logo is integrated into the wet texture of the ground.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Gentle rain creates rhythmic ripples on puddles. A figure's umbrella bobs, their reflected silhouette elongating and shortening with each step. Distant streetlights flicker, their distorted reflections wavering and stretching across the wet ground. Reflected trees and buildings subtly undulate with water movement.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent downpour explodes, lashing trees into a frenzy. Streetlights ignite, their reflections not flickering but twisting, contorting into grotesque faces in the surging puddles. The lone figure's umbrella rips apart, sending them reeling as the pavement itself shudders and warps. Buildings writhe, glass shards exploding as their reflections shatter and reform into monstrous shapes. Water defies gravity, forming roaring vortexes as the very air crackles with untamed energy, consuming everything in a chaotic dance of destruction.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Raindrops rise, morphing into fireflies that dance and form the umbrella. The figure's reflection detaches, walking backward into the warped streetlights, which pulsate with inverted colors. Trees on the sidewalk melt into liquid light, flowing upwards into the sky as spectral buildings ripple into existence on their trunks. The pavement shimmers, revealing glimpses of a cosmic ocean beneath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone figure, umbrella raised, strides through a downpour. TRACKING SHOT from low angle, capturing glistening wet pavement and blurred streetlights. SUDDEN PUSH IN to their silhouette reflected in a swirling puddle, light fractured and dancing. PULL BACK SLOWLY as they near a vibrant streetlight, its warm glow illuminating the gentle, continuous rain.",
