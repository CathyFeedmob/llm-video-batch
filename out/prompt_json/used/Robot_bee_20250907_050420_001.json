    "video_prompt": "Subtle wing flapping with internal gear rotation, slight antennae twitch, gentle leg articulation.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, photorealistic 3D render of a robotic bee in a steampunk style. The bee's body is primarily shiny emerald green, accented with segments of gold and black on its abdomen. Its head features large, dark, reflective compound eyes and small, delicate antennae with spherical tips. The body is intricately designed with visible gears, rivets, and piston-like joints made of a polished bronze or copper material, giving it a mechanical yet elegant appearance. Transparent, light blue wings with visible bronze or copper veins extend from its back, catching the light. The bee's six legs are segmented, green, and also articulated with bronze/copper joints, ending in small, claw-like feet.\n\nThe lighting is soft and even, highlighting the metallic sheen and details of the robot bee. The background is a dark, gradient grey-black, providing a stark contrast that makes the vibrant colors of the bee stand out. The bee is positioned slightly to the left of the frame, facing forward and slightly downwards, as if in mid-flight or poised on an invisible surface. Its posture suggests readiness or gentle movement. The atmosphere is clean and precise, emphasizing the intricate craftsmanship of the robotic insect. There is a subtle depth of field where the closest parts of the bee are in sharp focus, and the furthest parts become slightly softer.\n\n**Composition:** Close-up shot, slightly elevated eye-level.\n**Colors:** Emerald green, polished gold, deep black, bronze/copper, transparent light blue.\n**Lighting:** Soft, studio lighting, highlighting metallic and reflective surfaces.\n**Atmosphere:** Futuristic, elegant, precise, industrial yet natural.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Robotic bee lunges forward violently, wings tearing through air with a loud crack, gears grind and sparks fly as it propels itself with explosive force. Antennae snap, legs thrash, body shakes with overwhelming power.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "**Impossible video prompt:**\n\nGlass wings sprout iridescent feathers, phasing through the robot's metallic body. Gears unwind into bubbling magma, then solidify into ticking clockwork flowers. Legs invert, spiraling into ethereal light, pulling the bee-bot upwards as gravity flips, landing softly on the ceiling of a nebula, its antennae conducting impossible symphonies.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Video Prompt:**\n\nA dramatic close-up, revealing intricate internal gears rotating within the emerald body of the bee. The camera slowly pulls back, showcasing subtle wing flutters as a singular antenna twitches. A sudden, sweeping motion reveals the bee in mid-flight, legs subtly articulating, amidst an ethereal glow hinting at a mysterious energy source. The focus sharpens, capturing a brief, surprising mid-air somersault before the bee elegantly resumes its flight path, leaving a faint, shimmering trail. Dramatic lighting shifts, emphasizing its regal metallic sheen.",
