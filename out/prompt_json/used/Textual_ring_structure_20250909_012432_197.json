    "image_prompt": "A digital art image forming a large, intricate, ring-shaped structure, reminiscent of a circular data center or a futuristic cityscape. The structure is predominantly dark grey and black, with numerous protruding blocks and layers that have white or light grey alphanumeric characters and symbols printed on their surfaces, creating a stark contrast. These characters appear to be gibberish or heavily stylized.\n\nThe structure is viewed from a low angle, looking up and slightly into the central void of the ring, giving a sense of immense scale. The central void is bright white, suggesting light coming from behind or within. The overall impression is one of complexity, information overload, and a stylized, dystopian, or cyberpunk aesthetic. The background outside the ring is plain white, highlighting the structure. On the bottom right, there are some small, dark characters that appear to be Chinese text, and likely the alphanumeric \"C29\". The image suggests a 3D rendered artwork.\n\n**Visual elements:**\n* Intricate, ring-shaped structure made of dark grey/black blocks.\n* Alphanumeric characters and symbols in white/light grey adorning the surfaces of the blocks.\n* Central bright white void within the ring.\n* Chinese text characters and \"C29\" at the bottom right.\n\n**Style:**\n* Digital rendering, 3D art.\n* Futuristic, dystopian, cyberpunk, or data-driven aesthetic.\n* Highly detailed and complex.\n\n**Composition:**\n* Tilted, low-angle shot, looking into the ring's void.\n* The ring fills a significant portion of the frame, leading the eye towards the bright center.\n* Asymmetrical balance, with more of the structure visible on the left and bottom.\n\n**Colors:**\n* Monochromatic, primarily dark grey, black, and white.\n* High contrast between the dark structure and light text/background/central void.\n\n**Lighting:**\n* Appears to be illuminated from behind or within the central void, creating strong silhouettes and highlighting the white text.\n* Some subtle reflections on the surfaces of the blocks.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n* Mysterious, complex, and slightly overwhelming.\n* Evokes themes of data, technology, and information.\n\n**Prompt (concise for image generation):**\nA highly detailed 3D digital rendering of a colossal, intricate ring-shaped structure, made of dark grey and black interlocking blocks and layers. The surfaces of these blocks are covered in dense patterns of white, stylized alphanumeric characters and symbols, resembling a futuristic data center or a city of information. The perspective is a low-angle shot looking up and into the bright white void at the center of the ring, creating a strong contrast. The background is pure white. The artwork has a strong, high-contrast, monochromatic aesthetic, inspired by cyberpunk and dystopian architecture. Some subtle reflective qualities on the block surfaces. --ar 9:16",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom out reveals a slow-rotating alphanumeric cylinder. Light from its central void subtly pulses, dynamically shadowing intricate word formations.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive camera whip-pans as the alphanumeric cylinder SHATTERS outward, shards of letters morphing into a whirlwind vortex. The central void violently implodes, unleashing a blinding energy pulse that warps the fragmented structure. Letters writhe and contort, reforming into impossible, self-devouring shapes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The alphanumeric cylinder, impossibly, unspools outwards, its letters stretching like taffy, revealing an infinity of hidden characters within each one. The central void exhales geometric light, simultaneously solidifying and dissolving the structure. As letters detach and orbit like ephemeral cosmic dust, the cylinder inverts its internal space, revealing a kaleidoscopic, non-euclidean interior where shadows shimmer like liquid silver, and time itself unravels into pure light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Dramatic camera pull-back on a colossal alphanumeric cylinder, slowly revealing its intricate, rotating form. As the camera circles, the void pulses with an ethereal glow, casting flickering shadows that dance across the structured letters. A final, sweeping move unveils the structure silhouetted against a stark, white backdrop, emphasizing its monumental scale.",
