    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer on the whale's body in the moonlight. Gentle undulation of the large whale's fins and tail. Whisps of cloud drift across the moons. Faint glow from windows in the spires. Subtle particle flow within the light beam. Smaller whales glide slowly.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFantasy artwork depicting an otherworldly cityscape beneath a vibrant sky. Dominating the upper center is a colossal, dark blue manta ray-like creature with glowing eyes, its body emitting a strong, surreal blue light beam downwards. Above and slightly to the left of the creature, a large, brilliant full moon glows, with two smaller, fainter moon-like orbs in the deep blue sky. The sky transitions from a dark, deep blue at the top to warm, fiery oranges and reds at the horizon, with dramatic, wispy clouds scattered throughout. Below the horizon line, countless colossal, gothic-inspired towers and spires of a dark, ancient city stretch into the distance, some appearing partially submerged in a murky, dark blue liquid or mist that fills the lower half of the scene. Several smaller dark blue whales and manta ray-like creatures gracefully swim through the sky and among the city's spires, some close to the light beam. The overall atmosphere is mystical, epic, and slightly foreboding. The lighting is dramatic, with strong contrasts between the bright moon and light beam and the dark city and creatures. The art style is painterly with a touch of digital realism, showcasing intricate details on the creatures and architecture.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Overall Theme:** Fantasy, otherworldly, mystical, epic.\n*   **Main Subject:** Colossal manta ray-like creature at top, emitting light.\n*   **Supporting Subjects:** Smaller flying whales/manta rays, gothic cityscape.\n*   **Sky/Celestial:** Large full moon, two smaller moons, deep blue to fiery orange/red gradient sky, wispy clouds.\n*   **Atmosphere/Environment:** Murky dark blue liquid/mist at the bottom, partially submerging the city.\n*   **Colors:** Dominant deep blues, dark grays/blacks (city), bright yellows/whites (moon/light), fiery oranges/reds (sky).\n*   **Lighting:** Strong contrast, bioluminescent light from main creature, ethereal glow from moons, subtle light from city windows.\n*   **Composition:** Vertical orientation, main creature in upper center, moon behind it, city filling the lower frame, sense of depth and scale.\n*   **Style:** Painterly, digital art, realistic textures for creatures, detailed gothic architecture.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer on the whale's body in moonlight. Gentle undulations of fins and tail. Wisps of clouds drift across moons. Faint glow **pulsates** from windows. Subtle particle flow **swirls** within light beam. Smaller whales glide slowly **in and out of view**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Whale erupts from water, bioluminescent shimmer exploding across its body. Its fins and tail thrash violently, sending chaotic waves throughout the scene. Moons pulsate with raw energy, unleashing a torrent of lightning onto the spires. Buildings groan and twist, their foundations cracking as glowing windows shatter. The light beam pulsates erratically, shooting out aggressive, swirling particles. Smaller whales dart and dive with unnatural speed, their forms blurring in a whirlwind of terror.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Lunar whales' light beams siphon liquid spires, causing them to ripple and dissolve into starry dust. Smaller whales, glowing with internal luminescence, swim through melting cloud-moons, leaving shimmering trails that reform into crystalline structures before collapsing into vortexes. A giant whale's fins and tail undulate, not propelling it, but warping reality, stretching the sky into ribbons of impossible color.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A colossal, luminous whale descends slowly, its fins undulating gently. The camera smoothly tracks its majestic movement as tiny, glowing particles cascade from its form, illuminating the ethereal fog below. Smaller whales gracefully circle gothic spires as moonlight drifts across the alien landscape. A single shaft of light connects the leviathan to the city, pulsating softly to the rhythmic beat of the water.",
