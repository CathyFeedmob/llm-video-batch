    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Visual Elements & Subject:** A heartwarming and comedic scene featuring two anthropomorphic cats. The foreground features a small, orange tabby kitten, appearing distressed and crying with prominent blue tears, wearing a yellow headscarf and holding a red pencil, deeply focused on a workbook. Behind and slightly to the right, a larger, light grey tabby cat, appearing as an adult figure, stands with a stern, angry expression, mouth open in a shout, wearing a green headscarf and a white apron over a green skirt-like garment. Both cats have large, expressive eyes; the kitten's are green with a hint of red, and the adult's are vibrant green. Stylized white lightning bolt symbols emanate from the adult cat, indicating anger or intensity.\n\n**Composition:** Medium close-up shot, slightly from above. The kitten is prominently in the lower-left to mid-left, drawing the eye, while the adult cat fills the mid-right to upper-right, creating a diagonal dynamic. The wooden desk surface occupies the lower half, displaying school supplies like an open workbook with scribbles, several pencils, a red and blue pencil case, an eraser, and another small, white paper object. The background is blurred, showing a warm interior classroom or study setting with hints of a window frame and framed pictures on a light green wall.\n\n**Style:** High-quality 3D render in a cute, animated, and slightly exaggerated cartoon style reminiscent of Pixar or DreamWorks. Soft, plush fur textures with detailed whiskers. The characters have oversized heads and expressive facial features.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant warm tones: oranges, yellows, and browns from the kitten and desk. Contrasted by cool greens from the adult cat's attire and the background wall. White and blue accents for the apron, tears, and lightning bolts. Natural, muted palette overall.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused, warm lighting suggestive of natural light coming from a window (implied to the left). Subtle highlights on the fur and pencils. The lighting creates a gentle, inviting atmosphere despite the adult cat's anger.\n\n**Atmosphere:** A mix of stress and care. The primary feeling is the younger cat's struggle with schoolwork and the older cat's frustrated attempt to teach or motivate. Has a slight comedic undertone due to the exaggerated expressions.\n\n**Additional details:** The bottom right includes a handwritten-style signature \"c29\" in white script with an apostrophe.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom out. Stern cat's whiskers twitch. Crying cat's tears drip and pool. Pages of open book subtly ruffle. Window light gently shifts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Static (Start):** The stern cat's whiskers twitch slightly, the crying cat's tears drip.\n\n**Dynamic (End):** Suddenly, the crying cat's tears explode into a gushing torrent, pages erupt from the book, swirling like a tornado. The stern cat's apron rips open to reveal blazing eyes. Pencil box leaps off the table, pencils catapult into the air like missiles. Wind howls, ripping through the room, bending the window frame inward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A subtle camera zoom out, the stern cat's whiskers morphing into shimmering icicles and snapping upwards defying gravity, the crying cat's tears solidifying into floating pearls that ascend, the open book's pages ripple like water, transforming into ethereal feathers that flutter away, and the window light bends and warps into a kaleidoscope of impossible colors.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Camera subtly zooms out as the stern cat's whiskers twitch, a shadow cast across her face. The crying cat's tears glisten, slowly dripping and forming small, shimmering pools on the open book. A gentle breeze from the window causes the pages to subtly ruffle, catching the light as it softly shifts, illuminating the cats' varying emotions in a quiet, poignant moment.",
