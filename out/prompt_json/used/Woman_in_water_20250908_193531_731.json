    "video_prompt": "A woman stands in a river during autumn. Subtle ripples spread as she slightly shifts weight. A gentle breeze causes her hair strands and dress to subtly sway. The flame she holds flickers softly, casting dancing light reflections on the water's surface. Autumn leaves gently fall from trees and drift on the water's currents. The overall camera slowly zooms out.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVibrant, painterly digital art illustration of a young woman standing submerged in water in a serene autumn forest setting. She faces away from the viewer, looking towards the right side of the frame, holding a glowing, ethereal flame or light source that illuminates the water and the surrounding area. The warm, golden glow of the light source reflects brightly on the water's surface, creating wavy streaks of orange and yellow. To the left, a large, dark tree trunk with sparse autumnal orange leaves dominates a portion of the foreground. On the right, distant trees are covered in vivid orange and red fall foliage, extending into the background. The sky is a deep, rich teal or turquoise, with hints of lighter teal and wispy, atmospheric clouds. Scattered orange leaves float on the dark, reflective surface of the water, which shows subtle ripples where the woman stands. The overall atmosphere is magical, tranquil, and slightly melancholic, with a strong contrast between the cool blues of the water and sky and the warm oranges of the foliage and light. The lighting is dramatic and evocative, highlighting the figure and the fiery glow against the cool backdrop. The art style mimics traditional painting with visible brushstrokes and a soft, dreamlike visual texture. Vertical orientation.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle weight shift causes gentle ripples to emanate. Hair strands and dress sway softly with the breeze. A flickering flame casts dancing light reflections. Autumn leaves drift with the current. The camera slowly zooms out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A woman stands in a swirling river, water violently churning as she suddenly transforms into a creature of pure flame. Her dress erupts in fire, tendrils lashing out. The flame she held explodes into a blinding inferno, causing the water to boil and vaporize. Autumn leaves are violently sucked into fiery tornadoes as trees spontaneously combust, shedding embers rather than leaves. The camera rapidly pulls back as the entire landscape erupts in a cataclysmic conflagration.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's dress sheds shimmering leaves that phase into water. As she steps, ripples reverse, pulling autumn leaves *up* from the water and attaching them to trees, which glow and solidify. The flame multiplies, forming a fiery river that flows *upwards* into the sky, pulling the entire scene toward a shimmering cosmic leaf.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, low and sweeping, glides over fallen autumn leaves on the shimmering water, revealing a woman in the river, her silhouette sharp against the fiery foliage. A dramatic lightning strike illuminates her face as she raises a flickering torch. The camera quickly zooms to her intense gaze, then slowly pulls back, showcasing the riverbanks alive with falling leaves, the flame's glow reflecting a haunting dance on the water's surface as a ripple slowly expands outwards.",
