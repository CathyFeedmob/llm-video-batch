    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:** A dynamic, full-body, watercolor-style illustration of a strong female rock climber, reminiscent of Lara Croft, actively ascending a jagged, grey rock face. The climber is depicted from a low-angle perspective, looking up towards her, emphasizing her muscular build and determined expression. She wears a grey tank top and dark shorts, with a utility belt featuring holsters/pouches. Her tanned skin contrasts with the cool tones of the rock. Her dark hair is pulled back in a ponytail. The rock texture is rough and weathered, with visible cracks and crevices, and a climbing rope is visible near her. The background features more imposing grey rock formations with a hint of bright, overcast sky in the distance. The lighting is diffused, highlighting contours without harsh shadows, creating a serious and adventurous atmosphere. The overall color palette is dominated by muted browns, greys, and blacks, with natural skin tones.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize for generation:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Strong female rock climber, Lara Croft-like (athletic build, determined expression, dark hair).\n*   **Action/Pose:** Actively climbing, hands gripping rock, body in upward motion, looking directly at viewer subtly.\n*   **Outfit/Gear:** Grey tank top, dark shorts, utility belt with holsters/pouches, climbing shoes, watch on wrist.\n*   **Environment:** Jagged, rough, grey rock face; hints of rope.\n*   **Composition:** Low-angle shot, full body, dramatic perspective.\n*   **Art Style:** Watercolor illustration, painterly textures, visible brushstrokes.\n*   **Color Palette:** Muted greys, browns, natural skin tones, minimal bright colors.\n*   **Lighting:** Diffused, natural, overcast feel, accentuating muscle definition.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Adventurous, determined, intense, serious.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera subtly moves down and in. Hair oscillates gently. Rope imperceptibly strains. Shoulders and back subtly contract and relax.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A sudden gust slams her hair, whipping it violently. The rope snaps taut, groaning under an unseen force. Her muscles ripple, bulging and contracting as a tremor rocks the immovable rock face. The cliff behind her fissures and crumbles, dust exploding outwards. A jagged peak rips through the sky, twisting and reforming.",

(Subtle yet intense focus pull): Her shoulders tense, a controlled breath escaping, as a shadow unexpectedly falls across her determined face.",
