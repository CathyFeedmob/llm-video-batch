  "video_prompt": "A high-angle aerial view slowly orbits a colossal ring-shaped structure. Sleek spacecraft continuously traverse the skies near and within it, one prominent ship flying horizontally. Thick atmospheric clouds and haze slowly drift, partially obscuring the structure and ground complexes. The desert planet subtly rotates. Countless internal lights glow with warm, flickering patterns, suggesting active habitation. Diffused sunlight subtly shifts, altering the mist's ethereal quality.",
  "image_prompt": "High-angle aerial view of a colossal futuristic ring city hovering over a desert planet, its curved horizon visible against the blackness of space. The massive ring megastructure features intricate grey and white angular buildings and spires, with countless windows glowing warm orange and yellow. Ethereal clouds and atmospheric haze partially enshroud its lower sections. Sleek futuristic spacecraft fly nearby. Below, a vast arid desert landscape stretches into the distance, dotted with other futuristic ground cities, also veiled by haze. Soft, diffused lighting enhances the immense sci-fi grandeur.",

Atmospheric elements slowly drift, periodically obscuring and revealing segments below. The distant planet subtly rotates. Internal lights glow and flicker with active patterns. Diffused sunlight subtly shifts across the scene, altering the mist's ethereal quality."
