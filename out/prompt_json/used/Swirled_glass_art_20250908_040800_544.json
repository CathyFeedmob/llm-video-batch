    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer and light refraction across the surface of the iridescent object as if interacting with soft, moving light sources. Gentle pulsing of the deep purple liquid within the spiral.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A mesmerizing, abstract, candy-like or glass dessert in a cylindrical, swirl shape, leaning slightly on its side on a clean white ceramic plate.\n\n**Composition:** Full shot, slightly elevated eye-level perspective, focused on the dessert. The object is positioned centrally but leaning towards the left, with its reflection clearly visible on the plate and casting a subtle shadow behind it. The plate occupies the lower third, and the background is a soft, bright, slightly desaturated white.\n\n**Visual Elements and Attributes:**\n*   **Dessert:** Approximately 2/3rds in width of the frame, lying diagonally. It has a smooth, glossy, translucent finish with distinct horizontal ridges or lines running along its cylindrical body, creating a subtle texture.\n*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant gradient of cool colors: starting with bright cyan/light blue on the left, transitioning through electric blue, then a rich lavender, and finally ending in a deep violet/purple on the right. The inner swirl, visible where the object is cut, shows a darker, almost metallic purple gel-like filling or core that swirls inward.\n*   **Lighting:** Bright, soft, diffused studio lighting from the top-left, creating brilliant specular highlights along the ridges of the object, emphasizing its glassy texture and translucency. There are also smaller, scattered pinprick highlights that resemble tiny sparkles or glitter. The lighting creates a distinct, soft shadow on the plate beneath the object, reflecting the object's vibrant colors with a gentle glow.\n\n**Style:** Modern, minimalist, art photography, dreamlike, high-end product photography.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Clean, ethereal, vibrant, magical, captivating.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n*   **Depth of Field:** Shallow, with the dessert in sharp focus and the background softly blurred to maintain focus on the subject.\n*   **Resolution:** High detail, sharp edges where intended, extremely high gloss.\n\n**Exclusions:** No text/logo, no human elements, no imperfections on the plate or dessert.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Shimmering iridescence, light refracting. Deep purple liquid, gently pulsing.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The iridescent object violently contorts, its shimmering surface erupting with fractured light as unseen forces tear it apart. The deep purple liquid within the spiral churns and lashes, violently escaping its confines, while the surrounding plate shatters outward in a blinding burst of energy, propelled by the object's chaotic transformation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "An iridescent spiral, defying gravity, slowly unfurls, shedding droplets of vibrant liquid that morph into tiny galaxies, each one pulsing with faint starlight before re-absorbing into the object. The air around the object oscillates, causing its surface to ripple like water, reflecting a spectral aurora that paints impossible shadows on the pure white plate.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly glides closer, revealing a shimmering, translucent object in close-up. Light refracts dramatically across its iridescent surface, creating an ethereal dance of blues and purples. A subtle pulsing begins within the deep purple liquid, creating a hypnotic effect. The camera circles the object, revealing new angles of its spiral form, as soft light sources gently shift, amplifying the play of light and shadow, creating a mystifying aura.",
