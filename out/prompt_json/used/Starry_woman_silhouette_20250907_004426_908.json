    "video_prompt": "A gentle wind causes the woman's hair and dress to subtly sway. Stars and golden particles softly shimmer and drift like falling dust. The background clouds subtly shift and undulate. The golden elements in the background slowly drip downwards.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA surreal and dreamlike painting featuring the silhouette of a woman walking forward, painted from the neck down. Her body embodies a starry, cosmic night sky, transitioning from deep blue and purple at the bottom to a lighter blue and warm pastel pink at the top. Golden flowers with intricate petals and leaves bloom vigorously across the lower half of her dress, appearing to grow directly from the cosmic fabric. Her silhouette is sharply defined against a hazy background of blue and white clouds, some with pinkish-orange hues from a distant light source, possibly a sunset or sunrise. Golden specks and small, glowing stars are scattered throughout the background and within the woman's cosmic form, some appearing as glistening drops or vertical streaks of gold. The overall atmosphere is ethereal, magical, and serene. The style is painterly with visible brushstrokes, combining elements of fantasy, cosmic art, and botanical illustration. There's a subtle dripping effect with black and gold paint at the very bottom of the image, suggesting the dissolution into a darker ethereal space. A subtle golden signature \"c29\" is in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Simplified for concise use:**\n\nSurreal painting of a woman's silhouette, her body a starry deep blue-purple cosmic sky. Golden blooming flowers on her lower half. Background of hazy blue/white clouds with pink/orange light. Scattered golden specks and stars throughout, some dripping vertically. Ethereal, magical, serene atmosphere. Painterly style, fantasy, cosmic, botanical. Subtle black/gold paint drip effect at bottom. Golden \"c29\" signature.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Wind rustles the woman's hair and dress. Shimmering stars and golden particles drift and descend. Clouds subtly undulate. Golden background elements slowly drip.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Woman's hair whips violently, dress billows manically. Stars explode, golden particles erupt like a furious storm. Background clouds twist and churn into monstrous shapes. Golden elements surge upwards, then crash down like molten lava. The woman's outline pulses with raw energy, leaving streaks of light in its wake.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's silhouette shatters into shimmering stardust, each speck a tiny nebula. Her dress, adorned with golden peonies, blooms in reverse, petals folding inwards as if rewinding. Golden particles spiral upwards, forming tiny constellations that then liquefy into trails of light, falling into the sky like a reverse rain. Clouds morph into cosmic serpents, devouring light then expelling glittering stardust that coalesces back into the woman's form. Gravity reverses, then loops, causing the entire scene to invert and then right itself, all in slow, dreamlike undulations.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow zoom in reveals the woman's hair and dress subtly swaying as golden particles gracefully drift. The camera dramatically pans down her dress, following the golden flowers that appear to bloom and glow. Clouds in the background undulate, while ethereal golden drips slowly fall, emphasizing the mystical beauty. The scene culminates with a gentle drift to the signature, as stars subtly shimmer.",
