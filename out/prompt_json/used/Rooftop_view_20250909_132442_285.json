    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA lone male figure, viewed from behind, stands on the edge of a high-rise rooftop, looking out over a sprawling futuristic cityscape. He wears a tattered, distressed, earth-toned jacket (like an old military or work jacket) with visible wear, rents, and possibly faded or worn patches, and dark pants tucked into sturdy boots. His hair is short and dark, slightly disheveled. The rooftop itself is metallic, rusty, and grimy, with exposed rebar or wiring and a simple metal railing on one side.\n\n**Composition:**\nHigh-angle, wide shot showcasing the vast urban landscape. The figure is centered in the lower half of the frame, providing a sense of scale and vulnerability against the immense city. The central towering skyscraper, topped with antennas, visually intersects with the setting sun. Numerous other skyscrapers of varying heights fill the midground, receding into the hazy distance. The lines of the buildings and the city's grid naturally draw the eye towards the horizon and the main focal points.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant warm palette of oranges, deep reds, and dusky purples in the sky, particularly around the setting sun. The city below shifts from muted dark blues and deep greys in the foreground to increasingly hazy, desaturated tones in the background, blending with the sky's warmth. Scattered, soft yellow and white lights are visible from windows and streets within the city, creating small pinpricks of light against the darkness. The man's jacket has muted greens and earthy browns, contrasting with the sky.\n\n**Lighting:**\nDramatic, low sunlight from a setting or rising sun, creating a strong silhouette effect on the central skyscraper and the distant buildings. The sky is ablaze with light directly behind the main tower. The city below is predominantly in shadow, illuminated only by internal building lights and diffuse ambient light from the sky. The man’s back is softly illuminated by the indirect light, highlighting the textures of his jacket. Subtle bloom or glow around the sun and some city lights.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nEpic, melancholic, and slightly post-apocalyptic or cyberpunk. A feeling of isolation and contemplation. The vastness of the city suggests a dense, complex world. The worn appearance of the man and the grimy rooftop adds a sense of hardship and realism. The orange sky evokes both beauty and a hint of an ominous or polluted environment. A sense of \"end of an era\" or quiet observation.\n\n**Style:**\nRealistic with a cinematic, slightly gritty, and atmospheric aesthetic. Detailed textures on the man's clothing and the rooftop. High level of detail in the cityscape, but with atmospheric perspective blurring distant elements. Rendered with depth of field, focusing on the foreground figure and the central skyscraper while blurring closer foreground elements on the roof.\n\n**Artistic References (Optional, but can help guide the AI):**\nInspired by dystopian sci-fi themes, monumental cityscapes in films like Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell, and the contemplative mood of works like \"Nighthawks\" but on a grand scale.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle smoke billows from the cityscape. Lights subtly twinkle across buildings. The man's tattered jacket sways. The orange sunset light subtly pulses. The camera subtly zooms out and pans down.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings *violently* shudder and crack, their lights *exploding* into blinding flares. The man's tattered jacket *rips apart* with explosive force, fragments violently scattering into the churning, crimson sky. The sun *pulsates erratically*, throwing agitated, scorching light across the *writhing* cityscape. The camera *plunges downward* at dizzying speed, abruptly *spinning* to reveal a chasm rupturing below, disgorging turbulent smoke and molten light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The city perpetually inhales, buildings subtly contracting, then exhales, the skyline expanding. The sun, a molten tear, drips upwards, reforming. The man’s tattered jacket unravels into spectral whispers, then reweaves, now composed of shimmering twilight and fleeting memories. Distant lights ignite and extinguish like fireflies caught in a temporal eddy, their glow stretching into impossible colors across the sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The scene opens with a wide shot of a man in a tattered jacket, subtly swaying in the faint breeze, silhouetted against a vibrant orange sunset over a sprawling cityscape. As subtle smoke rises from distant buildings and city lights begin to twinkle, the camera begins a slow, deliberate zoom-out, gradually revealing the dizzying height from which the man gazes. The orange sunset light subtly pulsates, casting long, dramatic shadows. The camera then makes a slow, dramatic pan downwards, emphasizing the city's vastness and the man's precarious position on the edge of the building.",
