    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze rustles the troll's red mohawk and the fur details on his clothing. Sparse, dry grass sways subtly in the foreground. Shadows from distant clouds drift slowly across the landscape. The troll's chest subtly rises and falls with a slow breath.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the given image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA muscular, blue-skinned troll with a prominent red mohawk stands in a vibrant, sun-drenched grassy field. His face is fierce with bared fangs and golden hoop earrings. He is clad in rustic, tribal-style brown leather and fur armor, adorned with bone-like pendants and a large skull emblem on his belt. A quiver of long, spiky spears with red cloth accents is strapped to his back. He firmly grasps a formidable spear with a broad metal tip in his left hand, pointing slightly downward.\n\nThe composition is a dynamic wide shot, looking up at the troll from a slightly low angle, emphasizing his imposing stature. The light source is a bright, clear sky, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the textures of his skin and armor. The background features rolling green hills receding into the distance, with hints of a winding river and distant mountains under a blue sky with soft, diffuse clouds. The overall atmosphere is adventurous and powerful, rendered in a detailed, painterly comic book art style with rich, saturated colors and crisp details. A faint \"c29\" signature is present in the lower right corner, appearing as if painted into the image.\n\n**Key elements broken down:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Muscular blue-skinned troll, red mohawk, fierce expression, bared fangs, golden hoop earrings.\n*   **Attire/Gear:** Rustic tribal brown leather and fur armor, bone pendants, skull belt emblem, quiver of long spiky spears with red cloth accents, spear with broad metal tip.\n*   **Pose/Action:** Standing dynamically, left hand firmly grasping spear pointing slightly downward.\n*   **Environment:** Vibrant, sun-drenched grassy field, rolling green hills, distant river and mountains.\n*   **Composition:** Dynamic wide shot, slightly low angle looking up at the troll.\n*   **Lighting:** Bright, clear sky as light source, subtle shadows, highlights.\n*   **Colors:** Rich, saturated greens, blues, reds, browns, and earthy tones.\n*   **Style:** Detailed, painterly comic book art style.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Adventurous, powerful.\n*   **Additional Details:** Faint \"c29\" signature in lower right.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The troll's red mohawk and fur details gently sway. Sparse, dry grass in the foreground subtly sways. Shadows drift across the landscape. The troll's chest slowly rises and falls.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The troll's red mohawk erupts into a fiery vortex, whipping violently. His fur clothing segments tear and regenerate like living armor, jagged edges pulsating. The dry grass explodes upward in sharp, thorny tendrils, impaling the sky. Distant cloud shadows contort into swirling, predatory beasts, lunging across the landscape. The troll’s chest heaves, muscles coiling, as his breath manifests as a deafening roar, shattering the air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The troll's mohawk transforms into spectral flames, dancing erratically, while his fur detaches and coalesces into miniature, impossibly rotating planets. The grass blades stretch into luminous, undulating ribbons, defying gravity. Clouds unravel into shimmering liquid light, painting the landscape with transient, geometric patterns. His breath exhales a prism of colors that rewind into his mouth, distorting his face into a shifting nebula.",

(CRANE SHOT) The camera lifts, showcasing the vast, undulating landscape. (PAN RIGHT, LOW ANGLE) His powerful hand grips a spear, knuckles white, as his gaze scans the horizon. (OVERHEAD SHOT) A lone cloud passes, casting a brief shadow that dances across the dry, swaying grass.",
