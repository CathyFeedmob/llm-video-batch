  "video_prompt": "Celestial elements and beetles shimmer, subtly shifting their metallic sheen. Stars pulse with light, their patterns subtly transforming. Intricate golden lines subtly undulate, reshaping the internal divisions. Backgrounds gently swirl and transition, altering in color intensity.",
  "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, stylized, portrait-oriented artwork with intricate gold metallic framing dividing celestial and organic elements. Features prominent ornate silver stars and golden/silver beetles against cosmic backgrounds (dark blue, teal-blue, grey gradients with star fields and swirling patterns). A large central oval frame dominates, radiating light from a detailed star. Smaller framed beetles and stars are systematically placed. The overall aesthetic is luxurious, fantastical, and reminiscent of ancient religious art or steampunk cosmology with a blend of natural forms and celestial motifs.",
