    "video_prompt": "Subtle cloud movement and haze in the sky. Aircraft engine glows flicker and emit subtle exhaust trails. Distant background lights gently pulse.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, highly-detailed vertical shot of a futuristic cityscape composed of towering, intricately designed structures resembling steampunk-inspired skyscrapers, piercing through a soft, cloudy sky. Numerous small, sleek spacecraft, reminiscent of retro-futuristic jets with glowing blue thrusters, navigate the bustling airspace between the buildings. Some structures are connected by high-level bridges teeming with tiny, silhouetted human figures, suggesting lively pedestrian activity. The composition emphasizes depth, with multiple layers of buildings and flying vehicles. The lighting is bright and ethereal, casting a warm glow on the metal surfaces of the buildings and ships. The atmosphere is one of advanced civilization and active aerial movement, creating a sense of wonder and a futuristic utopia. The color palette primarily features metallic grays and bronze, accented by the luminous blues of the spacecraft engines and building lights, against a backdrop of soft blues and whites from the sky and clouds. The overall style is reminiscent of hyperrealistic digital painting, with a clear focus on intricate mechanical details and dynamic cloud formations. There's a subtle watermark of \"29\" in the bottom right corner, suggesting a brand or artist signature.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle cloud drift and atmospheric haze shift. Aircraft engine luminescence subtly flickers, with faint exhaust trails emerging. Distant background lights gently undulate.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings violently sway and buckle. Cloud formations churn aggressively, revealing glimpses of stormy skies. Jets dart erratically, engines flaring intensely, leaving turbulent, glowing contrails. Distant lights flash erratically, then burst. Bridges vibrate, people tumble. Explosions ripple, scattering debris. Supernatural forces are hinted at through impossible, rapid transformations of structures. The entire scene pulsates with chaotic, unstable energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Shattered light particles reassemble into floating, iridescent skyscrapers that slowly spiral inwards, dissolving into ethereal mist. Anti-gravity jets pull ships backward through time, their exhaust trails reabsorbing into glowing engines. Clouds ripple like liquid, revealing impossible, kaleidoscopic city reflections. Pedestrians on impossible bridges float upwards, their forms subtly shifting into star constellations.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sleek spacecraft banks sharply, its engines flaring dramatically as it weaves through giant, cloud-piercing towers.  The camera spirals, following its ascent, revealing a vast cityscape bathed in a golden, hazy light. Distant aircraft leave shimmering trails, their engines briefly intensifying creating a captivating glow. The camera then performs a sweeping motion across the vast, futuristic cityscape, revealing distant cloud formations with atmospheric light filtering through them.",
