    "video_prompt": "The fox's ears twitch slightly, responding to a subtle, unheard sound. Fine fur on the chest and shoulders gently shimmers, mimicking a soft breeze. The colorful ribbons hanging from the umbrella and waist flutter delicately. The tassels on the umbrella and the fox's belt sway in rhythm with an imperceptible movement. The small bells attached to the beads and the fox's attire jingle softly, almost inaudibly. The fox's eyes narrow slightly, then relax, indicating a blink. A very subtle camera pan from bottom to top, revealing more of the fox's tail and the full length of the umbrella.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot, captivating anthropomorphic fox character, masculine, adorned in traditional East Asian-inspired attire. The fox has rich red-orange fur, prominent pointed ears, and intense golden-yellow eyes with slitted pupils, gazing slightly to the right with a subtle, knowing expression. He is holding a weathered, beige oil-paper parasol with ornate tassels and colorful ribbons flowing from its frame, providing shade from a bright, overhead light source.\n\nThe character's outfit includes a white inner tunic, a dark outer robe, and a loose-fitting teal shirt tied with a wide, rust-red sash. He wears multiple layered bracelets and rings on his wrists and fingers, incorporating a variety of colorful beads, turquoise-like accents, and metallic elements. Around his neck are several strands of large, earthy-toned beads. Attached to his waist are symbolic elements: a pair of white garlic bulbs, a brass bell with intricate designs on a textured pouch, and another smaller satchel. Colorful, thin ribbons (red, orange, green, blue, purple) trail from his left side, giving a sense of dynamic movement.\n\nThe art style is a richly painted digital illustration, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly textured feel reminiscent of traditional painting. The lighting is bright and atmospheric, casting soft shadows and highlighting the character's fur and accessories. The background consists of hazy, light-toned traditional East Asian architecture (pagoda-like structures) under a bright, overcast sky, suggesting an outdoor setting in natural light. The overall mood is mystical and serene, with a hint of quiet strength. The composition is a portrait orientation, focusing tightly on the character from chest to mid-thigh, with the parasol extending above his head. The color palette is warm and earthy, dominated by oranges, reds, browns, and muted greens, with pops of vibrant color from the ribbons and beads.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize for AI generation:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Anthropomorphic fox, masculine.\n*   **Pose:** Standing, holding parasol, subtle head turn right.\n*   **Attire Details:** East Asian traditional, white tunic, dark robe, teal shirt, red sash, layered bracelets/rings, beaded necklaces, waist accessories (garlic, bells, satchel).\n*   **Accessories:** Weathered oil-paper parasol with tassels and colorful ribbons.\n*   **Colors:** Red-orange fur, golden-yellow eyes, earthy tones, vibrant accent colors on ribbons/beads.\n*   **Lighting:** Bright, soft, atmospheric, overhead light source.\n*   **Background:** Hazy East Asian architecture, light sky.\n*   **Art Style:** Painted digital illustration, visible brushstrokes, textured.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Mystical, serene, quiet strength.\n*   **Composition:** Portrait crop, chest to mid-thigh, parasol extends high.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The fox's ears violently flick, the umbrella shatters into flying splinters, ribbons whip into a swirling vortex.

    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fox's ears unfurl into spectral wings, lifting it gracefully off the ground. Its fur dissolves into constellations, stars twinkling and swirling across its body.
