  "video_prompt": "A heavily armored soldier crouches low, aiming a futuristic weapon whose tip glows, ready to fire, as sand shifts around them. A convoy of rugged armored vehicles speeds across a sandy canyon, kicking up thick plumes of dust. Above, aerial combat vehicles actively engage, firing streaking orange projectiles while their blue-white thrusters propel them forward or hold them aloft. A colossal metallic spaceship soars directly overhead. The distant desert canyon landscape gradually blurs into a hazy horizon.",
  "image_prompt": "A dynamic, action-packed futuristic military engagement in a vast, arid desert canyon under harsh daylight. Over-the-shoulder, a kneeling armored soldier with glowing red eyes aims a glowing dual-barreled weapon on disturbed sand. A convoy of tan, rugged armored vehicles kicks up dust on the canyon floor, while aerial gunships fire fiery orange projectiles with streaking trails, their thrusters glowing blue-white. A colossal metallic spaceship with intricate underside and multiple engines soars directly overhead. Towering reddish-brown rock formations and mesas frame the background against a pale blue sky. Earthy palette of ochre, sienna, tan, vibrant with fiery weapon effects and cool blue thruster glows. Deep perspective.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Sand visibly shifts around a heavily armored soldier who subtly adjusts their aim, their futuristic weapon's tip intensifying its glow, readying for discharge. A convoy of rugged armored vehicles actively speeds across a sandy canyon, dynamically kicking up thick plumes of dust. Above, aerial combat vehicles maneuver through active engagement, firing streaking orange projectiles while their blue-white thrusters dynamically propel them or hold them aloft. A colossal metallic spaceship soars steadily overhead. The distant desert canyon landscape gradually blurs into a hazy horizon."
