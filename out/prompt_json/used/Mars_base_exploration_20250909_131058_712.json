    "video_prompt": "Subtle glinting stars in the distant space. The large planet in the sky shows very slow, subtle atmospheric movement. The large space station subtly pulses with light from its primary thruster. The rovers on the ground kick up tiny puffs of dust as they move forward. The shadows of the rovers subtly lengthen as if the sun is slowly setting. Minimal lens flare from the large glowing orb behind the space station contributes to a sense of depth and movement.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down into key elements to facilitate recreation:\n\n**Detailed Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nA bold, illustrative science fiction scene with a comic book aesthetic, depicted in a vertical orientation.\n\n**Visual Elements & Composition:**\n\n*   **Foreground & Midground:** A multi-wheeled, white and light blue science rover, similar to a lunar or Martian rover, occupies the lower right, angled slightly left, receding diagonally into the midground. Its large, rugged tires throw a dark, jagged shadow. A second, smaller, similar rover is visible in the midground, further down the sandy, rocky path. The foreground terrain is rough, with scattered orange-brown rocks and subtle tire tracks.\n*   **Background - Terrestrial:** A vast, alien desert landscape with undulating hills and valleys in shades of ochre, rust, and brown, stretching towards a distant horizon. A futuristic base or city is nestled at the base of some hills, featuring multiple tall, slender rocket-like structures and industrial buildings. A wide, sweeping riverbed or canyon is visible across the middle ground.\n*   **Background - Celestial:** A prominent, gas giant planet with ethereal, swirling turquoise and deep blue rings dominates the upper left sky, partially obscured by the foreground landscape. The dark expanse of space above is peppered with small, bright stars.\n*   **Celestial Objects & Vehicles:** Multiple spacecraft are visible in orbit. A large, complex space station or mothership with prominent thrusters and extending solar arrays or structures hangs in the upper center, emitting a bright, conical beam of light downwards. Other smaller, sleeker spacecraft are seen: one thin and rocket-like ascending from the left, and another, more angular craft flying horizontally from the right, leaving a long, bright blue energy trail. A smaller, boxier ship is further to the right, also with a blue energy trail.\n\n**Style:**\n\n*   **Comic Book/Graphic Novel:** Features crisp, defining black outlines around all elements. Distinct areas of flat or subtly textured color.\n*   **Illustrative:** Hand-drawn aesthetic, not photorealistic. Attention to detail in mechanical components and geological features.\n*   **Hard Sci-Fi:** Realistic yet futuristic design for vehicles and structures.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   **Dominant Hues:** Warm browns, oranges, and ochres for the planet's surface; cool blues and turquoises for the space environment and planetary rings.\n*   **Accents:** White and light blue for the rovers, bright blue for energy trails and space station lights, hints of yellow/gold on the rover's panels. Dark black for shadows and outlines.\n*   **Contrast:** Strong contrast between the warm planet surface and cool space elements.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n*   **Directional:** Light appears to originate from the celestial bodies (planet, stars) and artificial sources (space station beam, ship trails).\n*   **Hard Shadows:** Sharp, defined shadows on the ground cast by the rovers, indicating a strong light source.\n*   **Glow:** Luminescent blue coming from the space station beam and ship trails, creating a sense of energy and movement.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Expansive & Grand:** Conveys the vastness of space and an alien world.\n*   **Exploration & Discovery:** A sense of ongoing scientific endeavor and human presence in a distant future.\n*   **Futuristic & Advanced:** Technologies like advanced rovers, space stations, and highly developed spacecraft.\n*   **Serene yet Active:** Despite the grand scale, there's a calm and purposeful activity implied by the rovers and ships.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Prompt:**\n\nDistant stars subtly glint. A large planet's atmosphere slowly undulates. A space station's thruster subtly pulses with light. Rovers kick up tiny dust puffs as their shadows gradually lengthen. Minimal lens flare subtly shifts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Stars explode across the cosmos! The colossal planet's atmosphere violently churns, revealing chaotic storms. The space station thrashes, its thrusters blasting erratic, explosive bursts of light. Rovers rip across the ground, sending geysers of dust skyward, their shadows wildly contorting and racing. Intense lens flares erupt from the pulsating orb, disorienting the viewer in a chaotic, unpredictable dance of light!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity inversely pulls the rovers as they effortlessly glide backward, trailing nebulae that subtly transmute into shimmering stardust. The space station’s thrusters emit a silent symphony of light that subtly warps the distant planet into a kaleidoscopic vortex, its rings rippling like watercolors. Shadows morph into ethereal ribbons, tethering the rovers to an ever-swirling celestial ballet.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Opening with a panoramic sweep of the Mars-like landscape, two rovers trek across the desolate terrain, kicking up plumes of red dust. The camera then dramatically zooms skyward, revealing the colossal planet in the sky whose rings subtly swirl. A powerful shot introduces a towering space station, its thrusters firing dramatically, illuminating the vast emptiness. As the camera pulls back, the rovers' shadows lengthen ominously, hinting at an unknown approaching.",
