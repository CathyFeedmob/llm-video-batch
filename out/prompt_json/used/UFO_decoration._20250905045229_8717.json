  "video_prompt": "Flying saucer descends, luminous strands unfurling. Passengers in glowing spheres float downward, swaying gently. Pedestrians move through illuminated streets, gazing upwards. Ornate street lamps flicker. Sky transitions from dusk to dawn hues organically.",
  "image_prompt": "A fantastical urban scene at dusk/dawn. A large, metallic, disc-shaped object resembling a classic flying saucer hovers above a historical European-style cobblestone street lined with tall, narrow buildings. The disc is adorned with glowing lights and has golden, luminous strands cascading from its underside, creating a giant chandelier effect. Interspersed among the strands are large, red, glowing spherical ornaments with silhouetted people inside. Ornate street lamps illuminate the street below, where numerous pedestrians walk. The sky exhibits subtle gradients of orange and pink, creating a magical, dreamlike atmosphere.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A flying saucer steadily descends, luminous strands unfurling and lengthening below it. Passengers encased in glowing spheres drift downward, gently swaying. Pedestrians throng the streets, their heads tilting skyward, expressions shifting from awe to wonder as they walk. Ornate street lamps intermittently flicker. The sky fluidly shifts from deep dusk purples to soft dawn pinks."
