    "video_prompt": "The woman breathing, her hair gently swaying in the desert breeze, and the metallic elements of her exoskeleton exhibiting a subtle, soft glow. The camera subtly zooms in.",
    "image_prompt": "full-body shot of an Asian woman as a futuristic desert wanderer, with cybernetic enhancements and a mechanical exoskeleton. She has short, dark hair blowing slightly in the wind, a serene expression, and is looking slightly towards the right. She wears brown utility pants and a form-fitting brown corset/bodice over a high-collared dark top, with parts of her body covered, and augmented by sleek, metallic, light-grey robotic armor covering her chest, arms, and legs. Exposed wires, glowing elements (orange and blue), and intricate mechanical details are visible on the exoskeleton and backpack-like apparatus. The background is a vast, sandy desert landscape with sparse scrub brush under a clear, bright blue sky. The lighting is harsh and bright, indicative of a desert environment, creating strong highlights and subtle shadows. The overall style is a blend of cyberpunk and sci-fi aesthetic, with a focus on detailed machinery and human integration. The composition shows her in a dynamic, walking pose, viewed from a slightly low angle.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle chest rise and fall. Hair ripples softly. Exoskeleton gleams and dims intermittently. Gentle camera push-in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her metal limbs *snap* into action, whirring fiercely as the desert sands erupt around her, swept by an unseen force. Hair *whips* wildly, defying the gale, as her exoskeleton *blazes* with volatile energy, veins of light pulsing erratically, hinting at an imminent, explosive transformation. The ground itself *fractures* under her powerful stride, dust clouds *billowing* violently.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's metallic exoskeleton glows, not with light, but with sound, shimmering like liquid air. Her hair, defying gravity, streams upward, forming intricate, impossible braids of desert sand. In reverse, the wind pulls the sand from the ground. The desert floor ripples, turning into mirrored water, reflecting impossible constellations. Her footsteps pull the stars down around her.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Opening with a slow, sweeping crane shot over the shifting desert Sands, the camera then dramatically tracks forward, pushing past rippling heat haze to find the woman. Her hair (1) whips wildly in a sudden gust, kicking up dust as the camera (2) rapidly zooms into her face, (3) then immediately pulls back on a fluid, circular arc to reveal the glowing, intricate details of her metallic exoskeleton, (4) before focusing on an intense, lingering close-up of her determined gaze.",
