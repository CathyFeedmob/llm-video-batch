  "video_prompt": "A vibrant natural scene where various organic elements, including orange peels, berries, white flowers, bark, green leaves, and orange slices, gently ascend and drift across a clear blue sky. Light pink petals softly disperse, while fine white specks subtly animate the air. A hazy, mossy ground blurs below, crisscrossed by thin tendrils.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a vibrant, ethereal digital composite image featuring natural elements floating and rising against a clear blue sky. Include:\n\n*   An long, slender, textured, orange peel-like object floating upwards.\n*   A single, smooth pink berry.\n*   Scattered white jasmine-like flowers and light pink petals, some on green leafy branches.\n*   Two curved pieces of bark/wood (one arching, one broken).\n*   Green leaves, including a prominent branch with light green leaves and clusters of bright pink berries.\n*   Translucent, glowing slices of dried orange (upper and lower right).\n*   A hazy, blurred grassy/mossy foreground with thin, winding brown tendrils.\n*   Tiny white specks (pollen/dust) in the sky.\n*   Bright, sunny lighting with soft shadows.\n*   Predominantly natural greens, oranges, and pinks.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Orange peels, berries, white flowers, bark, green leaves, and orange slices continually ascend and drift across the frame. Pink petals softly disperse and fall. Fine white specks subtly animate the air, swirling gently. The background undergoes dynamic focus shifts, blurring and unblurring, while thin ground tendrils subtly sway."
