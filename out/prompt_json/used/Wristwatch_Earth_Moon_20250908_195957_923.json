    "video_prompt": "Subtle dust motes slowly drift across the moon's surface, reflecting the faint light. The planet Earth in the background very subtly rotates, revealing different landmasses. Minute glints of light shift across the watch case and crystal, as if from a passing, distant light source or very slight camera movement. The shadow cast by the watch subtly deepens or lightens.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVertical shot of a black chronograph watch with gold accents and a black leather strap, lying on a desolate, rocky moon-like surface. The watch is positioned centrally, slightly angled, showcasing its face and a portion of the strap. In the background, the Earth is partially visible, appearing large and curved against a dark, starless space. The Earth's continents and oceans are discernible with a soft blue and brown coloration, with some atmospheric haze.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Watch:** Black casing, black face with gold indices and hands, three sub-dials. Black leather strap. The brand name \"ARTHURIAN\" is clearly visible on the watch face.\n*   **Foreground (Moon Surface):** Irregularly shaped, rough grey rocks and finer moon dust/gravel. Shadows are cast by the rocks and the watch, indicating a single light source.\n*   **Background (Earth & Space):** Blue and brown globe of Earth, showing landmasses and oceans. Deep dark blue/black space.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, photographic, slightly cinematic due to the dramatic setting.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Rule of thirds applied to the watch's placement.\n*   Natural framing by the foreground rocks.\n*   Strong depth of field with the watch in sharp focus and the Earth softly blurred.\n\n**Colors:** Muted and cool tones dominate:\n*   **Watch:** Sleek black and metallic gold.\n*   **Moon Surface:** Shades of grey, dark grey, and light grey.\n*   **Earth:** Blues (oceans) and browns/greens (landmasses).\n*   **Space:** Deep, dark blue/black.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Dramatic and directional, coming from the upper right or slightly above, casting distinct shadows.\n*   Creates highlights on the metallic elements of the watch and the texture of the rocks.\n*   Subtle glow on the Earth, suggesting a light source also illuminating it from the front/side.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Majestic, awe-inspiring, adventurous, and serene. Emphasizes the vastness of space and the solitary nature of the moon surface.\n\n**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (vertical).",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The watch violently shakes, then levitates and spins wildly. Craters explode outwards, launching debris towards the rapidly approaching Earth. The moonâ€™s surface erupts with volcanic activity, spewing molten rock as the planet accelerates its rotation, continents blurring into a chaotic swirl of color. Streaks of light flash across the watch as if struck by an unseen, powerful force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The moon rocks ripple and transform into liquid clock parts, flowing around the earth which glows from within, reversing its rotation. Watch hands, untethered, dance erratically, becoming cosmic serpents that devour the moon's surface, birthing nebulae of golden light. Shadows stretch and recoil, forming vortexes that pull the watch into a kaleidoscopic dimension, only to re-emerge as a shimmering constellation in the night sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, wide push-in reveals a luxury watch nestled amongst lunar rocks, Earth majestically rotating in the background. A deep shadow dramatically crawls across the watch face, then recedes as if touched by a passing cosmic light from above, highlighting its intricate details. Subtle dust motes glint momentarily, catching the shifting, ethereal light as the camera gently arcs around the watch, revealing more of the vast lunar landscape.",
