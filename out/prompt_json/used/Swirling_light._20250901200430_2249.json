    "video_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from more concise to slightly more detailed, depending on the model's preference:\n\n**Option 1 (Most Concise):**\n\n> A lone figure, seen from behind, walks purposefully down a reflective pathway flanked by towering, ancient-futuristic monoliths. She journeys towards a massive, swirling orange cosmic vortex in a star-speckled dark blue sky, which emits glowing energy streaks. The scene is illuminated by striking electric blue light on the path and structures, contrasted with intense orange glows and embers. An epic, mysterious journey in a fantastical world of ancient stone and powerful magical energy.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Detail):**\n\n> A lone female figure, with long dark hair, walks away from the viewer on a dark, reflective pathway. She moves towards an immense, fiery orange cosmic vortex dominating a star-filled deep blue sky, from which glowing orange energy streaks descend. The path is flanked by massive, dark, rough-hewn pillars, glowing with electric blue lines and eerie orange organic elements. The ground also features pools of electric blue light and scattered orange embers. The atmosphere is one of awe and epic destiny, blending ancient architecture with futuristic or magical energy, primarily using vibrant orange and electric blue.\n\n**Option 3 (Focusing on Dynamics for Video):**\n\n> **Scene:** A lone female figure journeys through an otherworldly cityscape at twilight.\n> **Action:** She walks purposefully, seen from behind, down a long, reflective pathway. Her long dark hair gently sways.\n> **Environment:** Towering, dark, ancient-looking monoliths, glowing with electric blue lines and embedded orange organic elements, flank the path, receding into a misty distance.\n> **Background:** A colossal, intensely bright, swirling orange cosmic vortex dominates the dark blue, star-studded sky, emitting glowing orange energy streaks that descend like rain.\n> **Lighting/Color:** Vibrant orange light from the vortex and scattered embers dramatically contrasts with electric blue pools of light on the path and pillars. The pathway shimmers with reflections.\n> **Mood:** Epic, mysterious, awe-inspiring, a blend of ancient architecture and powerful magical/cosmic energy.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n\"A lone female figure, viewed from behind, walks on a dark, reflective path towards a magnificent cosmic phenomenon. The path is illuminated by streams of electric blue light and scattered glowing orange embers. Massive, dark, rough-hewn stone pillars flank the path, adorned with glowing electric blue vertical lines and embedded, organic, orange-glowing pods. Ahead, an enormous, intensely bright, fiery orange cosmic vortex dominates the deep blue-purple, star-dotted sky, with streaks of orange light descending like ethereal rain. The figure has long, dark hair and light-colored clothing, gazing upward at the spectacle. The dominant palette of vibrant orange and electric blue creates a dramatic, otherworldly contrast. Strong leading lines, vertical composition. Epic, awe-inspiring, mysterious journey.\""
