    "video_prompt": "A slow, ominous camera push-in on the creature, causing subtle movements in the mist swirling around it. The blue light details on the creature subtly flicker and pulse. Lights within the city windows slightly twinkle. The foreground crowd of people exhibit extremely subtle shifts, perhaps a slight lean or a head turn, and their silhouettes shimmer faintly.",
    "image_prompt": "A stunning, highly detailed, dramatic, and dark sci-fi painting of a huge mechanical monster with glowing blue eyes and accents hovering over a city at night. The monster is massive, filling much of the upper frame, its body a complex weave of dark metal with intricate mechanical details and parts, emitting light blue glows from various sections. It has large, ominous horns or spikes extending from its head and back, reaching towards the top of the frame. Wisps of smoke or clouds surround its form, suggesting its immense size and power.\n\nThe monster dominates the skyline, with tall, dark skyscrapers flanking it on either side, their windows glowing with warm yellow and orange lights, creating a sharp contrast against the dark sky and the monster's cool blue lights. The urban environment below is bustling with human activity, illuminated by the city lights. Crowds of people are visible on the streets, looking up in awe and perhaps fear at the colossal entity. Their silhouettes are dark against the lit street, adding to the dramatic tension. The street itself is damp, reflecting the city lights.\n\nThe perspective is from street level, looking up at the towering monster and buildings, emphasizing its scale. The overall atmosphere is dark, ominous, and epic. The color palette is dominated by dark blues, grays, and black, with accents of glowing blues and reds from the monster and warm oranges/yellows from the city lights. The lighting is low-key, with dramatic contrasts between light and shadow, highlighting the monster and the illuminated city below. The style is hyper-realistic with a painterly touch, reminiscent of concept art for a blockbuster sci-fi film.\n\n**(No text, no watermarks, no logos)**",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The camera slowly pushes forward, causing the surrounding mist to subtly swirl and dissipate. The creature's blue light details subtly flicker and pulse. City window lights softly twinkle. The foreground crowd exhibits imperceptible shifts: subtle leans, head turns, and shimmering silhouettes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A colossal, mechanical beast violently rips through the city skyline, debris exploding outward. Buildings violently sway and collapse, lights shattering. The creature's blue energy flares erratically, emitting blinding pulses that illuminate the panicked, scattering crowd. Distant skyscrapers shatter from sonic blasts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The monstrous mech subtly phases through the buildings, its blue lights bleeding into the city's windows, making them briefly glow and then completely vanish. The people in the street below ripple and distort, transforming into ethereal smoke that drifts upwards, then reforms into glass shards that rain down. The mist around the creature pulses like a heart, compressing and expanding, mirroring the impossible ebb and flow of a phantom ocean in the sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow pan from the bewildered crowd, tracking upwards as the colossal creature descends, shrouded in an ethereal mist. Blue lights on its metallic form pulsate and intensify, reflecting off the building windows. A gust of wind sweeps through the street, causing a ripple effect in the crowd. The creature's head subtly shifts, its glowing eyes scanning the city.",
