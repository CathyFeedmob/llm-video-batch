    "video_prompt": "Glittering particles subtly drift from the butterfly's wings and body, slowly cascading downwards and across the frame like cosmic dust, with a gentle, almost imperceptible pulsation of light from within the butterfly itself. A faint, soft rainbow shimmers and subtly shifts its colors in the bottom left, accompanied by an ultra-slow, gentle zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "A digital artwork of a vivid butterfly in dynamic flight, bursting with sparkling particles. The butterfly's wings are predominantly red and orange, with subtle blue and purple undertones, and are composed of countless small, glowing dots, resembling glitter or stardust. These particles extend outwards from the butterfly, creating a trailing effect against the deep indigo background. The left wing is prominently displayed, sweeping upwards, while the right wing trails softer in the background, out of focus. A subtle rainbow-like gradient is visible near the bottom left of the image. The overall atmosphere is ethereal and magical, with a soft blur enhancing the sense of movement. A white \"c29\" logo is subtly placed in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle drift of glittering particles from butterfly wings, cascading downwards. Gentle, almost imperceptible light pulsation from within the butterfly. Faint, soft rainbow shimmers and subtly shifts colors. Ultra-slow, gentle zoom out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Butterfly erupts in supernova of glittering particles, forcefully blasting outwards. Wings violently flap, creating turbulent cosmic storms that rip across the frame. Body pulses with blinding, explosive light. A vibrant, aggressive rainbow fiercely ignites from the bottom left, its colors thrashing and warring. The camera brutally snaps backward in a lightning-fast, disorienting zoom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The glittering particles, now defying gravity, coalesce to form ephemeral constellations before being reabsorbed into the butterfly's body, which pulsates with inverted light, drawing in the surrounding darkness. The rainbow, unmoored and shimmering with impossible colors, unravels into tendrils of pure light that swirl and wrap around the butterfly, causing its form to ripple and breathe as if made of liquid starlight.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "An ethereal butterfly, shimmering with stardust particles, pirouettes and grandly unfolds its wings. The camera dramatically swoops around, revealing the particles drifting like cosmic remnants. A gentle glow emanates from its core, subtly pulsating as it ascends, catching a faint, soft rainbow on its path. The camera dramatically pulls back, showing the butterfly ascending into the vastness, leaving a trail of stardust.",
