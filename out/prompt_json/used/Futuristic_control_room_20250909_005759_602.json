    "video_prompt": "From the perspective of the seated pilot, the large helicopter visible through the cockpit window slightly sways as its blades subtly turn, casting faint, shifting shadows on the snow-covered mountains in the distance. The pilot's chest gently rises and falls with a breathing motion, and the sleeves of their red suit show subtle creases and fabric shifts. The lights and displays on the instrument panel in front of them flicker with a gentle, ambient glow, and some of the data readouts on the screens show minor, continuous changes. Outside, the harsh sunlight causes subtle gleams and reflections off the window and the metal structure of the orange building in the background.",
    "image_prompt": "Full body shot from inside a cockpit, high angle view, looking over the shoulder of a person in a red spacesuit with a helmet, seated at the controls of a futuristic vehicle. The person's back is to the viewer, and they are looking out a large window at a snowy, mountainous landscape under a clear sky. A grey, futuristic-looking helicopter with multiple propellers is hovering in the mid-ground. In the background, there's a large, orange, multi-story futuristic building or base on the snowy ground. The cockpit interior is detailed with luminous digital displays showing various data and maps. The overall aesthetic is sci-fi and realistic, with clear, bright lighting, sharp focus, and a cool, tranquil atmosphere.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The helicopter subtly sways, its blades turning gently, casting shifting shadows on distant snowy peaks. The pilot's chest slowly rises and falls, their red suit subtly creasing. Instrument panel lights flicker, data readouts continuously change. Outside, sunlight gleams and reflects off the window and the orange building's metal structure.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "From the cockpit, the large helicopter suddenly plunges, rotor blades violently thrashing, sending massive snow plumes blasting across the mountains. The pilot's body jolts erratically, red suit rippling as if struck by an invisible force. Instrument panels explode with flashing lights, screens shattering. Outside, the orange building shudders, its entire structure twisting and collapsing, while the snow-covered ground cracks open revealing fiery, glowing fissures.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Within the cockpit, the pilot's red suit ripples like liquid, morphing into crimson mist that dissipates then coalesces, while digits on the glowing console count backward, then burst into abstract patterns. Outside, the large helicopter dissolves into a flock of luminescent birds, flying in reverse formation, as the snowy mountains ripple like ocean waves, revealing fleeting glimpses of an ancient, impossible city beneath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "From the pilot's POV, the hovering helicopter subtly *tilts*, its blades *casting dramatic, swirling shadows* across the snow. A *slow, unsettling zoom-in* highlights the pilot's steady breath, their gloved hands *gripping the glowing controls*. The *distant orange structure flickers* as the helicopter *banks sharply*, revealing *gleaming ice peaks* under a *cracked, shifting sky*. The cockpit *lights intensify*, reflecting in the pilot's helmet, hinting at an unknown, impending mission.",
