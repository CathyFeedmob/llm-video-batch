    "video_prompt": "Glowing particles gently drift and scatter with subtle heat distortion, adding to the hazy smoke. The dragon's blue eyes softly pulsate, reflecting an internal light. Small, sharp fragments in the foreground and midground rotate and tumble slowly, catching glints of light. A very subtle, slow zoom out reveals more of the surrounding chaotic environment.",
    "image_prompt": "digital painting of a futuristic, menacing dragon with a faceted, iridescent, dark blue and purple body resembling shattered glass or gemstones, glowing blue eyes, and large horns, emerging from dynamic clouds and smoke. The composition is a low-angle shot, focusing on the dragon's head and front claw as it descends. The atmosphere is dramatic with bright orange and yellow light emanating from explosions and sparks, contrasting with the dark clouds and structures in the background. Scattered debris, resembling shattered black fragments, floats in the air. The overall style is reminiscent of highly detailed fantasy realism with a touch of science fiction. The lighting creates strong highlights on the dragon's scales and intense glows from the explosions.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Glowing particles softly disperse and shimmer with heat distortion as hazy smoke billows. The dragon's blue eyes subtly expand and contract with internal light. Sharp fragments in the foreground and midground slowly rotate and tumble, reflecting fleeting glints. A gradual, imperceptible zoom out unveils more of the chaotic surroundings.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The dragon's faceted body shatters and reforms, shedding shards that explode outwards. Its eyes blaze, unleashing bursts of light that distort the smoky air. Debris in the foreground and midground spin violently, then whip past the viewer. Sparks erupt from its scales, igniting explosive plumes of smoke as the camera aggressively zooms and rotates around it!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A time-warped vortex spirals around the crystal dragon, causing its blue eyes to unfurl into flowing ribbons of pure light that ascend like smoke tendrils, defying gravity. Shards of its scales detach and morph into pixelated butterflies that flutter backward through dissolving clouds, while a symphony of invisible hands sculpts the background city into liquid neon dreams. The dragon's roar reverses, suctioning all loose particles and light back into its chest, leaving an echoing void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in on the glowing shards of the fragmented dragon reveals its pulsating blue eyes. As it roars, the camera spirals amidst a cloud of swirling smoke and debris, highlighting the intense heat distortion. The dragon's powerful claw smashes against the ground, causing the scattered fragments to intensify their tumbling. A sudden, wide-angle shot unveils the chaotic, burning environment before a final, lingering zoom out on the dragon's imposing silhouette.",
