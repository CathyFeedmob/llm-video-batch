  "video_prompt": "A colossal futuristic city floats above slowly swirling and drifting clouds. Its outer platform's blue and teal lights subtly pulse. Below, a small disc-shaped craft hovers over a barren landscape, continuously emitting a plume of exhaust. The hazy, golden atmosphere subtly shifts and glows. The city's lower reflection shimmers, indicating gentle atmospheric undulations beneath the structure.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to extremely concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Comprehensive):**\n\"Awe-inspiring colossal sci-fi city floating high above an arid desert planet, framed by immense, concentric, vertical golden-brown engineered rings. The city is a magnificent circular platform of densely packed, intricate Gothic-Art Deco fusion spires, metallic golden-bronze, punctuated by glowing blue lights, with a perfect reflection below. Hazy atmosphere: dusty brown-reddish-purple sky transitioning to golden-orange with a pale blue horizon band, thick swirling clouds below, and a barren sandy desert planet surface. A small disc-shaped craft with an exhaust plume hovers over the ground for scale. Soft, diffuse, warm golden light from the upper left. Grand sci-fi art.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Balanced Conciseness):**\n\"Colossal futuristic city floating above a desert planet, framed by immense, concentric, vertical golden-brown rings. The city is a circular platform of intricate, metallic Gothic-Art Deco spires with glowing blue lights, perfectly reflected below. Hazy atmosphere, dusty brown-reddish-purple to golden-orange sky, pale blue horizon, thick swirling clouds, barren desert ground. Small disc-shaped craft for scale. Soft, warm golden light. Grand sci-fi, epic scale.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Highly Concise):**\n\"Colossal floating sci-fi city with intricate Gothic-Art Deco golden-bronze spires and blue lights, perfectly reflected. Framed by massive, concentric, vertical engineered rings. Above an arid desert planet with swirling clouds. Hazy, dusty brown-reddish-purple and golden-orange sky. Soft, warm golden light.
