    "video_prompt": "The powerful locomotive rumbles forward, its headlamps casting a dynamic glow that slightly flickers. Sparks fly from the wheels onto the tracks as it picks up speed across the dusty, rocky terrain. In the background, the mesmerizing blue vortex subtly pulsates and shifts, drawing in small debris that spirals and twinkles around it. A faint hazy glow surrounds the train, indicating movement and speed.",
    "image_prompt": "A dynamic and dramatic train shot, with a heavy-duty, blue and yellow locomotive at the forefront, moving rapidly towards the viewer from a low-angle perspective. The train occupies the majority of the lower half of the frame, detailed with weathering and illuminated headlights, creating motion blur around the wheels and tracks. Behind the train, a massive, glowing blue and black circular portal or vortex dominates the background, emanating an ethereal light that casts dramatic shadows and highlights on the train and surroundings. Debris and particles in various sizes are being pulled into or ejected from the vortex, adding to the chaotic and energetic atmosphere. Streaks of bright orange light, perhaps sparks or energy discharges, crisscross the scene, enhancing the sense of speed and danger. The overall color palette is dominated by deep blues, blacks, with accents of yellow, white, and intense orange. The lighting is harsh and dramatic, highlighting the train and the swirling vortex. The composition is strong, drawing the eye directly to the train and then into the swirling abyss behind it. The style is hyper-realistic with a touch of science fiction or fantasy. The atmosphere is tense, thrilling, and otherworldly. \"AI生成\" in white text at the top left. \"@C29\" in white text at the bottom right.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The locomotive surges forward, headlights oscillating. Sparks erupt from its accelerating wheels. The dusty terrain blurs past as the background's blue vortex subtly pulsates, drawing in spiraling, twinkling debris. A faint glow trails the speeding train.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Ferocious locomotive violently rips through reality, spewing raw sparks as the tracks buckle and twist. The colossal blue vortex EXPLODES inward, swallowing debris and violently pulsating. Gravity destabilizes: rocks defy physics, objects shatter mid-air. The train jolts and warps, its headlamps strobing erratically as it hurtles through the chaotic, churning abyss.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A spectral train, its headlamps burning with ethereal light, reverses into a shimmering azure vortex that pulls time backward. As it recedes, tracks undulate like liquid, sparks blossom into fleeting constellations, and dust transforms into swirling cosmic nebulae. Debris, now crystalline, orbits the vortex, each shard reflecting alternate realities, while the train itself fragments into iridescent mist, dissolving into the fabric of time.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A powerful locomotive bursts from a blinding explosion of sparks, headlights searing the darkness. The camera swivels dramatically, tracking the train as it races toward a swirling blue vortex, debris sucked into its inexorable maw. The engine shudders violently, paint peeling as the vortex's pull intensifies, sending a chilling glow flickering across the landscape. The camera arcs overhead, revealing the impossibly fast train fighting against the void, a desperate battle of steel versus cosmic might.",
