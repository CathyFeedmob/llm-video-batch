    "video_prompt": "A subtle, lazy flicker of light reflects off the metal debris. The character's hair gently sways as a faint breeze rustles through the wreckage in the background. Her fingers subtly shift as she works on the device in front of her.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, realistic, and cinematic image capturing a post-apocalyptic scene. In the foreground, a female android with short white hair, wearing an orange and white form-fitting suit, kneels. She is focused, with her hands manipulating components on a dark, metallic, rectangular device that resembles an old radio or industrial control box, placed on the ground in front of her.\n\nBehind her, a massive, heavily rusted and weathered blue-green robot lies on the ground, seemingly in disrepair or deactivated. Its metallic body shows signs of significant wear, with rust stains and chipped paint, indicating a long period of exposure to the elements. The overall scene is set in a desolate, ruined urban landscape, with piles of debris, shattered buildings, and scattered metal fragments extending into the background.\n\nThe lighting is warm and dramatic, suggesting either late afternoon or early morning, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the rusted robot and the surrounding wreckage. The atmosphere is melancholic and contemplative, with an emphasis on decay and resilience. A subtle orange glowing icon or text, possibly \"C29\", appears near the robot's arm, adding a mysterious, perhaps functional or identification, element.\n\nThe composition uses a medium-close shot, focusing on the android and the robot, with the background blurring slightly to emphasize the immediate subjects. The color palette is dominated by earthy tones: rust oranges, faded blues, browns, and grays, with vibrant splashes from the android's suit. The image has a grimy, gritty texture, emphasizing realism in a sci-fi, dystopian setting. The overall style is reminiscent of a well-rendered video game cutscene or a concept art piece for a sci-fi film.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Light undulates on metal. Hair sways with a gentle breeze that rustles background debris. Fingers subtly reposition.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The debris violently clangs and sparks, the colossal robot's rusted joints groaning as it attempts to rise. Her hair whips frantically as a gale-force wind erupts from the wreckage, sending metal shrapnel flying. Her fingers blur, frantically manipulating the device, as an intense, otherworldly glow pulses from within, threatening to explode.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Metalic debris shimmers with inverted light, defying reflection as it spontaneously floats. Her hair, woven from liquid moonlight, undulates against time, pulling distant wreckage closer. Fingers, now tendrils of smoke, reassemble the impossible device, which dissolves into a flurry of sentient gears, then reforms as a blooming singularity. Gravity inverts, pulling her gently *upward* as the giant robot simultaneously *shrinks* into a glistening dewdrop.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow cinematic zoom reveals rust on the colossal robot. The camera then smoothly pans to the character, her hair gently swaying, as she meticulously works on the device. A dramatic spotlight illuminates her hands. Suddenly, her head snaps up, eyes darting to a fleeting silhouette amidst the distant wreckage. The camera quickly whips to follow her gaze, revealing the dust stirring, hinting at an unseen presence.",
