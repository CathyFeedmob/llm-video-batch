    "image_prompt": "a full body shot, of an astronaut wearing an orange and gray space suit, with glowing lights on his back, sitting on a metallic futuristic surface, looking down at the sci-fi city that is covered with fog, with flying saucers, and a tall building with a blue beam of light coming out of it at the top, volumetric lighting, unreal engine, photorealistic, intricate detail\n  \n  \n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** An astronaut in a full-body shot, wearing an orange and gray space suit with glowing lights on the back (green, red, orange, blue). The astronaut is sitting with knees slightly bent.\n*   **Foreground:** A metallic, dark-colored futuristic surface where the astronaut is seated, with intricate geometric patterns or carvings.\n*   **Midground:** A sprawling, futuristic city partially obscured by fog/haze. Dominant features include numerous skyscrapers of varying heights, some with glowing windows and futuristic architectural details. One very tall, prominent skyscraper dominates the right side of the image, emitting a powerful blue light beam upwards from its apex. Several flying saucer-like vehicles are visible in the sky, some with glowing lights.\n*   **Background:** Hazy sky with scattered clouds, indicating either dawn or dusk due to the soft light and subtle color gradient (faint orange/pink hues near the horizon).\n*   **Key objects:** Space suit, metallic platform, futuristic buildings, flying saucers, light beam, clouds.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Photorealistic with a touch of sci-fi fantasy.\n*   Highly detailed, intricate architectural and suit designs.\n*   Inspired by \"Unreal Engine\" aesthetics, suggesting a high-quality 3D render.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The astronaut is positioned slightly off-center to the left, and the tall building is on the right, creating a balanced composition.\n*   **Leading Lines:** The lines of the metallic platform lead the eye towards the city.\n*   **Depth:** Strong sense of depth achieved through atmospheric perspective (fog/haze over the city) and varying scales of buildings.\n*   **Perspective:** Elevated viewpoint, looking down at the city.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Cool blues (sky, light beam, city lights, fog) and grays (buildings, clouds, metallic surface).\n*   **Accent:** Warm oranges and browns (astronaut's suit), vibrant blues, purples, and greens (city lights, glowing elements on the suit and vehicles).\n*   **Sky:** Faint gradient from light blue to a very subtle warm hue (pink/orange) near the horizon.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Source:** Primary light source seems to be from within the scene: the glowing light beam from the tall building, and various lights from the city and vehicles.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Strong volumetric lighting, especially from the blue beam, illuminating the clouds and creating glows around other light sources.\n*   **Time of Day:** Appears to be either early morning or late evening/dusk, given the sky colors and the widespread city lights.\n*   **Reflections/Glows:** Noticeable glows from lights on the astronaut's suit, the flying saucers, and the individual building windows.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Contemplative, awe-inspiring, futuristic, somewhat melancholic due to the solitary figure and vast cityscape shrouded in haze.\n*   **Feeling:** A sense of future exploration, advanced civilization, and perhaps a touch of solitude in a grand urban environment.\n*   **Weather:** Overcast/cloudy sky with significant atmospheric haze or fog over the city.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle up/down camera sway. Lights on astronaut/buildings gently pulsate. Distant UFOs drift slowly across the sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Prompt:** A sudden, violent camera lurch, sending the skyline into a dizzying spin. The astronaut's suit lights flare erratically, *THEN EXPLODE* into streams of raw energy. UFOs SWARM the frame, their undersides blasting light. Buildings RIPGLOW with shifting, chaotic patterns, as a massive central tower **IGNITES** with an upward beam that PULSES with terrifying intensity. Distant structures visibly SHUDDER and TWIST in the raw energy as if on the verge of COLLAPSE.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity shimmers, turning the city upside down as water falls from the sky into pools on the building roofs. The astronaut's suit glows pulsed with the breathing of a gigantic cosmic being. UFOs morph into shimmering clouds, then back to ships, echoing the city's vertical ascent. The central tower becomes a colossal tuning fork, vibrating light across the impossible sky, with \"alien messages\" in the clouds, and stars as musical notes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, cinematic zoom out reveals a solitary astronaut perched on a neon-lit skyscraper, helmet glowing. UFOs drift like silent predators across the darkening sky. A subtle up/down camera movement mimics a gentle breath as the city hums with vibrant, pulsing lights, the air thick with mystery.",
