    "video_prompt": "A subtle, slow pan upward, revealing the full imposing height of the mech against the minimal grey sky. The glowing green elements within the cockpit flicker gently, reflecting on the occupant's face as her eyes blink slowly. Micro-dust motes float and drift around the mech's legs on the lunar surface.",
    "image_prompt": "A full shot of an imposing bipedal mech standing on a desolate, rocky, grey lunar landscape. The mech is predominantly dark grey and black with intricate mechanical details, wires, and actuators visible throughout its limbs and torso. Its head is a large, ovular, white and clear green-tinted glass cockpit, revealing a fair-skinned female pilot with blonde hair and a light green outfit, seated comfortably inside, surrounded by glowing green futuristic displays. The mech’s posture suggests readiness or a paused movement, with its large, multi-jointed legs and arms. In the distance, faint structures and small figures provide a sense of scale, highlighting the mech's immense size. The lighting is diffused and even, suggesting either a high-altitude sun or an artificial light source, casting subtle shadows on the gritty terrain. The atmosphere is stark and sterile, characteristic of an extraterrestrial environment. The overall aesthetic is sci-fi, realistic rendering, with a focus on detailed machinery and subtle environmental textures.\n**Composition:** Full body shot, portrait orientation, the mech dominates the frame, with the horizon line low.\n**Lighting:** Soft, even, overhead light, minimal harsh shadows.\n**Colors:** Dominant dark grey, black, white, and neon green accents. Desaturated background.\n**Style:** Sci-fi, futuristic, mech, detailed render.\n**Atmosphere:** Desolate, impressive, advanced technology.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle, slow upward pan. Mech's green cockpit lights flicker, reflecting on occupant's blinking eyes. Micro-dust motes drift around mech's legs.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal mech lurches forward, its heavy footsteps tearing craters in the lunar surface as the cockpit's emerald light flares violently, reflecting a sudden grimace on the pilot's face. Robotic arms *snap* into attacking positions, fingers *clench* into fists, and the ground *trembles* as the mech prepares to charge, kicking up explosive clouds of dust.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The mech's legs ripple like liquid, merging with the lunar surface. The pilot's reflection shimmers outward, forming glowing green dust motes that float upward, coalescing around the mech's head. The entire machine slowly exhales, shrinking into a shimmering, bioluminescent orb that drifts away into the starry void, leaving behind a sky of impossible colors. Gravity dissolves, and the pilot's eyes blink backward through time.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The mech stands colossal on the barren moon, a subtle, slow pan upward reveals its imposing height against the minimal grey sky. Inside the cockpit, glowing green elements flicker, reflecting on the occupant's serene face. Her eyes blink slowly, a moment of stillness before a dramatic tilt-up reveals the vast emptiness of space beyond. Micro-dust motes drift around the mech's legs on the lunar surface, a silent testament to its monumental presence.",
