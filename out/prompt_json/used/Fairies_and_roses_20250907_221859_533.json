    "video_prompt": "A gentle shimmer emanates from the fairies' wings, subtly fluttering. The light source within the large yellow rose softly pulsates, casting a delicate glow. Individual petals on all roses gently unfurl minute by minute, as if in slow bloom. A soft breeze subtly stirs the leaves around the base of the roses. The small fairies' heads turn and tilt almost imperceptibly, their eyes occasionally blinking.",
    "image_prompt": "A dreamy vertical composition of an enchanted fairy garden rendered in a 3D animation style. Dominant colors are soft pastels including lavender, blush pink, cream, light yellow, and periwinkle blues. The background features a subtle gradient of these colors with vertical streaking textures, resembling soft, atmospheric light filtering through. \n\nIn the foreground and midground, several stylized resin-like roses in various sizes and shades of white, cream, and lavender pink are arranged. Some roses are fully bloomed, others are budding. Surrounding the roses are delicate, light-colored leaves and long, slender stems.\n\nScattered amongst the roses are numerous small, childlike fairy figures with delicate wings, a few with butterfly-like wings, in soft pink and cream tones. They are depicted in various playful poses, interacting with each other and their surroundings, conveying a sense of whimsy and innocence. The lighting is soft and ethereal, with a warm glow emanating from the larger cream-colored roses, creating gentle highlights and shadows on the figures and flowers. The overall atmosphere is magical, serene, and calming.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Fairies' wings subtly shimmer and flutter. The yellow rose's light source softly pulsates. Rose petals gradually unfurl. Leaves subtly stir in a breeze. Fairies' heads imperceptibly turn, tilt, and their eyes occasionally blink.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Fairies' wings violently rip the air, generating hurricane-force winds that thrash the roses. The large yellow rose explodes with blinding light, incinerating nearby petals. All roses grotesquely twist and contort, their petals violently ripping apart. The ground beneath the roses cracks and splinters as unseen forces erupt. Fairies' heads snap and contort, their eyes bulging as they shriek.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Petals of all roses, now translucent, morph into miniature, shimmering fairies, who ascend slowly, defying gravity, their wings beating in reverse. The yellow rose's light pulsates  outward, painting the scene in impossible spectral hues that bleed into reality. Leaves grow and retract spontaneously between realms, hinting at unseen dimensions. The original fairies, now rigid statues, slowly crumble to dust, which then reassembles into blossoming roses.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, cinematic zoom-in reveals the ethereal fairies. Their wings, illuminated by a pulsating yellow rose, unfurl with a delicate shimmer. The camera pans across, capturing individual rose petals subtly blooming. A gentle breeze stirs the leaves, creating a soft rustle. Fairies' heads subtly tilt, eyes blinking in unison as a dramatic shaft of light engulfs the scene, fading to black.",
