    "video_prompt": "A slight mist drifts through the giant trees in the background, subtly obscuring and revealing their upper sections. Gentle breezes cause the leaves and small branches of the vegetation growing on the \"tree-house\" structure and in the foreground to sway almost imperceptibly. A soft, warm glow pulsates slightly around the interior lights of the structure, mimicking the flicker of real lamplight. The camera slowly pans upward, revealing more of the structure's height and the misty forest canopy.",
    "image_prompt": "A fantastical, organic architecture building resembling stacked tree fungi or a multi-tiered treehouse, set within a lush, mystical ancient forest. The building has smooth, curving, ribbed concrete or stone surfaces in muted greens and grays, with various levels featuring large, curved panoramic windows that glow with warm interior light, revealing modern office or living spaces. Some windows are circular or oval-shaped cutouts. Green foliage and small trees are integrated into and grow on the different levels and balconies of the structure, blending it with the surrounding nature. The forest background is dominated by towering, slender trees with light-colored bark, shrouded in a soft, misty atmosphere that evokes a sense of depth and ethereal beauty. A rocky, moss-covered ground with lush undergrowth and possibly steps leading up to the structure is visible at the base. The lighting is soft and diffused, enhanced by the internal warm glow from the building, creating a serene and otherworldly ambiance. The overall style is a blend of futuristic, biomorphic design and fantasy art.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Mist subtly shifts, revealing and concealing distant tree-tops. Foreground vegetation gently sways. Interior lights softly pulsate. Camera slowly pans upward, revealing more structure and forest.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "\"The colossal 'tree-house' structure violently lurches and twists, its organic branches snapping like whips as rooms spin rapidly. Vines explode from its base, choking the foreground foliage. The background trees ripple and contort, their upper sections violently sucked into swirling mist. Interior lights spontaneously flare and extinguish as the camera aggressively zooms and cuts, mimicking a chaotic, supernatural force tearing through the ancient forest.\"",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The mist in the background twists into phantom tree-spirits, phasing through solid trunks. Leaves on the \"tree-house\" structure slowly unravel, then re-spool themselves into miniature galaxies. The glowing interior lights breathe, expanding into shimmering liquid pools that defy gravity, pouring impossibly upwards. The camera pans, but the structure itself expands and contracts with each frame, its branches twisting into pathways for celestial bodies before reforming, while the ground unfurls into an infinite abyss.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, upward crane shot reveals the majestic tree-house, pushing through the mystical mist. As it ascends, a dramatic spotlight illuminates each window, revealing ethereal figures within, subtly shifting. The light intensifies, casting long, dancing shadows of nature onto the textured walls, before fading into an atmospheric twilight as the camera culminates at the highest point, embracing the vast, silent forest canopy.",
