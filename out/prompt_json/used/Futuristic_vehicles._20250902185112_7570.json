  "video_prompt": "A dynamic futuristic battle unfolds across a vast, arid desert. Heavily armored ground vehicles churn through sand, kicking up massive dust trails as they move. Airborne craft propelled by blue jet exhausts fly overhead, firing bright blue energy beams horizontally. Numerous other ground vehicles emit orange and red energy projectiles and muzzle flashes, indicating intense combat. Distant aircraft soar through the hazy sky as smoke plumes rise and explosions flash across the landscape, dramatically illuminating the environment.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n\"A vibrant, detailed digital illustration with a cel-shaded aesthetic and sophisticated lighting, depicting an epic, action-packed futuristic desert battle. Viewed from a low angle, a large, rugged off-white multi-wheeled armored combat vehicle dominates the foreground, kicking up dust and orange sparks. Intense combat unfolds with multiple dark grey airborne armored vehicles, propelled by blue jet exhausts, firing bright blue energy beams. Various ground vehicles exchange fire with orange/red projectiles and muzzle flashes across the vast, arid landscape. Towering, eroded rock formations and a hazy orange-yellow sky frame the scene, with futuristic delta-wing aircraft, smoke plumes, and explosions in the distance. The color palette is dominated by warm desert tones, dramatically contrasted by cool blue energy weapon blasts and jet trails. Strong, dramatic lighting creates sharp highlights, conveying a powerful, rugged science fiction military theme.\"",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Futuristic vehicles aggressively churn sand, generating immense dust trails. Airborne craft rapidly dart through the sky, their blue jet exhausts propelling them as they intensely fire bright blue energy beams. Other ground units constantly emit orange and red energy projectiles and muzzle flashes. Distant aircraft dynamically soar, while smoke plumes rapidly ascend and explosions spectacularly flash, dramatically shifting the desert's illumination."
