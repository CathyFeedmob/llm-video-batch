    "video_prompt": "Subtle flicker of light across the blade's metallic surface, a soft hum emanating from the intricate golden mechanisms, and a gentle floating motion of the entire image, as if subtly suspended in air.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nSci-fi tactical folding knife blueprint and render, intricate details, highly realistic. The main subject is a 3D rendered full-view of the closed knife, showcasing its grey metallic body with prominent gold accents and exposed internal mechanisms revealing gears and springs. The design is sleek, futuristic, and robust. The blade is silver with a gold inlay and subtle etched text, sharp and reflective.\n\nThe background is a light grey blueprint paper texture. On the left side, there's a detailed technical drawing of the knife in its complete, unfolded form, showing the handle disassembled and the blade extended. On the right side, there are more blueprint sketches: a small circular abstract mechanism labeled \"Nippolad\" at the top, and a larger, more detailed circular mechanism below it.\n\nBelow the main knife, there are large, stylized numerical \"C29\" labels, one outlined and one filled, implying a model number. The overall aesthetic is highly technical, precise, and industrial design-focused. Studio lighting, sharp focus, clean lines, subtle reflections on the metallic surfaces. There's a subtle vignette around the edges.\n\n**Keywords and Concepts:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Tactical knife, folding blade, futuristic gadget, sci-fi weapon, engineering blueprint, technical drawing, industrial design.\n*   **Materials:** Grey metal, gold accents, polished steel, brushed metal, matte finish.\n*   **Details:** Exposed gears, springs, hinges, intricate mechanisms, etched text, futuristic symbols.\n*   **Composition:** Central focus on the 3D render, supporting blueprint elements arranged around it, balanced layout.\n*   **Style:** Realistic render, technical illustration, concept art, clean, precise, hard surface modeling.\n*   **Colors:** Monochromatic grey and silver with striking gold highlights.\n*   **Lighting:** Studio lighting, sharp shadows, high contrast, subtle environmental reflections.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Innovative, sophisticated, functional, high-tech, mechanical, modern.\n*   **Text/Labels:** \"C29\", \"Nippolad\", \"32kd\", \"Nipoed\", \"Nifriull\" (these are likely corrupted or placeholder, but add to the technical feel).\n\n**Artistic Inspiration (not part of prompt but for context):** Cyberpunk 2077 weapon concepts, high-end industrial product design, meticulous engineering diagrams.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle glinting across the blade, a soft whirring from golden mechanisms, and a gentle floating motion of the entire scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Blade crackles with electric energy, golden mechanisms thrashing violently as the image tears through space, objects shattering and merging in a chaotic, explosive dance. Elements warp and distort, the scene erupting with furious, unpredictable force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A shimmer of liquid light flows across the blade, revealing impossible internal gears that phase in and out of existence, humming with a melody only heard in dreams. The knife orbits slowly, its gold mechanisms deconstructing and reforming into iridescent, gossamer wings, briefly suspending the blade in a sky of swirling, inverted constellations, as gravity dances in reverse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in on the knife, revealing a subtle flicker of light across its metallic surface. The camera then smoothly pans to highlight the intricate golden mechanisms, a gentle hum rising as it does. Suddenly, the entire image floats upwards, rotating slowly, with a spotlight subtly illuminating the blade. A swift, close-up shot of the \"C29\" designation reveals a soft, growing glow from within the letters, concluding the scene with the knife suspended majestically.",
