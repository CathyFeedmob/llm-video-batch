    "video_prompt": "Subtle flicker and sway of red lanterns, gentle rustle of leaves, slow pan of camera across the scene, soft glint of light on the railings, subtle head turns and gestures from the patrons.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Core Prompt:** A digital painting depicting a bustling rooftop bar or outdoor restaurant at night, overflowing with illuminated red circular lanterns and lush red-leafed foliage.\n\n**Visual Elements & Composition:**\n* **Subject:** People dining and socializing at tables on a raised outdoor patio/balcony. Some individuals are visible from the waist up, others more fully.\n* **Architecture:** Dark, detailed city buildings fill the background, appearing industrial or residential with visible wiring, pipes, and windows, suggesting an urban environment.\n* **Foliage:** Dense, vibrant red leaves and branches, possibly cherry blossoms or similar, intertwine overhead and along the sides, creating a canopy effect above the patrons.\n* **Lanterns:** Numerous glowing red circular lanterns of varying sizes are suspended throughout the scene, both large and close in the foreground (blurry, creating a sense of depth) and smaller ones further back. They emit a warm, golden-white light.\n* **Perspective:** A low-angle, slightly upward-looking perspective, emphasizing the overhead lanterns and foliage and showing the underside of the balcony structure.\n* **Depth:** Clear foreground, midground, and background elements achieved through scale, focus (bokeh in the foreground lanterns), and color saturation.\n\n**Colors:**\n* **Dominant:** Intense, saturated reds (from the lanterns and foliage), contrasting sharply with deep teals, blues, and dark grays of the background buildings and lower platform.\n* **Highlights:** Bright, warm golden-yellow and white emanating from the lanterns.\n* **Accents:** Hints of magenta, purple, and orange within the red spectrum, particularly in the reflected light on the buildings and people.\n* **Shadows:** Deep, rich blacks and dark blues, adding to the nighttime atmosphere.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n* **Primary Light Source:** The red lanterns themselves, casting a strong, warm, and pervasive red glow over the entire scene.\n* **Direction:** Diffuse and omnidirectional from the lanterns, illuminating everything in rich red and golden tones.\n* **Mood:** Vibrant, energetic, warm, and inviting, despite the nighttime setting, due to the abundance of red light. A sense of intimacy and coziness under the glowing canopy.\n* **Reflections:** Red and golden light reflections are visible on windows, metallic surfaces, and the people below.\n\n**Style:**\n* **Artistic Medium:** Digital painting, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly textured, painterly quality. Not hyperrealistic, but detailed enough to convey form and texture.\n* **Aesthetic:** Evokes a modern anime or graphic novel illustration style, particularly in the rendering of characters and architectural details. Strong outlines on elements.\n* **Emphasis:** Focus on vibrant color saturation and dramatic contrast.\n\n**Negative Prompts (to ensure specific exclusions/avoidances):**\n* blurry (unless specific to foreground lanterns), low resolution, cropped person, daytime, natural light, muted colors, flat lighting, lack of detail, watercolor, photorealistic, simple background, empty scene, no lanterns.",
