    "video_prompt": "Subtle light shifts across the floor and columns, mimicking a slow-moving sunbeam.",
    "image_prompt": "A minimalist, modern architectural interior shot of a long, bright white corridor or gallery with a repeating pattern of tall, rectangular white columns on both sides. The columns create a sense of depth and perspective, leading the eye towards the vanishing point at the far end of the corridor. Strong, directional sunlight casts dramatic, sharp-edged shadows from the columns across the highly reflective floor, creating a striking interplay of light and shadow and highlighting the clean lines of the space. The overall atmosphere is serene, pristine, and expansive, emphasizing geometric simplicity and the play of natural light.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   Repeating rectangular white columns\n*   Flat, white ceilings and walls\n*   Highly reflective, polished white floor\n*   Sharp-edged shadows\n\n**Style:**\n*   Minimalist architecture\n*   Modern, clean design\n*   Geometric and stark\n\n**Composition:**\n*   One-point perspective with a clear vanishing point\n*   Symmetrical repetition of elements\n*   Strong leading lines created by columns and shadows\n*   Low angle shot emphasizing the height of columns and expanse of floor\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Predominantly white, with variations in shade due to light and shadow\n*   Subtle very light gray tones in shadowed areas\n*   Touches of light blue where ceiling meets wall (seen in crops, if applicable to overall impression)\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Bright, natural sunlight streaming in from the left, creating harsh contrasts\n*   Strong directional light source\n*   Dramatic interplay of light and shadow\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Serene and calm\n*   Open and expansive\n*   Modern and architectural\n*   Pure and pristine",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Prompt:**\n\nSunbeam slowly stretches and brightens across the floor, then subtly narrows as it crawls up a column.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Subtle light shifts ignite, transforming the floor into a swirling vortex of light and shadow, columns violently erupting from their foundations, tearing upward with explosive force. The floor splinters, reflecting blinding flashes of light as the entire structure twists and contorts with a terrifying, impossible speed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Subtle light shifts across the floor and columns, mimicking a slow-moving sunbeam. The light *pulls* the columns from the ground, causing them to stretch and ripple like liquid white silk, then snap back into place, leaving shimmering trails on the polished floor. The floor itself undulates, reflecting distorted light beams that spiral upward, dissolving into the ceiling like smoke. Inverted shadows crawl across surfaces, swallowing light sources.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, cinematic push-in reveals a pristine white, columnar hall. Parallel shafts of light crawl across the polished floor, reflecting off the stark columns. As the camera glides forward, the shadows deepen, then abruptly brighten with a sunbeam's sudden shift, dramatically illuminating the path ahead. The reflections on the floor intensify, creating a hypnotic dance of light and form, culminating in a subtle, sweeping pan from left to right as the final rays stretch into the vast distance.",
