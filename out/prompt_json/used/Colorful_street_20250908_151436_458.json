    "video_prompt": "**Prompt:** Gentle sway of flowers and hanging plants on the buildings. Subtle shimmer of light on the colorful cobblestones, simulating sun reflection. Occasional, soft \"flapping\" of the birds' wings as they glide through the sky. Slight, almost imperceptible fluttering of the white clouds.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, whimsical illustration of a charming cobblestone street lined with colorful houses, reminiscent of a fairytale village. The houses are painted in a cheerful palette of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and pink, each with contrasting window frames and doors. Many houses feature window boxes overflowing with bright flowers like pink roses and orange tulips. Old-fashioned lanterns illuminate the facades, casting warm glows.\n\nThe cobblestone path is a mosaic of pastel-colored stones, leading the eye down the curving street. In the foreground, red post boxes stand out. Potted plants and flowerbeds with tulips and various flowering plants add to the lively atmosphere.\n\nAbove the houses, a bright blue sky is adorned with large, fluffy white cartoon-like clouds. Several stylized birds with distinct cartoon-like features, in shades of brown, blue, yellow, and green, fly gracefully across the sky, adding movement and an ethereal quality.\n\nThe overall style is cartoonish and illustrative, with soft lighting and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The composition features a gentle S-curve guiding the viewer through the scene, creating depth and a sense of inviting exploration. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the vivid colors and textures.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings violently twist and writhe, shedding vibrant paint chips like scales. Flowers erupt in explosive bursts, petals scattering in a whirlwind. Cobblestones ripple and churn, reflecting sunbeams as searing laser flashes. Birds plummet aggressively, wings ripping through the sky, triggering sonic booms. Clouds morph into menacing vortexes, clawing at the vibrant sky. Everything pulsates with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Cobblestones pulsate, colors bleeding into the air, while phantom birds ripple through sky and buildings, their wings dissolving clouds. Flowers on walls inhale light, then exhale shadowy blooms. Buildings gently stretch and compress, breathing in and out of existence as light twists into liquid. The entire street undulates, defying gravity, a vibrant, impossible dream.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A graceful, sweeping crane shot reveals a vibrant, whimsical street. Sunlight gleams on the kaleidoscope cobblestones as exotic birds perform a mesmerizing ballet overhead, their wings creating a gentle, rhythmic 'flapping.'
