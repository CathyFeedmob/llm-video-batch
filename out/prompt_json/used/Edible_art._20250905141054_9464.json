  "video_prompt": "A vibrant, edible seascape unfolds inside a purple fruit cross-section. The miniature brown ship sails on textured blue waves, its green sails rippling. Yellow fish dart above the ship, while green seaweed and colorful coral sway. White sprinkles tumble across the seafloor, shifting alongside vibrant square candies and tiny seashells. Outside, white sprinkles ripple like a shoreline, and pearl-like beads drift across the deep blue.",
  "image_prompt": "Whimsical, edible-looking diorama of a seafaring scene inside a cross-section of a vibrant purple fruit (eggplant/fig). A brown ship with green sails floats on blue icing waves, surrounded by yellow fish, green seaweed, and pink/orange/green coral. The seafloor is made of white sprinkles and colorful square candies, with white seashells. The deep blue background features white sprinkles, pearl beads, and scattered coral, suggesting an oceanic setting. Top-down view, even lighting, playful and artistic.",
