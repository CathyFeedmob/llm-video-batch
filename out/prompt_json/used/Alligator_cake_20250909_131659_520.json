    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the given image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA delightful and whimsical close-up full body shot of a cartoon-style alligator cake, made to look like a friendly character. The cake is predominantly a vibrant, soft pastel green, with a sponge cake texture visible as a light brown layer in the \"mouth\" area. It has large, expressive, circular eyes with white surrounds and dark brown pupils, giving it a surprised or happy expression. The alligator's mouth is open in a gentle smile, revealing rows of small, pointed white teeth. Green edible scales are subtly sculpted along its back, with a few larger, defined ones near its head and tail. A single, fresh, perfectly round green grape (likely a Muscadine or similar light green variety) is placed vertically on its back, acting as a playful accessory, with another whole grape faintly visible behind it. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting indirect natural light, creating subtle and soft shadows beneath the cake, enhancing its three-dimensionality. The background is a clean, plain white or very light gray, minimalist and out of focus, putting full emphasis on the cake. The overall aesthetic is clean, charming, and food photography-quality with a playful, cute character design. The image is bright and airy, conveying a sense of fun and sweetness. No visible branding or text in the main subject area.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Shimmering \"cake-gator\" surface undulates. Grapes subtly bob and sway, suggesting gentle floatation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The \"cake-gator\" lunges forward, grapes violently launching into the air as its eyes blaze, teeth snapping audibly. Its skin shimmers with an internal, furious vibration, threatening to erupt. The entire scene pulsates with aggressive, unleashed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The \"cake-gator\" slowly expands and contracts like a breathing balloon, causing the grapes on its back to defy gravity, pulsating upwards and downwards, and occasionally morphing into tiny, luminescent jellyfish that briefly swim around its head before reverting to grapes. Its eyes subtly rotate, reflecting kaleidoscopic patterns that ripple across its surface, as delicate sugar-spikes along its back elegantly unfurl and retract like tiny reptilian wings.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A subtle shimmer emerges on the cake-gator, enhancing its vibrant green. A slow, cinematic zoom captures the grapes on its back, subtly bobbing, as if floating on a calm pond. As the camera glides around, a playful twinkle illuminates its eyes, suggesting whimsical animation.",
