Reflections ripple softly, and gold specks shimmer, dynamically altering their luminosity. Water currents cause stems to sway, and new, smaller lotus pads subtly emerge and recede on the serene pond.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** A serene watercolor painting of two prominent pink lotuses and their large green leaves in calm water with reflections. The background is softly shaded from creamy beige to dusty blue-green, embellished with gold specks. Aquatic plant stems rise from the water. Vertical orientation. Peaceful and harmonious.",
