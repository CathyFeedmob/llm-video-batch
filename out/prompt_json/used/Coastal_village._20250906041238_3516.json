Wires sway slightly in a gentle breeze. Shadows lengthen and shorten as time progresses. Water ripples, revealing and obscuring smooth stones beneath its surface. \n",
  "image_prompt": "A vivid, vertical, full-shot painting of a serene Mediterranean coastal village. Whitewashed buildings with red-tiled roofs, rounded edges, and small windows are built into rocky formations. A prominent three-story cylindrical building with a circular window and birds on top. A red brick archway, curving terracotta steps, and scattered green foliage. A small pebbled beach with clear turquoise water revealing smooth, light-colored stones. A weathered light blue wooden door with a black lantern. Bright, light color palette of whites, blues, and terracotta, creating a sunny and tranquil scene.",
