    "video_prompt": "A subtle sway of the larger cat's body as if taking a deep breath, and a slight tremor in its lower jaw as it holds its angry expression. The smaller, crying cat's tears drip and run down its face, and its chest subtly heaves with sobs. The light from the window subtly brightens and dims as if a cloud passes.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, cartoon-style illustration of two anthropomorphic cats in a home setting, rendered in a 3D animation style. The composition features a larger, light brown cat on the right, wearing a green bandana and apron, with an angry, scolding expression, teeth subtly visible, and arms akimbo. To the left and slightly in front, a smaller, grey and white cat, wearing a yellow head-covering, sits at a wooden table, looking sad and crying large blue tears, holding an open purple book. Colorful pencils are scattered on the table and in a holder. The background shows a room with light-colored walls and a window with pink curtains tied back on the left. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the soft fur textures. The overall atmosphere is a mix of tension and sorrow, typical of a scolding scene. A colorful logo \"%c29\" is present in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Larger cat's body sways subtly, jaw trembles. Smaller cat's tears drip and flow, chest heaves. Window light subtly brightens and dims.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The larger cat's body violently shudders, its teeth baring as a guttural growl rips from its throat, vibrating the very ground. Its fur bristles and expands, a sudden explosive surge of anger. The smaller cat convulses, its entire body wracked with tremors, tears erupting from its eyes like geysers, filling the room. The wooden table splinters and reshapes, pencils dancing wildly and shooting out. The window violently rattles, glass shattering inward as a blinding flash of light erupts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The larger cat's fur ripples like water. The smaller cat's tears flow upwards, reforming into iridescent bubbles that float away. Pencils on the table elongate and shrink, casting rainbow light. The wooden table breathes, its grain swirling like clouds. The curtains behind them intertwine and disconnect, then unravel into glowing spectral threads that drift into impossible infinity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in on the larger cat's face as its jaw trembles with anger. The camera then pans down to the smaller cat, its chest heaving with sobs, tears glistening and trailing down its cheeks. A sudden, deep shadow from the window engulfs the scene, only to quickly recede, highlighting the smaller cat's vulnerability. The larger cat's ear twitches subtly, betraying internal struggle.",
