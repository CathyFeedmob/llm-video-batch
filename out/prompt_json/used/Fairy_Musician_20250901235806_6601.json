  "video_prompt": "A serene young woman, an ethereal being, plays a flute, her fingers subtly moving as her lips softly part. Her large, iridescent wings gently shimmer and pulse with internal light. Her flowing gown subtly ripples. She is seated on clouds that gently shift and billow. Nearby, a glowing crystal pulses, constantly releasing sparkling light particles that drift. Jagged yellow-orange lightning dramatically flashes and streaks across the dark background. Her calm expression subtly conveys the music's emotion.",
  "image_prompt": "Full-body portrait of a serene young fairy with fair skin and dark brown hair (soft bangs, loose bun/ponytail), playing a silver flute with lips gently parted. She has large, translucent iridescent butterfly wings glowing pale green, blue, and pink with intricate veins. She wears a long, flowing sage-green gown with delicate spaghetti straps and an intricate lace-embroidered bodice (deep V-neck). Seated gracefully on soft white cumulus clouds, with legs crossed and bare feet visible. Next to her, a large glowing golden-orange crystal emits sparkling light particles. The background is a dark muted teal-green with dramatic electric yellow-orange lightning streaks. Dramatic, ethereal lighting with strong highlights. Fantastical art, high detail.",
