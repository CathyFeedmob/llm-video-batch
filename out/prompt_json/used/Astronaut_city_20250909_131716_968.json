    "video_prompt": "A soft wind causes the distant clouds to slowly drift and subtly shift their shapes. The cityscape glows with gentle, pulsing light along its futuristic buildings. A spaceship glides smoothly in the middle ground, its propulsion trail subtly shimmering. The small lights on the astronaut's suit gently flicker in sequence. A very slow, almost imperceptible zoom out reveals more of the vast city enveloped in clouds.",
    "image_prompt": "futuristic cityscape, high angle shot, a lone astronaut in a dark, armored suit with luminous accents (blue, pink, orange) sitting on the edge of a high platform, looking out at a sprawling, misty metropolis, tall skyscrapers pierce through the clouds, some with neon glows and intricate details, a large, detailed spaceship with blue thrusters flies across the mid-ground, smaller flying vehicles dot the distant sky, muted blue and grey sky with soft clouds, atmospheric perspective, cinematic lighting creating depth and volume, a sense of wonder and solitude, science fiction, hyperrealistic, detailed texture, volumetric lighting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Distant clouds *slowly drift* and *subtly reshape*. City lights *gently pulse* across futuristic buildings. A spaceship *smoothly glides*, its trail *subtly shimmering*. Astronaut suit lights *gently flicker in sequence*. A *very slow, almost imperceptible zoom out* expands the city vista.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal city erupts in a cataclysm of light and debris as buildings violently crack and shimmer, their neon veins pulsing erratically. A massive spaceship careens dangerously, its engines flaring with explosive intensity, narrowly avoiding collision. The astronaut's suit lights blaze and short-circuit erratically, their figure thrown off balance. A rapid, frantic zoom-in plunges into the chaotic heart of the collapsing metropolis.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "From the deepest building, the city below inverts into a vibrant vortex, consuming the astronaut. The spaceship's trail crystallizes into fleeting butterflies that phase through walls. Buildings stretch and ripple like liquid, their light pulsating in reverse, drawing the astronaut into the swirling sky. Clouds solidify into impossible geometric forms, then burst into starry dust as the cityscape folds into itself, collapsing into a pinprick of light that transforms into the astronaut's eye, gazing outward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The futuristic cityscape, bathed in an ethereal teal glow, is slowly shrouded in creeping mists. A lone astronaut, perched precariously, watches a colossal spaceship dramatically burst through the clouds, its engines pulsing with an ominous crimson light. The camera executes a slow, deliberate zoom-out, revealing the immense scale of the city and enhancing the astronaut's solitude. The distant clouds swirl faster, mirroring the growing tension.",
