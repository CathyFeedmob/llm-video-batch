    "video_prompt": "A slight shimmer of heat haze rises from the desert sand. Tiny flecks of sand caught in a gentle breeze drift across the foreground. The smaller droplets of orange liquid subtly bob and shift. The larger orange wave appears to slowly undulate and drip. Sparse desert flora subtly sways in the wind.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVibrant, surreal desert scene at daylight. A large, turquoise blue classic car (similar to a vintage sedan/station wagon mix) with a roof rack drives towards the viewer on a sandy, orange desert road. A person in dark clothing is sitting on the roof of the car, extending their arm back, seemingly interacting with a colossal, dynamic wave made of bright orange liquid (like juice or honey). This \"juice wave\" curves dramatically, mimicking a massive ocean wave, with foamy white splashes at its base where it meets the ground behind the car, and numerous orange droplets and splatters suspended in the air.\n\nThe sky is a clear, deep cerulean blue, contrasting sharply with the warm orange of the desert and the liquid wave. In the background, rolling sand dunes and distant, jagged mountains (some snow-capped or with lighter peaks) fade into a hazy, warm light. Sparse, spiky desert plants are scattered across the foreground and midground. The overall lighting is bright and sunny, casting distinct, long shadows from the car, plants, and landscape elements due to a low sun angle. The composition emphasizes the scale of the wave and the adventurous journey. The art style is a blend of realistic detail with a vibrant, illustrative, almost comic-book like quality, showcasing smooth textures and bold colors.\n\n**Reasoning for Prompt Elements:**\n\n*   **Vibrant, surreal desert scene at daylight:** Sets the overall tone and environment.\n*   **A large, turquoise blue classic car (similar to a vintage sedan/station wagon mix) with a roof rack drives towards the viewer on a sandy, orange desert road:** Specific details for the car's color, type, accessories, direction, and the road surface.\n*   **A person in dark clothing is sitting on the roof of the car, extending their arm back, seemingly interacting with a colossal, dynamic wave made of bright orange liquid (like juice or honey):** Describes the human element and the core fantastical element, specifying the liquid type and its interaction.\n*   **This \"juice wave\" curves dramatically, mimicking a massive ocean wave, with foamy white splashes at its base where it meets the ground behind the car, and numerous orange droplets and splatters suspended in the air:** Details the shape, color, and dynamic elements of the wave, including the \"splashes\" and \"droplets.\"\n*   **The sky is a clear, deep cerulean blue, contrasting sharply with the warm orange of the desert and the liquid wave:** Defines the sky color and highlights the strong color contrast.\n*   **In the background, rolling sand dunes and distant, jagged mountains (some snow-capped or with lighter peaks) fade into a hazy, warm light:** Establishes the background landscape and atmospheric perspective.\n*   **Sparse, spiky desert plants are scattered across the foreground and midground:** Adds detail to the immediate environment.\n*   **The overall lighting is bright and sunny, casting distinct, long shadows from the car, plants, and landscape elements due to a low sun angle:** Describes the prominent lighting and shadow play, indicating a specific time of day (morning/late afternoon).\n*   **The composition emphasizes the scale of the wave and the adventurous journey:** Guides the AI on compositional focus.\n*   **The art style is a blend of realistic detail with a vibrant, illustrative, almost comic-book like quality, showcasing smooth textures and bold colors:** Captures the unique visual style, which is neither purely photorealistic nor purely cartoonish, highlighting key stylistic traits.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Heat haze shimmers, distorting the background. Sand particles drift and swirl. Orange liquid droplets subtly bob and ripple. A large orange wave undulates, slowly dripping. Desert flora gently sways.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A colossal wave of molten orange juice erupts and crashes, its viscous tendrils lashing violently. The blue car, caught in the deluge, spins wildly as a man, perched precariously, desperately clings to the roof. Sand lashes, merging with the turbulent orange cascade, as desert plants are ripped from the ground and flung into the chaotic vortex. Mountains shimmer and dissolve as the liquid tsunami dominates the landscape.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The giant orange wave, a liquid entity, **pulsates like a living heart**, slowly **drawing inward**, **reabsorbing its own drips** as if time rewound. Tiny sand flecks **defy gravity, performing an elegant upward dance**, coalescing into shimmering, impossible patterns before **dissipating into nascent orange spheres** that then begin to **fall upwards** into the deepening blue sky. The desert flora, **roots detaching, twirls and sprouts into miniature, glowing suns** that then **flicker out into darkness**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping crane shot reveals a vast desert, heat haze rising. As a lone blue car speeds into frame, the camera tracks with it, a massive orange wave of liquid rising dramatically behind it. A quick zoom to the driver reveals a look of determination. The wave crests, sending a deluge of orange droplets raining down, creating a sudden, vivid splash as it engulfs the car.",
