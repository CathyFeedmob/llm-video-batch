    "video_prompt": "Long hair sways subtly. Fabric ripples gently, especially the skirt's hem and trailing elements. Soft light flickers from the lanterns. Tiny luminous particles scatter from the glowing ring and skirt patterns. The girl's posture shifts almost imperceptibly as if dancing lightly.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Style & Medium:** Anime, highly detailed, vibrant, ethereal glow, fantastical elements, Studio Ghibli inspired, high resolution, cinematic light.\n\n**Subject:** A beautiful young Japanese woman, depicted in a dynamic dance pose, arms outstretched, hands open. She has brown hair tied in a flowing ponytail with a floral hair tie. She is wearing a traditional Japanese-inspired light blue kimono dress with wide sleeves, intricate red-orange trim, and a thick red obi sash tied around her waist. The bottom hem of her dress glows with warm red-orange patterns and cool blue light designs. She wears light brown flat sandals with straps up her ankles.\n\n**Action/Composition:** She is dancing gracefully in the center of the frame, twirling, with a large, perfect circular ring of swirling, glowing, multicolored ribbons (hues of pink, purple, blue, green, yellow, orange) encircling her upper body, emanating from her hands and flowing behind her. Smaller glowing particles and light strands scatter around the ribbons. Her body is slightly angled, looking towards the left, with a serene and focused expression. Other people, also in traditional attire, are visible in the background, walking or dancing, blurred to maintain focus on the main subject.\n\n**Setting:** A bustling, ancient Japanese village street at night. Traditional wooden buildings with tiled roofs line both sides of the cobblestone street. Numerous warm glowing lanterns hang from the eaves and windows of the buildings, casting soft, inviting light.\n\n**Atmosphere & Lighting:** Magical, enchanting, dreamlike. The primary light source is the ethereal glow from the ribbons, the dress, and the lanterns. The night sky is deep indigo blue, filled with sparkling stars and subtle milky way dust, especially visible above the buildings. The glowing elements create strong contrast against the dark background. Highlights on the character from the mystical glow. Soft, ambient light on the street.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominant blues (sky, dress), warm oranges/reds (lanterns, dress trim, glowing patterns), vibrant multi-colors for the glowing ribbons. Subtle brown tones for buildings and hair.\n\n**Camera Angle & Perspective:** Eye-level, full body shot of the main subject, with a slightly wider view to capture the street and background. Dynamic pose captured mid-motion.\n\n**Artistic specific details:** Emphasis on the flowing fabric of the dress and ribbons, detailed traditional patterns on the dress and subtle textures on the buildings. The glow effects should be translucent and luminous.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A gentle, fluid motion captures the essence of a woman subtly swaying. Her long hair delicately moves, mirroring the soft ripples of her skirt and trailing fabric. The surrounding lanterns cast a flickering,\ndynamic light, while luminous particles gracefully scatter from her glowing ring and skirt patterns. Her imperceptible posture shifts hint at a quiet, continuous dance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The ancient city awakens! Buildings ripple and distort, roofs peeling back like parchment. Lanterns explode into wild, dancing flames, casting monstrous shadows. Rivers of glowing energy surge from the girl's hands, twisting into violent, spiraling vortexes. Her elegant robe transforms into a tempest of light and shadow, the patterns on her skirt erupting in fiery, unpredictable bursts. The ground cracks beneath her, revealing abyssal depths as she leaps into an inferno of pure, untamed magic.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Fabric unravels into starlit rivers, flowing upwards, pulling the girl and building with them. The glowing ring dissolves into a myriad of sentient particles, each becoming a tiny dancer, merging and forming impossible constellations. Lanterns bleed light onto the ground, turning the cobblestones into liquid nebulae that shift in impossible geometries. Her hair becomes woven light, her movements reverse the flow of time in a localized bubble.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping camera pans up from the girl's glowing sandals, slowly following the vibrant, flowing hem of her skirt. The camera then tracks the sparkling ring of light as it swirls around her, revealing her serene face with a dramatic zoom-in. Shadows from approaching figures subtly lengthen and dance as the lanterns glow brighter, creating a captivating play of light and mystery around the subtly swaying dancers.",
