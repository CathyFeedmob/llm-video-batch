    "video_prompt": "Subtle heat haze emanating from the structures, with a slight shimmering effect on the distant light sources. Small dust particles drift in the air, catching the light as they move. The red banner on the building subtly flutters in an unseen breeze. The distant, floating debris slowly orbits the central structure. Gentle undulations on the wet ground reflect the light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here is a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image and its crops:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA dystopian cityscape seen from a low-angle perspective, looking up towards a monumental, organic-like structure that dominates the sky. The foreground features a desolated street with dilapidated, weathered buildings in warm, earthy tones (reds, browns, ochres) on either side, casting long shadows. Debris and rubble are scattered across the ground. A lone, silhouetted figure with a weapon, seen from behind, stands at the center, gazing towards the imposing structure. Further down the street, another smaller, orange-clad figure is visible.\n\nThe central structure appears to be a colossal, dark, and fragmented entity, resembling a growing, chaotic mass of land or rock, but with futuristic, mechanical elements and light blue internal glow, particularly a large, imposing saucer-shaped section mid-way up. Numerous smaller, dark, fragmented pieces of debris or structures float in the blue-green sky around the main entity.\n\nThe sky is a vibrant teal to light blue, creating a stark contrast with the dark structure and red buildings. The lighting is dramatic, with bright, ethereal light emanating from behind and within the central structure, creating a sense of awe and mystery. The overall atmosphere is post-apocalyptic, desolate, and futuristic, with a hint of foreboding. The art style is a blend of realistic detail and painterly textures, reminiscent of concept art for sci-fi video games, with clear brushstrokes and a slightly stylized, gritty aesthetic. Vertical composition emphasizes the height of the structures.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Structures emit subtle heat haze, shimmering distant lights. Dust motes drift, catching light. Red banner subtly flutters. Debris slowly orbits. Wet ground gently undulates, reflecting light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings violently shudder and collapse, dust storms erupting. The red banner explodes into fiery fragments. Ground cracks, erupting molten geysers. Debris streaks past at incredible speeds, narrowly missing figures as the central structure destabilizes, emitting blinding energy bursts. Figures frantically sprint and dodge as the world crumbles.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The immense central structure begins to softly pulsate, emitting faint, rhythmic ripples that cause the surrounding debris to spontaneously reassemble into crystalline shards, then instantly dissolve into shimmering dust. The light from distant buildings twists and blurs into liquid ribbons that gracefully flow upward, merging into the glowing sky. The heat haze transforms into swirling auroras, sucking in light instead of refracting it. The red banner stretches and morphs into a spectral, transparent flag, its letters rearranging infinitely.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Camera** tracks a lone figure, silhouetted against the colossal structure, their gaze fixed upwards. **Zoom in** slowly, capturing subtle heat haze shimmering off the structure. As the camera glides upwards, dust particles dance in ethereal light. A red banner flutters rhythmically. **Pan right** to showcase debris subtly orbiting the central structure, reflecting light on the wet ground below. The figure extends a hand, reaching towards the impossible scale of the city.",
