    "video_prompt": "Subtle aurora Borealis shimmer and slow drift across the night sky, light glow and gentle ripple of the fluorescent river, dust motes softly float in the air.",
    "image_prompt": "A visually stunning and surreal landscape captured in a long vertical shot, showcasing a vibrant cosmic scene unfolding over a rugged valley. The sky is a breathtaking gradient of deep purple on the left, transitioning to cyan and lighter blues towards the right, filled with countless twinkling stars and swirling nebulous clouds, creating a cosmic milky way effect.\n\nIn the mid-ground, a grand valley stretches forward, flanked by towering, jagged rock formations and mountain peaks that rise dramatically on both sides, their surfaces appearing weathered and textured. The valley floor is illuminated by an ethereal, winding river of glowing orange and yellow light, resembling molten lava or pure energy, stretching into the distance.\n\nAt the end of this luminous path, a large, mystical moon or planet is suspended just above the horizon, casting a brilliant, warm orange and yellow glow that suggests either a sunrise or sunset behind it. The overall atmosphere is magical, awe-inspiring, and otherworldly, blending elements of fantasy with astronomical beauty. The lighting is strong, with warm glows from the celestial body and the luminous river contrasting with the cool, ethereal hues of the night sky and the shadowed mountains.\n\n**Visual elements:** Cosmic sky, jagged mountains, luminous river, glowing moon/planet, starry night.\n**Style:** Surreal, fantasy, cosmic, dreamlike.\n**Composition:** Long vertical shot, leading lines (luminous river), symmetrical balance (mountains on either side), focal point (glowing moon/planet).\n**Colors:** Deep purple, cyan, blue, orange, yellow, dark grey/brown (mountains), white (stars).\n**Lighting:** Strong warm glow from horizon and river, subtle ambient light from stars/nebulae, high contrast.\n**Atmosphere:** Magical, awe-inspiring, mysterious, tranquil, otherworldly.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movement Focus:**\n\nAurora shimmers and subtly drifts, light on river glows and gently ripples, dust motes softly float.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Galactic maelstrom erupts, cosmic dust swirling violently, devouring stars. Jagged mountains crumble, shards exploding skyward as the pulsating river, now a molten serpent, coils and lashes, consuming the landscape. The moon, a blazing projectile, hurtles towards the horizon, inciting cataclysmic tremors that shatter the ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A vibrant aurora pulse from the river, coiling skyward to form shifting constellations. Towering peaks, made of light, melt then reform into swirling liquid structures. A colossal moon shatters into thousands of glowing dust motes that float upwards, then reform into a moon again in reverse. The luminous river pulls the landscape into a spiraling vortex as the stars ripple like water, defying reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, revealing vertical pan up from the glowing fluorescent river, past towering jagged spires, revealing a subtle aurora Borealis shimmering and slowly drifting across the night sky. The camera then performs a dramatic push-in, closing on the radiant moon and the distant sun's glow, as dust motes softly float and swirl, illuminated by the approaching light.",
