  "video_prompt": "A futuristic soldier on a sleek hover-vehicle speeds through intense space combat. Their multi-barreled weapon fires a brilliant, fiery laser beam forward, while a cape dramatically trails behind, emphasizing rapid motion. Spent casings fly off to the side as the vehicle's glowing accents pulse with propulsion. The expansive sky is crisscrossed by a multitude of dynamic, moving pink, magenta, and orange laser beams from a widespread firefight. Dynamic lighting shifts with the ongoing action, creating strong glows and reflections on colossal, light-pulsing structures and hovering ships.",
