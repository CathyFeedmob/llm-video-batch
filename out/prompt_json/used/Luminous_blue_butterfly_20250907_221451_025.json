    "video_prompt": "A subtle pulse of light emanating from the butterfly's wings, causing the specks of light around it to twinkle and shift. The dandelions gently sway as if caught in a faint breeze, and the glowing blue orbs in the background slowly drift. The sparkling dust particles on the ground subtly shimmer and settle.",
    "image_prompt": "A magical, luminous butterfly with glassy, translucent blue wings, detailed with intricate white vein patterns and sparkling white dots, hovers above a dark, mystical ground. A bright, star-like glow emanates from its right wing, casting a soft light. Below the butterfly, a cluster of vibrant green dandelions in various stages of bloom – from fluffy white seed heads to small buds – emerges from the dark surface. The ground reflects the subtle light with scattered, bright white flecks and holds distinct, dark shadows from the dandelions. The background is a deep, blurred black, dotted with soft blue bokeh lights that add to the enchanting atmosphere. The composition is a vertical shot, centered on the butterfly, with the dandelions and their shadows forming a base. The overall style is whimsical and fantastical, with a focus on glowing light and translucent textures. At the bottom right, \"c29\" is subtly integrated in a light blue, dimensional font.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Butterfly wings pulse with light, causing specks to twinkle and shift. Dandelions gently sway. Blue orbs slowly drift. Ground dust subtly shimmers and settles.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The butterfly's wings flash with blinding, explosive light, sending a shockwave that violently whips the dandelions into a chaotic frenzy. Blue orbs in the background erupt into blinding flares, shooting across the screen at warp speed. Sparking dust on the ground becomes a tempest, swirling upward in a fierce, glittering tornado.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The butterfly's glowing wings inhale the sparkling dust, causing the ground to ripple backwards into a liquid-like state. Dandelions detach, their seeds reversing flight to coalesce into glowing orbs that drift upwards, consumed by the intensifying light from the butterfly. Blue orbs in the background melt and reform into ethereal tendrils, pulling the butterfly into a swirling vortex of impossible colors, as gravity itself buckles around the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A glowing butterfly takes flight, its wings pulsating with ethereal light as the camera dramatically pulls back. The dandelions below sway in a sudden breeze, their seeds scattering like glittering dust motes caught in a spotlight. As the camera pans down, sparkling dust dances on a mysterious dark surface, leading to an emerging number \"c29\", creating a dramatic reveal.",
