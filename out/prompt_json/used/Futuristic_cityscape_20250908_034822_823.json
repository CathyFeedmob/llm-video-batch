    "video_prompt": "The light rays emanating from the tops of the modern skyscrapers subtly pulsate and glow. The glowing track lights on the train pathway subtly flicker and move along with the maglev train as it courses through the city. The floating bubbles with faces inside gently drift in the sky. The lights within the bubbles softly glow and dim. The city lights below shimmer creating a sense of movement. The lights on the oriental pearl tower gently pulsate and brighten.",

The Shanghai Tower (left) is geometrically complex with a spiral structure, while the Shanghai World Financial Center (center) has a distinctive \"bottle opener\" top. The Oriental Pearl TV Tower (right) is a central feature, with multiple spheres, purple-lit lower structures, and green, lush platforms adorned with peacocks and other animals.\n*   **Transportation:** A sleek, modern monorail train, glowing in turquoise and magenta, glides across an elevated track in the foreground. Below, streets are visible with streaks of light from moving vehicles, indicating a bustling metropolis.\n*   **Bubbles:** Various-sized translucent bubbles float through the sky, each containing a glowing square image of a person (AI-generated faces) inside. These bubbles are scattered around the top and middle sections of the image.\n*   **Nature:** Green foliage and small trees are integrated into the design, particularly on the elevated platforms of the Oriental Pearl TV Tower and on some visible rooftops. The peacocks add an unexpected organic element.\n\n**Style & Composition:**\n*   **Style:** Hyperrealistic with elements of cyberpunk and futurism. The sharp architectural lines are contrasted with the ethereal glowing bubbles and soft light trails.\n*   **Composition:** A wide-angle shot providing a grand panorama of the city. The monorail forms a strong horizontal leading line in the lower frame, drawing the eye across the image. The verticality of the skyscrapers and the TV tower creates a sense of immense scale. The floating bubbles add a whimsical, dreamlike quality.\n*   **Perspective:** Elevated view, looking down slightly on the monorail and over the city, emphasizing the height of the buildings.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Colors:** Deep blues, purples, and magenta tones for the sky, building lights, and monorail. Contrasting with streaks of bright cyan and lime green from the monorail track lights and light trails on the streets.\n*   **Accents:** Subtle greens from foliage, and the vibrant colors of the peacock feathers.\n*   **Glow:** Strong, luminous glows from the building tops, monorail, and floating bubbles.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Lighting:** The scene is lit by artificial lights from the buildings, trains, and streets, creating a dynamic and vibrant nocturnal atmosphere. There's a strong emphasis on neon and glowing elements. Light rays emanate from the tops of several skyscrapers.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Majestic, futuristic, and bustling, with a hint of serene elegance from the floating bubbles and integrated nature. The overall mood is one of technological advancement and urban splendor.\n\n**Keywords:** Hyperrealistic, futuristic city, Shanghai skyline, Shanghai Tower, Shanghai World Financial Center, Oriental Pearl TV Tower, neon lights, glowing buildings, monorail, elevated train track, light trails, floating bubbles, AI faces, peacocks, dusk, deep blue sky, purple hues, cyan, magenta, cyberpunk, urban, modern, intricate details, wide angle.",
