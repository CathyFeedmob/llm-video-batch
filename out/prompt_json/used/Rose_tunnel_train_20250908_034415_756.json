    "video_prompt": "Subtle breeze rustles rose petals and leaves in the archway. Train ever so slightly moves forward along the tracks. Sunlight shimmers on the leaves and petals creating faint sparkle effects.",
    "image_prompt": "A breathtakingly beautiful, highly detailed, and fantastical image of a white light rail train moving along a curved track through a vibrant, lush rose garden tunnel. The tunnel is formed by rose bushes with abundant pink and red blooms creating a vibrant and lush green and floral archway, with the foliage and flowers dense enough to form a partial canopy overhead, letting dappled sunlight through. The light is bright, warm, and natural, creating a slightly ethereal atmosphere with soft reflections on the train. The composition is eye-level, showing the track curving into the distance with the train at the center, surrounded by the stunning floral archway. The overall impression is whimsical, romantic, and dreamlike. The image quality is extremely high-resolution, with sharp focus on the train and foreground elements and a subtle depth of field that softens the background roses.\nA white model C29 train.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Wind-swept rose petals flutter and fall. Train imperceptibly glides forward. Sunlight dances across foliage, casting fleeting glints.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rose petals explosively swirl into a hurricane, ripping through the foliage. The train violently lurches and accelerates, blurring past. Sunlight flashes blindingly, twisting the rose arch into a pulsating, fiery vortex as the entire scene contorts with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Arches bloom with gravity-defying roses, their petals twisting into ethereal butterflies that flutter backwards into the foliage. The train, a shimmering phantom, glitches between existence and pure light, its wheels carving impossible ripples in reality on rails that rise and fall like ocean waves. Sunbeams stretch and contract, painting landscapes of impossible color.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in from outside a radiant rose tunnel, revealing a modern train barely emerging from the floral archway, its white surface glistening under the sun. As the camera sweeps gracefully towards the train, a subtle breeze rustles the myriad pink and red rose petals and leaves, creating a soft, ethereal dance. The sunlight shimmers, casting delicate sparkles across the vibrant foliage, culminating in a breathtaking visual that feels like a dream.",
