    "video_prompt": "A full moon with subtle glow and shifting light, a few pink butterflies gently fluttering across the night sky, subtle twinkling stars, tree leaves on various trees slightly rustling in a gentle breeze, the river water gently flowing, subtle glints of light on the water's surface, and very subtle camera pan and zoom.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed illustration of an open wooden archway leading from a cozy library into a fantastical, lush forest at dusk. The archway is part of a large wooden bookshelf filled with antique books of varying sizes and colors. A sturdy tree with well-defined roots frames the left side, partially obscuring the bookshelf. On the right, another thick tree trunk with green foliage and visible roots also frames the archway, similarly partially obscuring another bookshelf laden with books. The archway opens to a vibrant, serene landscape, with a winding river flowing from the distance, flanked by rock formations and lush green trees with full canopies. In the sky, a large, glowing full moon casts a soft blue light, surrounded by twinkling stars. A few delicate pink butterflies flutter in the air. The path leading from the library through the archway is made of irregularly shaped stone pavers that transition into a dirt path in the forest. On the left side of the library, a small wooden side table with an open book rests beside the bookshelf. The overall style is reminiscent of storybook illustrations, with rich textures, warm earth tones for the library, and cool blues and greens for the natural scene, creating a magical and inviting atmosphere. The lighting is soft and ethereal, highlighting the contrast between the indoor and outdoor environments.\n\n**Elements:**\n* **Subject:** Open archway/doorway, library, forest, river, moon, stars, butterflies, trees, roots, bookshelves, books, stone path, wooden table.\n* **Style:** Detailed illustration, storybook, fantastical, inviting.\n* **Composition:** Vertical orientation, archway as central element, flanked by bookshelves and trees.

Giant tree roots frame the archway left and right, intertwining with the stone paved path inside. A large glowing full moon and twinkling stars dominate the blue dusk sky, with delicate pink butterflies fluttering. Soft, ethereal lighting, rich textures, warm wood tones contrasting with cool forest blues and greens create a magical, inviting atmosphere.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Moon gently pulsates with shifting light. Pink butterflies lazily drift across the frame. Subtle star twinkling emanates from the background. Tree foliage shimmers and sways in the breeze. River currents ripple softly with fleeting glints. The entire scene imperceptibly pans and zooms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Moon erupts, light pulses furiously, butterflies kaleidoscope into an erratic swarm, stars shatter and reform. Trees thrash, branches whip the sky, roots writhe, pulling free. River torrents upward in a furious geyser, water flaring with blinding light. Camera plunges and pivots, chaotic, disorienting. Static objects groan, warp, and crumble. Explosion of light, then sudden, absolute darkness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The full moon stretches and pulsates, bleeding color into the cascading, backward-flowing river. Butterflies shimmer into starlight as they reverse their flight, causing the trees to rapidly grow from their roots, coiling and uncoiling like serpents. Bookshelves ripple like water, their contents becoming indistinct, as the entire scene gently rotates on an impossible axis, the day and night sky merging and separating in ethereal waves.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera **sweeps** right, **revealing** a grand bookshelf. It then **glides** left, **pulling back** to **reveal** the open door to a magical world. A full moon **illuminates** the scene as pink butterflies **flutter** across the night sky, their subtle glow adding to the enchanting atmosphere. The camera then **curves** around, **gliding** through the open door and slowly **pans down** to the flowing river, **revealing** its gentle movement. It then **tracks** the flowing river, **leading** the viewer deeper into the magical forest. The camera **pauses** on subtle glints of light on the water's surface, then **sweeps up**, **revealing** the rustling leaves of the ancient trees. A final **slow zoom out reveals** subtle twinkling stars, painting a truly magical scene.",
