    "video_prompt": "Subtle shifts in the smoke above the eyes, occasional flecks of gold dust rising and falling, a glimmer on the metallic fur, slight head tilt with subtle eye movements, and a gentle downward camera push.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA hyperrealistic, detailed close-up portrait of a powerful, wise-looking gorilla or monkey-like figure. Its fur is made of shimmering, liquid silver or chrome, with individual strands visible and catching the light. The skin beneath is a deep, textured charcoal grey or obsidian, showing intricate wrinkles and folds. The eyes are a striking feature, glowing with an intense golden light, depicting complex, almost mechanical or ancient script-like patterns within the irises. Wisps of white or light grey smoke emanate mysteriously from around its brow and eyes, adding to an ethereal, powerful aura.\n\nThe creature wears an ornate, stylized crown or headpiece also sculpted from highly reflective, dark silver or chrome, seamlessly blending with its metallic fur. Scattered around the lower part of the image and possibly adhering to the creature's lower face are glowing, rough nuggets of pure gold, appearing to float or drift.\n\nThe composition is a direct, head-on, eye-level shot, focusing on the creature's face from the forehead down to just below the mouth, creating a sense of immense scale and presence. The lighting is dramatic and cinematic, with strong highlights on the metallic fur and glowing eyes that contrast sharply with the shadowed, textured skin. The background is a soft, deep grey or dark blue haze, subtly enhancing the mystical and powerful atmosphere. The overall style is a blend of realistic detail with fantastical, metallic elements, evoking a sense of ancient power and modern, refined aesthetics. The image feels cold and majestic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle shifts in smoke above eyes, occasional rising/falling gold flecks, glinting metallic fur, slight head tilt with subtle eye movements, gentle downward camera push.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Eyes flash with molten gold, smoke erupts from brows, fur bristles violently as if electrified. Jagged lightning bolts tear across the frame, shattering gold dust explodes upwards, and the ape's head lunges forward with a guttural roar, jaw snapping. The camera plunges forward aggressively.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The metallic fur unravels into liquid silver, flowing upwards to coalesce into golden dust motes that float defying gravity. Eyes expand into swirling galaxies, emitting smoke that transmutes into bioluminescent butterflies. The head tilts impossibly, as the camera plunges through the monkey's face revealing an infinite vortex of shifting colors and impossible geometries.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, ethereal zoom into the gorilla's intense face, smoke swirling ominously from its eyes as golden flecks shimmer around it. A subtle head tilt reveals a glint on its metallic fur. The camera then pushes gently downward, emphasizing its majestic form as a final, dramatic shower of gold dust rains down, settling on its fur.",
