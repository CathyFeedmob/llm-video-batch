    "video_prompt": "Rain streaks subtly intensify, glistening. The sheer hood and flowing fabric of the dress gently sway and ripple as if in a soft breeze. Scattered, sparkling particles drift and shimmer, especially around her shoulders and the embellished areas of her dress. Her wet hair shows imperceptible shifts from the moisture. A soft, slow zoom in, coupled with a slight, almost imperceptible drift of the overall scene, adds depth.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Detailed Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A beautiful, ethereal young woman from the chest up, with a stoic and slightly wistful expression, looking slightly to the left. She has striking light eyes and full, reddish lips. Her long, dark hair appears wet and cascades around her, partially visible under a transparent, flowing hood/veil.\n\n**Clothing/Attire:** She wears a highly ornate and detailed golden, beaded, and jeweled dress or garment that covers her chest and neck like an intricate collar, with more glittering gold details extending down to her mid-torso. The main body of her dress is a pearlescent white/silver material underneath layers of transparent, flowing fabric that drapes around her shoulders and arms, resembling rain-soaked, shiny plastic or silk, creating multiple reflective folds and ripples.\n\n**Composition:** Medium close-up shot, with the woman positioned slightly to the right of center. Her head and shoulders occupy the upper-middle section of the frame. The transparent veil around her head and shoulders creates leading lines that frame her face and extend diagonally across the image.\n\n**Lighting:** Dramatic and atmospheric. A strong, cool light source (likely moonlight or an ethereal glow) illuminates her face, hair, and the transparent veil from the upper left, creating striking highlights and reflections, particularly on the wet-looking hair and plastic-like fabric. Backlighting from the right side, especially from the red explosion/nebula, accents her form and the transparent veil with a warm, fiery glow. Sparks and glittering particles are illuminated throughout.\n\n**Colors:** Dominated by a strong contrast of cool blues, greys, and silvers (rain, sky, transparent fabric) against deep, brilliant reds and oranges (background energy/explosion). The woman herself features porcelain skin, dark hair, reddish lips, and rich, deep gold and bronze embellishments on her clothing. Small, scattered golden sparks and glints add vibrancy.\n\n**Atmosphere/Environment:** A surreal, dreamlike, and slightly dark fantasy setting. It appears to be raining, with evident rain streaks and scattered illuminated raindrops or glittering particles suspended in the air around her. The background on the left is a stormy, dark grey-blue sky with faint light shafts. The background on the right is a dynamic, explosive, and abstract burst of fiery red and orange energy, resembling a nebula or a catastrophic event, with radiant streaks and shimmering light.\n\n**Details & Effects:**\n*   **Rain/Particles:** Visible vertical streaks of rain and scattered luminous particles/sparks, especially in the foreground and mid-ground, giving a magical or ethereal precipitation effect.\n*   **Fabric Texture:** The transparent fabric has a wet, clingy, and highly reflective quality, almost like pliable glass or thick, shimmering plastic. The folds and drapery are distinct.\n*   **Jewelry/Beading:** The golden embellishments on her clothing are incredibly detailed, appearing individually beaded or encrusted with small, glittering jewels, catching the light intensely.\n*   **Reflection/Refraction:** Significant light reflections and refractions on the transparent veil and potentially on the rain and other surfaces.\n*   **Art Style:** High-definition digital painting, trending towards hyperrealism with a fantasy/sci-fi twist. Smooth skin textures.\n\n**Keywords:** ethereal woman, transparent veil, rain, glowing particles, dramatic lighting, gold intricate dress, bejeweled, red explosion background, stormy sky, moody atmosphere, fantasy, hyperrealistic, digital art, long wet hair, porcelain skin, reflective fabric, bokeh, volumetric light.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rain intensifies subtly, glistening. Her dress and hood ripple gently, swaying as if in a breeze. Sparkling particles drift and shimmer around her shoulders and embellishments. Her wet hair imperceptibly shifts with moisture. A soft, slow zoom in accompanies a gentle scene drift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rain whips into violent torrents, slashing across the lens. The sheer hood rips away, fabric violently thrashing, coiling around her. Gold embellishments ignite, exploding outwards in a shower of brilliant sparks. Her wet hair writhes like living tendrils, snapping around her face. The entire scene lurches, rocketing forward at breakneck speed, then abruptly twists, everything spinning wildly. The background bursts into fiery chaos, streaks of red and black erupting.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Raindrops shimmer, then reverse, pulling the translucent hood and gown upwards, defying gravity. Particles, once shimmering, pulsate and dissolve into golden rain as her hair untangles and re-braids, strands glowing. The background breathes, colors bleeding and swirling inwards as the scene slowly stretches, then condenses into a single, shimmering point, before blooming anew.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Torrential rain streaks. Close-up on the woman's face, her eyes intensely focused, hair dripping. Swift zoom out reveals her entire form, the translucent dress dramatically billowing, sparkling particles swirling around her like a storm. The camera slowly arcs around her, revealing distant, fiery explosions reflecting in her wet attire. Lighting shifts erratically from steely gray to fiery red, emphasizing the chaos.",
