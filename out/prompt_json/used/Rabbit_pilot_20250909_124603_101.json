    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt for generating an image similar to the provided one, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Core Prompt:**\n\"Anthropomorphic rabbit pilot in a vintage propeller plane cockpit, seen from behind and slightly to the right, looking out over a vast ocean with a second, similar plane flying alongside and a massive battleship in the distant background. Steampunk and dieselpunk detailed aircraft and naval vessel.\"\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** Anthropomorphic rabbit pilot, wearing a tan flight suit, white scarf, and a brown leather flight helmet with attached headphones and microphone, attentively gripping the aircraft controls. Their large, expressive ears are prominent.\n*   **Aircraft (Pilot's):** Highly detailed vintage single-engine propeller plane cockpit, packed with numerous analog dials, gauges, switches, and levers. The interior is a mix of metal and aged wood textures. A large propeller is visible on the left side, slightly blurred from motion.\n*   **Aircraft (Companion):** Identical or very similar vintage single-engine propeller plane flying almost level with the pilot's aircraft, seen from the side, slightly ahead and to the left. Its propeller is also blurred.\n*   **Naval Vessel:** Large, imposing battleship or aircraft carrier in the distant background on the ocean, rendered with intricate detail, suggesting a powerful presence.\n*   **Environment:** Open ocean with moderate waves, some whitecaps visible. Clear but slightly hazy sky, suggesting a bright day.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Art Style:** Highly detailed, painterly illustration with elements of digital painting. Realistic textures on metals, wood, and fabric, but with a slight artistic exaggeration.\n*   **Genre:** Steampunk and Dieselpunk fusion, evident in the intricate mechanical details of the aircraft and the general aesthetic. Anthropomorphic fantasy.\n*   **Influence:** reminiscent of classic aviation art combined with character design from animated films or video games.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Perspective:** Medium shot, eye-level perspective from inside the cockpit, looking forward and slightly out the left side. The pilot's back and right side are visible.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The pilot's head is roughly in the lower right third. The horizon line is around the upper third of the ocean.\n*   **Leading Lines:** The plane's fuselage and wing lead the eye towards the companion plane and the battleship.\n*   **Depth:** Strong foreground (cockpit), midground (companion plane), and background (battleship and distant horizon) create significant depth.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Palette:** Earthy tones – muted greens, browns, and grays for the aircraft and pilot's suit.\n*   **Accents:** Pops of color from cockpit lights (red, orange, green), metallic sheens, and the occasional splash of white on the waves.\n*   **Sky:** Light blues and soft whites/creams.\n*   **Ocean:** Deep blues merging into lighter aquas and greens near the surface.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Source:** Bright, natural sunlight coming from the upper right, casting soft shadows within the cockpit and highlighting the aircraft exteriors.\n*   **Effect:** Creates strong contrast between shadowed interior elements and bright exterior views, emphasizing detail and texture. Subtle glints on metal surfaces.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Adventurous, determined, slightly nostalgic. A sense of journey and exploration.\n*   **Energy:** Dynamic due to the blurred propellers and the slight banking of the aircraft, suggesting motion.\n*   **Feeling:** A blend of whimsy (anthropomorphic pilot) and serious military/industrial power (heavy machinery).\n\n**Bonus Details (for higher fidelity):**\n*   \"Subtle volumetric lighting effects in the air.\"\n*   \"Visible wear and tear on the cockpit surfaces.\"\n*   \"Signature 'AI 生成' text removed.\"\n*   \"Bottom corner text (C29) removed.\"\n*   \"Ultra-realistic detailing on gauges and controls.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Propeller blurs, water undulates, distant light shimmers, aircraft subtly sways, rabbit's ears flick, motes dance, needles tremble.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Propeller violently thrashes, water erupts, sunlight explodes on cresting waves, aircraft violently lunges and banks, rabbit's ears wildly flail, instrument needles violently jump, dust particles whip and swirl within the cockpit. Outside, battlewagons tear through the water like sharks, their cannon barrels twitching.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Ocean water crystallizes into a floating landscape, reflecting upside-down battleships that drift aimlessly across the sky. The pilot's rabbit ears elongate into ethereal wings, propelling the plane backwards as propellers spin into swirling rainbows. Instrument gauges morph into blinking eyes, observing the time-reversed explosions from the transformed warships.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Dynamic shot reveals a rabbit pilot in a rattling cockpit, gripping controls as a propeller plane banks sharply over choppy seas. The camera dramatically zooms through the cockpit glass, following the leading wing as another aircraft passes, narrowly missing. Distant ships ripple in the hazy light, while the rabbit's ears twitch, eyes wide, as dust motes dance in the vibrating air. The scene pulls back, revealing the perilous flight in a vast, unpredictable sky.",
