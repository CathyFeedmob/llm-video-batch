    "video_prompt": "Rain streaks subtly intensify and diminish, with individual raindrops appearing to fall. The glowing outline of the cat flickers gently, as if powered by unstable neon. The butterfly's wings gently flutter. The small flowers in the grass sway slightly as if in a light breeze. The glowing reflection of the cat and flowers on the wet ground shimmers softly. The light bokeh in the background subtly pulses. A very subtle, slow zoom in on the entire scene.",
    "image_prompt": "A stylized, high-detail digital illustration capturing a playful cat in a rainy, reflective environment at night. The central element is a black cat with prominent, glowing neon-yellow outlines, emphasizing its form. The cat is shown crouching or pouncing, with its body stretched out and tail curled upwards. Its eyes the same glowing yellow, and the inside of its ears is pink.\n\nThe scene is set outdoors on what appears to be a wet, dark pavement or street, reflecting the cat and the surrounding light sources. Rain streaks are visible throughout the image, suggesting a downpour.\n\nAccompanying the cat are neon-outlined elements: a small, delicate butterfly flying near the cat's head, and two patches of green grass with small, glowing pink flowers. These elements also have a subtle glow that mimics the cat's outline. The reflection of the cat, butterfly, and flowers is visible in the wet ground below, adding depth and realism to the image.\n\nThe background is blurred, featuring bokeh lights in various shades of warm yellow and orange, creating a soft, dreamlike atmosphere against the dark, rainy backdrop. The overall lighting is dim, contrasting with the bright, glowing outlines of the main subjects. The color palette is dominated by dark greys, blacks, and blues for the environment, accented by the vibrant neon yellow and subtle pinks.\n\nThe composition is vertical, with the cat positioned slightly above the center, and its reflection extending towards the bottom. The \"c29\" signature is present in the lower right corner, appearing as a white, handwritten-style font.\n\nThe style blends playful, cartoony elements (the cat's neon outline) with realistic textures (rain, reflections, and grass), creating a unique aesthetic. The mood is whimsical and enchanting, despite the rainy setting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rain intensifies and fades, individual drops falling. The cat's glowing outline flickers unsteadily. The butterfly's wings gently flutter. Small flowers in the grass sway. The cat and flower reflections shimmer on the wet ground. Background bokeh subtly pulses. A very slow, subtle zoom-in occurs.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rain lashes down with violent, erratic streaks, each drop hitting like a miniature explosion! The cat's neon outline flares blindingly, crackling with raw, unstable energy. The butterfly's wings beat furiously, blurring into a chaotic vortex. Grass clumps whip back and forth, flowers thrusting wildly as if attacking the ground. The cat's reflection shatters and reforms on the agitated water, pulsating erratically, while distant bokeh lights explode and recede with jarring intensity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Rain streaks reverse, falling *up* into the sky. The neon cat's outline unravels into shimmering threads that weave into a luminous butterfly, then reform. Flowers bloom backward, petals folding into buds. The reflection on the ground ascends, becoming the source of light. Bokeh lights spiral inwards, forming a cosmic eye. The scene continuously zooms in while simultaneously zooming out, defying spatial logic, as colors subtly shift hue across the entire image.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, initially pulled back, dramatically zooms in, revealing shimmering rain streaks. The glowing neon cat flickers vibrantly as it pounces at the fluttering butterfly. Flowers sway softly. The camera pans down, focusing on the cat's shimmering reflection and its eyes intently watching the butterfly. The background bokeh pulses subtly as the scene slowly zooms in, drawing us into the magical, rainy moment.",
