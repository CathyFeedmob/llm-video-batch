    "video_prompt": "The tiger's chest subtly rises and falls with a breathing motion. The rabbit's whiskers twitch slightly. Very subtle shimmer and ripple effects on the green, textured surface of both animals, suggesting a fleshy, almost fluid quality. The tiger's ear twitches. A slight, almost imperceptible glint on the tiger's teeth.",
    "image_prompt": "A close-up, highly detailed studio shot of a vibrant, light green tiger and a light yellowish-green rabbit, both appearing to be carved or made from vegetables, possibly zucchini or cucumbers, set against a soft, uniform sage green background.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Tiger:** The tiger is the dominant figure, depicted in a crouching or resting pose, with its head and upper body facing slightly left and its mouth slightly open, revealing white fangs and tiny teeth. Its fur is represented by a textured, bumpy surface that mimics the skin of a vegetable, with darker green stripes contrasting with the lighter green body. Fine, white whiskers extend from its snout, and its eyes are a bright, intense green with dark pupils. There are strands of white \"fur\" on its ears, eyebrows, inner cheeks, and under its chin. Its nose is a soft pink. Its visible front paws show shiny, dark claws.\n*   **Rabbit:** A smaller rabbit is perched on the tiger's back, facing forward. It shares the same textured, vegetable-like appearance as the tiger, but in a slightly lighter, more yellowish-green hue. It has long, upright ears, small green eyes, and white whiskers.\n*   **Texture:** The defining feature of both animals is their highly textured, almost waxy appearance, resembling food carvings. The \"skin\" has visible bumps, ridges, and a slight sheen, suggesting the natural texture of certain vegetables.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Hyperrealistic Food Art:** The style combines hyperrealism for animal anatomy with a unique food art aesthetic, creating a playful yet intricate representation.\n*   **Studio Photography:** Clean, professional studio photography feel.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The tiger's head is positioned roughly in the upper left third, and the overall composition follows a diagonal line from the tiger's head to its body.\n*   **Close-up/Medium Shot:** The image is a close-up, focusing on the tiger and rabbit figures, with ample negative space above and to the right.\n*   **Dynamic Duo:** The rabbit riding on the tiger creates a sense of an unlikely but harmonious pairing.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Monochromatic Green Palette:** Dominated by various shades of green: sage green background, light green and yellowish-green for the animals, and darker green for the tiger's stripes.\n*   **Subtle Contrast:** The subtle variations in green hues, along with the white and pink accents, provide visual interest without breaking the monochromatic theme.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Soft, Diffused Lighting:** The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the textures without harsh shadows, consistent with studio lighting.\n*   **Subtle Highlights:** There are subtle highlights on the waxy surfaces of the \"vegetables,\" enhancing their realistic texture and dimension.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Whimsical & Artistic:** The image conveys a whimsical and artistic atmosphere, showcasing creativity and meticulous craftsmanship in food art.\n*   **Calm & Serene:** The soft colors and gentle lighting contribute to a calm and serene mood.\n\n**Camera:**\n*   **Macro Lens:** Used to capture the intricate details and textures.\n*   **Shallow Depth of Field:** The focus is sharp on the animals, with a slightly blurred background, emphasizing the subjects.\n\n**Artistic Considerations:**\n*   **\"Carved from Zucchini/Cucumber\":** Emphasize the unique material and carving aspect.\n\n**Prompt Example:**\n\n\"A close-up, hyperrealistic studio photograph of a magnificent tiger and a small rabbit, both intricately carved from green vegetables like zucchini or cucumber. The tiger, dominant in the foreground, is light green with prominent darker green stripes, depicted in a resting pose with its mouth slightly ajar, revealing white fangs. Fine white whiskers protrude from its snout, and its keen eyes are emerald green. A smaller, yellowish-green rabbit sits atop the tiger's back, facing forward, with long ears and delicate whiskers. Both animals exhibit a highly textured, bumpy, and waxy surface, characteristic of carved vegetables, with subtle glistening highlights. The background is a soft, uniform sage green, creating a harmonious and monochromatic green palette. Lit by soft, diffused studio lighting to emphasize the intricate details and textures, with a sharp focus on the subjects and a gentle background blur. Whimsical, artistic, and serene.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Tiger's chest subtly inflates and deflates, its ear twitches, and a faint glint flickers on its teeth. The rabbit's whiskers quiver. Both creatures display a subtle, fluid ripple across their surfaces, as if their textured fur is subtly shifting.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The tiger's roar erupts, its chest heaving violently as the skin ripples and pulses with green energy! The rabbit, thrown into the air, twirls and shimmers, its whiskers whipping like tiny whips. The tiger's ear tears back, its teeth elongating into gleaming, razor-sharp blades as its body lunges forward, scales rippling like an emerald tsunami. The verdant background suddenly morphs into a swirling vortex of green light, swallowing the scene in a burst of verdant chaos.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The hyper-realistic tiger's striped skin peels back like an onion, revealing glowing emerald liquid within. The rabbit, composed of shimmering gossamer, floats above, its ears elongating into swirling vines that tether it to the tiger below. Both creatures melt and reform with a liquid undulation, their forms bleeding into the verdant background as gravity reverses, pulling them upwards, only for them to fall into themselves, reforming endlessly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide shot opens, focusing on the tiger's chest subtly rising and falling. A quick zoom-in reveals the rabbit's whiskers twitching. The camera sweeps to the tiger's ear, twitching. A dramatic, slow pan across the tiger's teeth brings a subtle glint into view, as shimmery ripples undulate across both creatures' textured green surfaces, creating a fluid, almost breathing effect.",
