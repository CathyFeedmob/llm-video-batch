    "video_prompt": "Subtle blinking of the large cartoon astronaut's eyes, dust particles gently blowing across the crater floor, a faint atmospheric haze subtly shifting, and very slow, deliberate pulsing of the light beams from the hovering spaceship.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Full Prompt:**\n\n\"A surreal and epic wide shot on a desolate, cratered planet surface, resembling a moon or barren exoplanet. In the foreground and slightly right, a massive, giant-sized astronaut, clearly an exaggerated, cartoon-like rendition of Shinnosuke \"Shin-chan\" Nohara, lies sprawled on his back inside a large, deep crater or chasm. He wears a detailed white space suit with red accents, his face helmetless and his signature large, expressive eyes looking upwards. His body is too large for the crater, slightly overflowing.\n\nIn the mid-ground, a lone, tiny, normal-sized astronaut in a white suit stands, looking up in awe at the giant Shin-chan. The ground is dry, cracked, and dusty, with subtle traces of stirred dust.\n\nIn the sky above, a sleek, futuristic, white and grey flying saucer or UFO hovers, emitting two powerful, glowing beams of light downwards, illuminating the scene. The UFO has orange or amber glowing interior lights visible through windows or openings.\n\nIn the background, a colossal, realistic planet (or large moon) with prominent grey and dark craters and surface features dominates the upper right sky, partially obscured by the UFO. The sky itself transitions from a dusty, light grey near the horizon to a deep, dark blue or black in the upper atmosphere, with subtle hints of brighter light emanating from behind the distant planet.\n\nThe overall lighting is dramatic and otherworldly, with stark shadows cast by the large Shin-chan and the UFO. The atmosphere is one of profound mystery, wonder, and subtle humor due to the juxtaposition of the realistic space setting with the cartoon character. Hyperrealistic, detailed textures, cinematic composition, wide-angle lens, volumetric light, sci-fi art, high resolution.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle blinking of the large cartoon astronaut's eyes. Dust particles gently blow across the crater floor. Faint atmospheric haze subtly shifts. Very slow, deliberate pulsing of light beams from the hovering spaceship.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Eyes on HUGE astronaut violently snap open and shut, dust explodes upwards in a whirlwind, crater walls violently crumble, while the spaceship's beams erupt into blinding, pulsating lasers, the Moon itself quakes and shifts dramatically!**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The colossal astronaut's eyes spiral inwards, morphing into swirling galaxies as anti-gravity dust clouds coalesce into shimmering, sentient flora. The crater floor becomes an infinite mirrored surface, reflecting impossible geometries. Spaceship beams transmute into liquid moonlight, drawing the horizon into a vortex, and the distant moon shatters into a chorus of crystalline birds.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, starting on Shin-chan's eye, subtly zooms out as his eyes gently blink. It then dramatically pulls back and sweeps across the crater floor, highlighting minute dust particles swirling by the tiny astronaut. Simultaneously, the camera pans up, revealing the alien ship's light beams pulsing, while a faint atmospheric haze drifts across the distant planet, creating a sense of epic mystery.",
