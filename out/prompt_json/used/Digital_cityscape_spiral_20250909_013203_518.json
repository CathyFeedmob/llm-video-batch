    "video_prompt": "Subtle glowing and flickering of the white characters, as if they are digital data being actively processed; a slow, barely perceptible rotation of the entire tunnel, creating a subtle parallax effect with the distant characters; the central black void pulsates gently, like a distant black hole.",
    "image_prompt": "Highly detailed 3D digital art, black and white, depicting a deep, spiral vortex composed of floating, illuminated cuboid blocks. The blocks are intricately patterned with circuit board-like details and resemble futuristic buildings or data structures. Chinese characters and some English letters (like \"C29\") are integrated into the blocks, some appearing to glow with a bright white light. The vortex converges towards a central, perfectly black void at the bottom, from which a single, glowing white Chinese character \"卡\" emerges. The lighting is stark and dramatic, with strong contrasts between the bright white and deep black, emphasizing the three-dimensional form and depth of the spiral. The atmosphere is mysterious and immersive, evoking themes of digital information, cyberspace, and the unknown. The composition is a top-down view looking into the swirling abyss.\n\n**Visual elements:**\n* Deep spiral vortex made of cuboid blocks.\n* Blocks are futuristic, resembling buildings or data structures.\n* Intricate circuit board-like patterns on blocks.\n* Chinese characters and some English letters (e.g., \"C29\") integrated into blocks.\n* Single Chinese character \"卡\" emerging from the center.\n\n**Style:**\n* 3D Digital Art.\n* Highly detailed.\n* Futuristic, sci-fi aesthetic.\n* Abstract, geometric.\n\n**Composition:**\n* Top-down perspective.\n* Centralized spiral, converging inwards.\n* Immersive depth.\n\n**Colors:**\n* Predominantly black and white.\n* Intense contrast.\n* Glowing white elements against deep black.\n\n**Lighting:**\n* Dramatic and stark.\n* Strong shadows and highlights.\n* Illumination from within the blocks and characters.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n* Mysterious and immersive.\n* Evoking themes of digital information, cyberspace, and the unknown.\n* Sense of infinite depth.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The white characters shimmer and pulse. The tunnel imperceptibly rotates, shifting the distant characters. The black void subtly expands and contracts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The black void violently tears open, characters exploding outward like shrapnel, then snap back, forming chaotic, impossibly fast spirals that twist and contort, illuminated by blinding, strobe-like flashes. Entire sections of the tunnel shatter and reconfigure in milliseconds, defying gravity and logic. The central character \"卡\" pulses with raw, kinetic energy, occasionally morphing into a fleeting, monstrous form before collapsing back.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The data streams, now a swirling vortex of shimmering white characters, defy gravity, ascending into the blackhole's event horizon. Characters melt into liquid light, dripping upwards, reforming impossible geometries. The central void exhales reality, causing the tunnel to invert, revealing new dimensions within its skin. Numbers unravel into abstract symbols, dancing in a silent, synchronized chaos, their luminescence bleeding into the darkness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The black void at the core begins to pulsate erratically, throwing stark shadows against the glowing characters. The camera sweeps inwards, tightening its focus on the lone \"卡\" character before dramatically pulling back, revealing an even faster rotation of the digital tunnel. The subtle flickering intensifies to rapid data streams, and as the tunnel spirals into darkness, a final surge of light bursts from the void, momentarily illuminating the dizzying descent.",
