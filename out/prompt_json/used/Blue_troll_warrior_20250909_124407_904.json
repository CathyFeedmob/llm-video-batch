    "video_prompt": "The character's red hair subtly sways with an unseen breeze, and its chest exhibits a gentle rise and fall of breathing. The earrings and other hanging adornments on the character's body gently jingle and shift. Small particles of dust or dried grass intermittently drift across the foreground. The light on the horizon ever so slightly dims and brightens, simulating a slow transition of the sun.",
    "image_prompt": "A majestic, blue-skinned troll warrior with a vibrant, spiky red mohawk stands confidently in a golden grassy field under an overcast sky. The troll has prominent tusks, yellow eyes, and pointed ears adorned with green drop earrings. He wears an ornate tribal outfit, including a fur-lined shoulder piece with numerous spears and javelins strapped to his back, a necklace of bony charms, a fur skirt, and arm wraps. His muscular physique is visible. He holds two large, ornate spears with dark, metallic bladed tips. The lighting suggests late afternoon, with warm golden light illuminating the troll and the field from the side, contrasting with the dark, moody clouds above. The overall style is realistic yet stylized, reminiscent of fantasy concept art, with rich textures and a slightly painterly finish. The composition is a full-body shot, slightly angled to the right, showing the vastness of the natural landscape behind him. A distant hill or mountain range is visible on the hazy horizon. A faint signature \"c29.\" is visible on the right. There's a subtle watermark \"AI Generated\" on the top left.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Red hair and hanging adornments subtly sway and jingle. A gentle chest rise and fall. Dust particles drift across the foreground. Horizon light dims and brightens with a slow, natural rhythm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Erupting with primal fury, the character’s red mane explodes, each strand whipping violently as teeth flash in a sudden snarl! Shackles of bone and metal crackle, detaching with explosive force. Spears from its back launch like missiles, embedding into the ground. Dust tornadoes rip across the foreground, while the horizon's glow pulses erratically, the sky itself fracturing with raw energy. This being pulses with uncontrolled, savage motion!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The tribal markings on the character's skin continuously redraw themselves in shimmering light, while its eyes spin like miniature galaxies. Its red hair defies gravity, forming ethereal, glowing tendrils that gently intertwine with the spears on its back. The fur and bone adornments melt and reform into spectral, whispering faces. The weapons held in its hands writhe like living snakes, occasionally vanishing and reappearing as exotic flora. The horizon bends inward, wrapping around the character like an impossible sphere, with stars swimming through the golden field.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle shot reveals the troll's imposing figure, its crimson mohawk swaying. The camera dramatically zooms to its face, catching the subtle breathing and clinking earrings. Dust motes dance in the golden light as the horizon pulsates. A wide shot reveals the troll abruptly raises its spears, scanning the darkening plains as shadows lengthen.",
