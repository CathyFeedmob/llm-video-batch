    "video_prompt": "Subtle ripples across the glowing sand circles, light particles drifting from the sky trails, gentle wave motion on the water, fabric of the figure's robe softly billows.",
    "image_prompt": "A full body shot of a mysterious figure in a dark hooded robe, standing on a sandy beach at twilight. The figure is seen from behind, looking out towards the ocean and the setting sun. The sky is dark, filled with twinkling stars and the milky way galaxy, with streaks of glowing cosmic energy arcing across the sky, connecting the distant mountains. On the sandy beach, in front of the figure, are three large, glowing golden and reddish-orange magical summoning circles, intricately detailed with symbols and runes, appearing to emanate from the ground. The nearest circle is bright golden, the middle one a warm reddish-orange, and the furthest one is also golden, with the figure standing within or just behind it. The ocean is in the middle ground with gentle waves, and dark, rocky cliffs and mountains frame the scene on both sides, with the last light of the sunset glowing brightly on the horizon between them. The overall atmosphere is mystical, magical, and awe-inspiring, with a clear focus on magic, the cosmos, and ancient rituals.\n**Visual Elements:** Mysterious robed figure, sandy beach, ocean, rocky cliffs/mountains, starry sky, Milky Way, cosmic energy streaks, three glowing magical summoning circles.\n**Style:** Photorealistic with magical/fantasy elements, high detail in the circles and celestial features.\n**Composition:** Full body shot, figure centered from behind, leading lines from the circles and cosmic streaks, strong foreground (circles), mid-ground (ocean/figure), background (mountains/sky).\n**Colors:** Dominant dark blues and blacks of the night sky, warm oranges and golds from the sunset, glowing magical circles, and cosmic energy, subtle browns/tans of the sand.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic natural twilight lighting from the sunset creating silhouettes of the figure and mountains. Strong artificial glowing light from the magical circles and cosmic energy streaks.\n**Atmosphere:** Mystical, magical, majestic, awe-inspiring, ancient, spiritual, cosmic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle ripples across luminous sand circles. Light particles drift from sky trails. Gentle wave motion on water. Figure's robe softly billows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rippling sand circles erupt with violent tremors, blasting light particles skyward as celestial energy streaks ignite the heavens. The figure's robe whips wildly, defying gravity amidst a tidal surge of crashing waves. Ancient symbols blaze and warp, unleashing arcane bursts, while the very fabric of reality twists and shatters around them.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The illuminated sand circles ripple outwards, not from unseen objects, but from the shadow figure's gaze, pulling energy trails from the sky downward. As light particles descend, stars briefly coalesce on the water's surface, then scatter into the approaching waves, which flow backward up the beach. The figure's robe unravels into liquid light, ascending to join the impossible sky trails.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone robed figure stands on a beach, silhouetted against a cosmic sunset. The camera slowly zooms out, revealing three glowing, ancient circular symbols on the sand. As the figure raises their arms, the symbols intensify, and golden light trails streak across the night sky, converging overhead. Ripples emanate from the symbols, reflecting the celestial light. A powerful wave breaks, engulfing the last symbol, as the figure's robe dramatically billows, hinting at magical forces at play.",
