    "video_prompt": "Subtle light twinkles in the city windows and neon signs, with a gentle, slow pulse of the red light at the very top of the statue. Faint smoke rises from the ritual objects in the statue's hands. The glowing red light from the train slowly flickers. The hover car's tail lights gently pulse and blur slightly as it moves.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed and atmospheric nighttime cyberpunk city, bathed in the glow of neon signs and distant building lights, with an imposing, multi-armed statue resembling a Buddhist deity at its center. The statue is sculpted from a dark, metallic material, set against a hazy sky. A large gear-like halo is behind its head, and it holds various intricate objects in its many hands, including one with a burning red tip emitting smoke.\n\nThe immediate foreground features elevated railway tracks with a vintage, dark red and black train with glowing red headlights stopping on them. Below the tracks and to the sides, there are shabby, industrial-style buildings, some with glowing signs and exposed piping. A futuristic, streamlined train or hovercraft with red and blue accents and white exhaust trails is speeding past to the right of the foreground train.\n\nThe midground is dominated by tightly packed, towering skyscrapers, their windows illuminated in warm yellow and orange, suggesting continuous activity. Billboards and holographic advertisements with glowing Chinese characters adorn the building facades, adding to the urban density. Construction cranes are visible in the distance, further emphasizing the intricate, evolving cityscape.\n\nThe overall color palette is a blend of dark, muted tones for the structures, broken by vibrant reds, blues, and oranges from neon lights. Haze and smoke create a sense of depth and a slightly gritty, lived-in atmosphere. The lighting is artificial and dramatic, highlighting specific elements and creating strong contrasts between light and shadow. The composition is deep and layered, leading the eye from the bustling foreground to the towering central statue and receding cityscape. The style is a fusion of traditional Asian aesthetics with futuristic cyberpunk elements.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle light twinkles and neon signs gently pulse. A slow, gentle pulse emanates from the statue's topmost red light. Faint smoke ribbons from the statue's hands. The train's red light flickers slowly. Hover car tail lights gently pulse and blur with movement.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden earthquake shakes the city, buildings violently sway and fracture. The massive statue's hands slam down, crushing surrounding structures. Ritual fires blaze, spewing molten embers. The train violently derails, sparks showering as it crashes. The hover car explodes mid-air, raining debris. Neon signs flicker and short-circuit erratically.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The giant statue melts like wax, reforming into flowing water that cascades over the city. Trains levitate and untangle, forming a swirling vortex of shimmering light. Hover cars phase through buildings like ghosts. Neon signs ripple and liquefy, dripping impossible colors onto the ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A colossal Buddha rises, its red-pulsing ritual lights casting an eerie glow. The camera slowly zooms in, emphasizing the subtle smoke curling from its hands, before quickly sweeping down to reveal a train's flickering red headlamps cutting through the hazy urban sprawl. A sleek hovercar then zooms into frame, its tail lights pulsing and blurring as it swiftly glides out of view.",
