  "video_prompt": "A serene East Asian waterscape slowly transitions from pre-dawn tranquility to a gentle sunrise. The sky's warm oranges and yellows gradually intensify as the sun ascends, its light stretching across the horizon. Water ripples and undulates, reflecting the shifting sky and causing distant boats to drift and shimmer. A prominent foreground boat sways, its reflection distorting on the flowing water. Sparse tree branches gently sway in the breeze. Haze subtly shifts over distant structures. The scene animates as if watercolor washes and ink lines fluidly blend and resolve in real-time.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Balanced Detail):**\n\n> Vertical loose and expressive watercolor and ink wash painting of a serene, East Asian-inspired waterscape at sunrise or sunset. The style features soft washes, sharp ink lines, intentional drips, and splatters, creating an ethereal yet dynamic quality with a limited palette.\n>\n> The composition is strongly divided by a horizontal horizon line. The upper half showcases a warm orange and yellow sky, with a prominent circular white sun or moon in the upper right. Dramatic black ink tree branches extend from the top-left.\n>\n> The lower half depicts cool deep blue and grey water. Silhouetted against the sky are distant boats, hazy temple-like structures, and a small stilt-house on the horizon. A large, dark central boat with an orange-brown hull is reflected in the foreground's rippling water, which features light grey and deep indigo washes, and white unpainted highlights.\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\n> Vertical East Asian watercolor and ink wash painting of a serene waterscape at sunrise or sunset. Loose and expressive style with soft washes, sharp ink lines, and intentional drips/splatters. A warm orange and yellow sky (with a bright white sun/moon in upper right and dark calligraphic tree branches in top-left) meets cool deep blue and grey water at a strong horizon. Silhouetted distant boats, hazy structures, and a prominent dark foreground boat with an orange hull and reflection. Ethereal, dynamic, limited palette.\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise, Keyword-focused):**\n\n> Vertical East Asian waterscape watercolor painting, sunrise or sunset. Loose expressive ink wash, soft washes, sharp ink lines, drips, splatters. Upper half: warm orange yellow sky, prominent white sun/moon (upper right), black calligraphic tree branches (top-left). Lower half: cool deep blue grey water. Strong horizon with silhouetted distant boats, hazy structures. Prominent dark foreground boat, orange hull, clear reflection. Serene, ethereal, limited palette.\n\nI recommend **Option 1 or 2** for a good balance of detail and conciseness, providing enough information for the model to capture the distinct style and composition.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Sunrise emerges, steadily intensifying warm sky hues and stretching light. Water consistently ripples and undulates, dynamically reflecting the evolving sky. Distant boats drift and shimmer, while a foreground boat sways, its reflection distorting. Sparse tree branches gently sway. Haze subtly shifts over structures. The entire scene fluidly blends and resolves as if watercolor washes and ink lines animate in real-time."
