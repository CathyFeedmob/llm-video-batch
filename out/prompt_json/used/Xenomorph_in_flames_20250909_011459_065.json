    "video_prompt": "A Xenomorph's smooth, chitinous body subtly shimmers with shifting light refractions as fiery glows flicker and undulate around its form. The flame-like energy pulsates with varying intensity, casting dynamic highlights and shadows across the creature's surface. Small, glowing particles drift upwards from the heat, dissolving into the darker areas of the background. The tip of its segmented tail very slowly sways, and the subtle glinting of its long, sharp claws gently changes as if the creature is imperceptibly shifting its weight.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a xenomorph in profile to the left, standing tall and menacingly, its biomechanical body glistening with dark, iridescent blues and purples. It emits a radiant, fiery orange and yellow glow from its body, creating strong backlighting and casting long shadows. The alien is positioned center-left, with its head tilted slightly down, showcasing its elongated skull and ridged texture. One arm is raised slightly forward, claws splayed, while the other is at its side, with its distinctive segmented tail curving around its legs and twisting upwards behind it.\n\nThe background is a complex, abstract, and fractured cityscape or mechanical structure, rendered in sharp, geometric lines and shapes. Dominant colors in the background are deep blues, purples, and oranges, with intermittent bright, sparkling windows or lights in warm tones (yellows, oranges, reds) and cool tones (blues, greens). These background elements are slightly out of focus, creating a depth of field effect. The overall lighting is dramatic and high-contrast, with the alien silhouetted against the intense fiery light it emits and the glowing structures in the background. Sparse, tiny, sparkling starburst light effects are scattered throughout the image, especially in the darker areas of the background. The atmosphere is intense, energetic, and slightly chaotic, with a powerful sense of movement and heat.\n\n**Style:** Digital painting, cyberpunk, sci-fi noir, highly detailed textures, vibrant color palette, dramatic lighting.",

Its segmented tail very slowly sways, and subtle glinting on its claws gently changes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive fire erupts around the Xenomorph, its sleek form snapping and lunging forward with unexpected speed. Its tail whips violently, cracking the air. Claws flash, slashing through the undulating flames. The creature's head rears back, then thrusts, creating a sudden blur of motion. Glowing particles explode outwards, dancing wildly as the inferno intensifies, then rapidly recedes around the rapidly shifting alien.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A Xenomorph's chitinous body softly dissolves into iridescent smoke, pulled by inversed gravity toward the fiery abyss below. Flames become frozen crystal shards, shattering upwards into a nebula of time-reversed starlight. Its tail, a ribbon of pure light, coils into a singularity, then unravels into infinitely morphing, glowing geometric patterns that pulsate with the creature's silent, dream-shattering roar.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle dolly shot begins, trailing the Xenomorph's shifting, fiery form. A slow zoom-in accentuates the chitinous body as the flame's intensity surges, painting dramatic highlights. The camera subtly pans with flickers of light, catching micro-details on its swaying, segmented tail. A final, dramatic rack focus hits its sharp, glinting claws as they subtly shift, underscoring the imperceptible movement.",
