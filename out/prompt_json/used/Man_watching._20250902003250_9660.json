  "video_prompt": "A dramatic vertical split reveals two evolving realities. On the left, a city burns with roiling flames and dense, shifting smoke, casting flickering light on molten-appearing water. A celestial body above also churns with fire. On the right, gently drifting clouds pass over a serene city, with subtly rippling water reflecting calm light. The planet above slowly rotates with clouds gliding across it. A lone observer subtly shifts their posture and head, deeply contemplating the ever-changing dichotomy before them.",
  "image_prompt": "A powerful, dramatic image with a stark vertical split. On the left, a scene of fiery destruction: an inferno engulfs a modern city under a sky of intense oranges and roiling smoke, reflected in molten water. On the right, a contrasting scene of serene preservation: a peaceful, thriving modern city under a clear, cool blue-grey sky, reflected in calm water. Above, a large celestial body (like Earth) mirrors this duality, half a fiery red apocalypse, half a vibrant blue living world. In the lower foreground, a lone figure, seen from behind, stands contemplatively at a railing, gazing at the epic, symbolic panorama. Highly cinematic, environmental message, detailed.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "A vertical split dynamically evolves. On the left, inferno rages: flames intensely roar, smoke billows and swirls, and light rapidly flickers across violently churning, molten-like water. A celestial body above actively pulses with fire. On the right, clouds gently drift over a city, with water softly rippling, reflecting changing light. The planet above steadily rotates, its clouds subtly gliding. A lone observer slowly shifts their posture and head, their expression subtly altering as they contemplate the unfolding, contrasting movements."
