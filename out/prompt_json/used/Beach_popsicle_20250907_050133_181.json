    "video_prompt": "A slight shimmer on the water's surface, reflecting the bright sun. The small boats gently bob on the waves. The palm tree leaves subtly sway. Tiny particles of sand and water float within the popsicle's \"ice\" body. The ice cubes around the popsicle subtly glint.",
    "image_prompt": "A dreamlike, highly realistic close-up shot of a transparent popsicle acting as a miniature diorama of a beach scene, lying flat on a smooth, monochromatic light beige surface.\n\n**Popsicle Details:**\nThe popsicle is clear and rectangular with softly rounded corners, resembling an ice block. Inside, the top half depicts an azure sky with subtle white specks suggesting clouds or distant stars, a vibrant orange sun on the right, and three silver-scaled fish seemingly swimming in the air. Below the horizon line, a calm, turquoise ocean is rendered with light texture, featuring a red and blue sailboat on the left, a small brown rowboat in the center, a white motorboat closer to the shore, and five more silver-scaled fish dispersed throughout the water. The bottom half of the popsicle showcases a miniature sandy beach with gentle waves lapping at the shore. Two lush green palm trees stand on the left, and a small patch of green foliage is at their base. Two tiny figures relax under beach umbrellas on lounge chairs: one person reading under a blue and white striped umbrella on the left, and another figure serving a drink to a person under a red and white striped umbrella on the right. The popsicle is attached to a standard light brown wooden stick.\n\n**Surroundings:**\nScattered around the popsicle on the light beige surface are seven glistening translucent ice cubes, each with tiny white specks within them, suggesting they are also part of a frozen, dreamlike environment. The overall lighting is soft and even, highlighting the clear, luminous quality of the popsicle and ice cubes, creating subtle shadows that give depth to the scene. The atmosphere is serene and summery, evoking a sense of miniature wonder and escapism. In the bottom right corner, a subtle \"c29\" logo is present in black text.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Water's surface shimmers and reflects. Boats gently bob on waves. Palm tree leaves subtly sway. Sand and water particles float within the popsicle's \"ice.\" Ice cubes around the popsicle subtly glint.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive wave surge engulfs boats! Palm tree lunges forward, roots tearing through sand! Suddenly, ice cubes around popsicle shatter, shards wildly catapulting! The entire popsicle violently glows and pulses, water boiling within, sand particles swirling into a furious vortex. The sun pulsates, emitting blinding flashes! The c29 insignia blazes into existence, then vanishes in a blinding, explosive flash, rattling the entire frame!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The sun pulsates, reversing light, drawing boats into its fiery core. Palm leaves liquify, flowing into the sea, which then crystallizes into shimmering air. Sand particles condense into impossibly solid ice cubes, defying gravity to dance around the levitating popsicle, which distorts, its beach scene now an inverse galaxy, figures morphing into cosmic dust.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow zoom into the popsicle, revealing the miniature world within. The sun glares, creating intense glare on the rippling water. A small, distressed fishing boat pitches wildly amidst sudden, powerful waves, its mast nearly snapping. Inside, the couple on the beach reacts in a sudden panic as a massive wave threatens to engulf them, their umbrella flailing. The ice cubes dramatically melt and reform around the shaking popsicle as if disturbed by the chaos within.",
