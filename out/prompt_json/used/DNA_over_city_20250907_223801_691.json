    "video_prompt": "A slow, subtle rotation of the dark red DNA spiral while the sparkling galaxy below pulses gently and the lights of the city below flicker independently.",
    "image_prompt": "A visually striking, full shot of a giant, intricately detailed, dark red DNA helix (similar to a double helix, but with a more spiral, almost Christmas tree-like shape) twisting downwards, with its base merging into a vibrant, colorful galaxy (like the Milky Way) seen from above. This galactic base is surrounded by a dense, futuristic cityscape of abstract, dark buildings with glowing windows, creating a contrasting backdrop. The buildings are laid out in a sprawling grid, illuminated by soft, glowing lights within, giving them a somewhat ethereal appearance. A faint red, glowing ring or halo encircles the point where the DNA meets the galaxy and the city, suggesting a boundary or energy field. The overall scene is dramatically lit, with the bright, vivid colors of the galaxy contrasting sharply with the dark, reflective surfaces of the city and the opulent red of the DNA helix. The perspective is high angle, looking down, emphasizing the scale of the DNA structure and the cityscape. The style is a blend of futuristic high-tech and cosmic-fantasy, with a polished, rendered quality.\n\n**Aspect ratio:** 9:16",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The DNA spiral *rotates* slowly. The galaxy below *pulses* gently. The city lights *flicker* independently.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal red DNA spiral violently convulses, whipping around as the cityscape shatters into swirling fragments. Fiery bursts erupt from the galactic core, illuminating the buildings as they rise and crash. Hyper-kinetic energy pulsates, twisting every element into a maelstrom of raw power and unpredictable motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The dark red DNA spiral, crafted from shimmering light, unravels into a cascade of miniature galaxies that float upwards, transforming into cityscape skyscrapers. These building-galaxies then shimmer, their individual lights detaching and swirling into a kaleidoscopic vortex that pulls the original DNA spiral inwards, re-forming it upside down as pure starlight cascades onto the void, revealing the celestial sea below.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera begins with a slow, upward crane shot, revealing a colossal, dark red DNA spiral, twisting into the white void above. As it reaches its apex, the camera slowly wraps around the spiral, descending into a dramatic reveal of a sprawling, futuristic city bathed in the ethereal glow of a pulsating galaxy beneath. The spiral's red links subtly reflect the cosmic light as the camera gently zooms into the city, individual lights flickering, embodying the vibrant life below.",
