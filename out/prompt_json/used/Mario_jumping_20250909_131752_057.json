    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVibrant and joyful full-body portrait of Super Mario, depicted in a highly detailed, volumetric rendering style, reminiscent of CGI animation. He is shown mid-action, seemingly hopping or running, with his left leg raised and right foot pushing off. Mario wears his iconic red cap with a white circle and red \"M\", red short-sleeved shirt, blue denim overalls with gold buttons, and white gloves. His facial expression is cheerful and determined.\n\nThe background is a fantastical explosion of colorful, glowing particles and cloud-like formations. These elements are rendered with a soft, diffused glow and appear as large, dynamic bursts of pink, purple, blue, green, and orange, creating a swirling, dreamlike atmosphere. The ground beneath Mario, and some parts of his clothing, are covered in smaller, sparkling, multi-colored glitter or dust, suggesting motion and interaction with the vibrant environment.\n\nLighting is bright and ethereal, emanating from the colorful background elements, casting soft highlights and shadows on Mario's form. The overall color palette is extremely rich and saturated, dominated by pastels and bright neons, creating a magical and energetic mood. The image has a high level of detail and textural rendering, particularly on Mario's clothing and the glittering particles. The composition is dynamic, with Mario positioned centrally and slightly angled, conveying movement and depth. Resolution is high, showcasing intricate details.\n\n**Keywords/Style Tags:** Super Mario, Nintendo, CGI, 3D rendering, volumetric, colorful explosion, vibrant, magical, glittering dust, confetti, dreamlike, action pose, dynamic, full body, character design, animated style, detailed, happy, playful, high resolution.",

The air crackles with an unseen kinetic power, making every particle vibrate violently.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Mario's jump defies gravity, as glitter particles morph into liquid rivers flowing upwards, then solidify into crystal structures that shatter into shimmering dust, reforming into new impossible shapes. His movements are a surreal dance, time inverting within each step, causing colors to bleed and coalesce into pulsating nebulae while the ground warps into a cosmic spiral, defying all physical laws.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic jump with Mario, as the camera dramatically arcs over him.
