    "video_prompt": "The city lights within the fly's multifaceted eyes subtly twinkle and shift, reflecting a gentle, slow zoom out. The tiny hairs on its body softly sway as if responding to a faint breeze.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the given image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA highly detailed, ultra-macro shot of a cyborg fly, showcasing intricate bio-mechanical elements. The fly's large, multi-faceted compound eyes are a dominant feature, rendered with incredible clarity, reflecting a futuristic cityscape with glowing, neon-like buildings in shades of cool blue and purple, suggesting a digital interface or projected reality. The eye texture should be detailed, showing individual ommatidia.\n\nThe fly's body is a metallic dark grey with iridescent blue-green accents, covered in fine, sharp, black bristles that protrude from its exoskeleton. Subtle glowing red and green pinprick lights are embedded within its head and body, hinting at internal circuitry. A bright, singular orange glowing \"eye\" or sensor is visible on the side of its head. Its legs are segmented, black and brown with fine hairs, suggesting metallic and organic fusion. The wings are translucent, with delicate veining, blurring slightly in the background.\n\nThe lighting is bright and clear, highlighting the metallic sheen and glowing elements, creating a sleek and high-tech atmosphere against a very light, almost white, grey background. The composition is a portrait-style close-up, focusing on the fly's head and upper body, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the fly in sharp focus while the background fades smoothly. The overall style is photorealistic with elements of science fiction, emphasizing hyper-detail and futuristic technology. A subtle \"C29\" watermark is in the lower right corner.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Electro-fly's multifaceted eyes EXPLODE with city lights, buildings SHATTERING into digital shrapnel! Its metallic hairs bristling, it LAUNCHES forward, wings UNFURLING with sonic force. The fly BECOMES the cityscape, buildings COLLAPSING and REFORMING around it in a frenzied, warping dance. Focus on the EYE-SHATTERING, city-WARPING, insect-TRANSFORMING chaos of motion!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fly's multifaceted eyes, portals to a miniature, upside-down cityscape, subtly ripple, causing skyscrapers to bend and stretch like liquid. The city lights within, no longer static, drift upwards, becoming stars that ignite the fly's hairy body, now resembling a nebulous sky. Its legs, like slender roots, slowly withdraw into a shimmering void, defying gravity as the entire scene compresses into a single, blinking eye, then phases out of existence.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A macro lens tracks a fly's compound eye, its surface shimmering with a futuristic city. The camera executes a slow, deliberate push-in, the cityscape within the eye subtly zooming out. As the camera draws closer, a single antenna twitches dramatically, then a leg slowly extends. Soft light pulses from within its multifaceted eyes. The camera dramatically racks focus to the intricate hairs on its head, swaying gently.",
