    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze rustles the palm tree fronds and stirs the ocean waves. The sailboats subtly drift on the water, while the gulls gracefully glide across the sky. The sunlight shimmers on the water's surface and plays across the sand. The dolphin in the glass appears to be subtly swimming through the rolling waves inside. The white caps of the waves on the sand gently move.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, surreal image of a clear glass standing on sandy beach, filled with a miniaturized tropical beach scene. Inside the glass, a crescent-shaped sandy beach with tiny white daisy flowers and green grass along the back, and two small palm trees. The beach curves into a turquoise ocean with realistic waves crashing on the shore. A small, dark gray dolphin is gracefully depicted within the blue water. In the background a sunset showing hues of yellow, orange, and soft pink. Several silhouetted sailboats sail on the horizon, and high above are black silhouetted birds flying across the sky. The glass itself has a large, bright orange slice resting on its rim, partially submerged in the liquid. The bottom third of the glass contains realistic slices of orange and orange juice, with some effervescence. The entire scene is bathed in a warm, golden light from the setting sun, casting reflections and subtle glows on the glass and the sand around it. The sand in front of the glass has small white pebbles and sparkling highlights, with soft white seafoam from the waves gently touching the base of the glass. The style is highly realistic with a fantastical surreal twist, featuring sharp details and rich, saturated colors that evoke a serene and refreshing tropical atmosphere. The composition is eye-level, focusing on the intricate world within the glass, with a shallow depth of field that blurs the distant sea and sky only slightly.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Palm fronds sway. Ocean waves undulate, sailboats subtly drift. Gulls glide. Sunlight shimmers and plays on water and sand. Dolphin image subtly swims within glass as internal waves roll. Whitecaps gently advance and recede on the sand.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Palm fronds violently whip! Ocean waves erupt, crashing and foaming. Sailboats are tossed wildly, gulls dive and swerve. Sunlight explodes off the water, scorching the sand. The dolphin leaps through a surging tsunami within the glass, shattering the surface. Waves on the sand surge and rip, pulling everything into the chaotic maelstrom!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A swirling vortex of orange juice replaces the sand, pulling seashells upwards like meteors. The palm trees subtly sway upside down, their fronds dissolving into liquid light. Sailboats levitate, then phase through each other, becoming shimmering echoes. Gulls reverse flight, their feathers rippling into aurora borealis hues. The dolphin's ripples of water freeze then burst into a rainbow mist, morphing into a flock of miniature oranges.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Prompt**: A sweeping drone shot ascends, revealing a vibrant sunset over an idyllic beach. The camera dramatically zooms in on a glass, where a miniature world unfolds. Inside, a dolphin leaps playfully as waves crash on a tiny shore, palm fronds swaying in a gentle breeze. Sailboats glide across the drink, while gulls soar high above, bathed in the golden light.",
