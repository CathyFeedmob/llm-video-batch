    "video_prompt": "A gigantic, brown-and-green, reptilian creature with large horns stands on a rock formation against a clear sky, an elaborate, steampunk-style apparatus affixed to its back. Palm trees are visible to the left.\n\n**Subtle movements**: The creature lightly shifts its weight, causing a slight sway in its body. A soft, rhythmic movement in its chest suggests breathing. The elaborate apparatus on its back subtly emits steam or a fine mist from various vents and pipes. The palm tree fronds gently sway in an imperceptible breeze. The creature's eyes slowly blink. The camera very slowly zooms in.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA majestic steampunk creature, a fusion of a large, stocky dragon-like beast and intricate machinery, stands atop a jagged, rocky outcrop. The creature's body is covered in mottled, scaly skin in shades of desaturated green, dark brown, and hints of pale grey, reminiscent of a reptile or dinosaur. Its powerful legs are thick, ending in large, clawed feet gripping the rocks. A long, scaly tail with feathered accents curls around the base of the rock.\n\nThe beast's head is draconic, with prominent, recurved horns extending backward, and a sharp, predatory beak-like mouth. Its eyes gleam with an intense, amber or reddish hue. Attached to its back and upper body is a sprawling, elaborate steampunk contraption made of distressed, reddish-brown copper and brass. This machinery features multiple circular portholes with glowing aqua or teal lenses, intricate pipes, gauges, and vents, resembling a miniature mobile fortress or a complex scientific apparatus. Tall, slender spires and a prominent, domed structure with visible rivets rise from the back, suggesting communication or observation equipment.\n\nThe composition is vertical, emphasizing the creature's height and imposing presence. The lighting is bright and clear, casting subtle shadows that highlight the textures of the rock and the creature's form. The scene is set against a serene, clear sky, transitioning from a pale light blue at the horizon to a deeper sky blue upward. In the mid-ground to the left, a few sparse, stylized palm trees with dark trunks and simplified fronds add a touch of tropical or desert landscape. The overall style is reminiscent of a highly detailed comic book or graphic novel illustration, with strong, defined linework, flat but rich color blocking, and a slightly rugged, almost hand-drawn aesthetic. There's a subtle grit and aged quality to the materials, enhancing the steampunk theme. A subtle signature and numbers (e.g., \"J.29 C\") are present in the lower right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The colossal reptilian creature subtly shifts its immense weight, causing a gentle sway through its body. Its chest expands and contracts with a soft, rhythmic breath. The intricate steampunk apparatus on its back continuously emits faint tendrils of steam and a fine mist. Palm fronds ripple almost imperceptibly. Its large reptilian eyes slowly close and reopen. The camera gradually, almost imperceptibly, pushes forward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The reptilian creature roars, its horns rapidly *extending and retracting* as the steampunk apparatus on its back *violently ejects pressurized steam and gears*, its metallic parts *pulsing with an ominous red glow*. Its body *lurches forward*, *cracking the rock formation* beneath it, while the palm trees *whip back and forth erratically* as if in a hurricane. Its tail *slams down*, *shattering the ground*, and its eyes *flare with blinding light*. The camera *rapidly zooms and pans*, enhancing the chaotic motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The creature's scales ripple, morphing into liquid gold, then solidify into ticking clockwork. Its horn spirals unravel into an endless staircase, carrying miniature palm trees that spontaneously burst into iridescent butterflies. The apparatus on its back transforms into a cosmic whirlpool, sucking in stars that glitter as eyes on the creature before it dissolves into a cloud of glowing dust, drifting upwards into the inverted sky where time itself flows backward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The colossal reptilian beast slowly shifts, massive talons grinding against the rock. Its mechanical apparatus subtly hisses and clicks, emitting wisps of steam as the camera dramatically tracks its iron-clad flank. A sudden, piercing shriek escapes its beak, eyes glowing intensely as the frame rapidly zooms into its face, revealing intricate clockwork details. Palm fronds blur as a deep, guttural growl erupts, shaking the sky.",
