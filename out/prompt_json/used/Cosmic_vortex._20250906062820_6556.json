  "video_prompt": "A swirling, luminous disc rapidly coalesces at the bottom, radiating golden and white particles spiraling inward. From its core, a massive, dark funnel of turbulent energy extends diagonally upward, crackling with intermittent streaks of electric green and white lightning. Background colors dynamically shift between fiery oranges and muted tones, showcasing scattered, glowing particles that drift and coalesce around the central, intensely active vortex.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a vibrant, dynamic, and otherworldly vertical image of a cosmic phenomenon (black hole/vortex). A diagonal force pulls the viewer into a swirling disc of golden and white light at the bottom, resembling a galaxy, with countless inward-spiraling particles. From this luminous core, a massive, dark, turbulent, funnel-like structure rises diagonally, like a cosmic tornado, with bright electric green and white lightning streaks. The background shifts from fiery reddish-orange (top left) to darker orange/brown, with scattered glowing dots (stars/particles) and cloud formations. Emphasize immense energy, cosmic power, dramatic lighting, and swirling motion.",
