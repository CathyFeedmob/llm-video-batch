    "video_prompt": "Sunlight subtly shimmers on the clouds. Distant airships drift slowly. Smaller flying vehicles emit faint, flickering light trails. People on bridges exhibit very subtle movements. Clouds drift and churn gently around the structures.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA breathtaking, full-shot, vertical composition depicting a fantastical flying city high above the clouds, bathed in the warm light of a distant, bright sun on the horizon. The city is a marvel of intricate Steampunk-inspired architecture, with towering structures resembling ornate castles and cathedrals, adorned with gears, industrial piping, and detailed metallic embellishments. Numerous arched bridges connect these massive structures, teeming with tiny, silhouetted inhabitants.\n\nSeveral sleek, silver, rocket-propelled dirigibles or blimps with glowing orange thrusters are dynamically flying through the scene, some appearing at eye level and one prominently in the foreground from a lower perspective, leaving trails of light. The sky is a gradient of clear blue near the sun, transitioning to a soft, atmospheric white and light gray with fluffy clouds that partially obscure the lower levels of the city, hinting at immense depth.\n\nThe overall color palette is dominated by cool metallics (silver, dark grey, bronze accents) for the city, contrasted with the warm glows of the sun and rocket thrusters. Volumetric lighting casts long shadows and highlights the intricate details of the structures. The atmosphere is one of awe, grandeur, and advanced yet intricate engineering. The perspective is from below, looking up towards the sprawling city, enhancing its vastness. The style is highly detailed, photorealistic with a fantastical, cinematic quality.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Sunlight glints across shifting clouds. Airships slowly traverse the sky, their forms subtly changing. Smaller craft leave faint, flickering trails. Figures on distant bridges exhibit minimal, almost imperceptible shifts. Clouds churn and drift around fixed structures.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sky rips open, buildings collapse inward, bridges shatter explosively. Airships plummet, ablaze. Small vehicles accelerate violently, leaving searing, erratic light trails. Figures on dissolving bridges panic, leaping into abyss. Clouds churn into a chaotic maelstrom, consuming structures. Sunlight pulses erratically, becoming an ominous glare.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Bridges undulate, bending impossible angles as tiny figures slide along their surfaces, reversing steps. Airships phase in and out of existence, morphing into flocks of golden birds. Gravity inverses, pulling structures skyward and clouds downward, coalescing into glowing, sentient forms. Flying vehicles leave trails of liquid light that re-absorb into their hulls, as if dreams unraveling.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Camera:** Sweeping shot ascends from cloud level, revealing the towering cityscape. It dramatically zooms past a soaring airship, its engines glowing intensely. The camera then pivots, following a small, nimble vehicle as it weaves through the elaborate bridge structures, its light trail pulsating.\n**Environment:** Sunlight intensifies, casting dramatic shadows. Clouds swirl, creating a dynamic backdrop as the structures appear to shift and breathe.\n**Characters:** Figures on bridges subtly turn, gazing skyward.",
