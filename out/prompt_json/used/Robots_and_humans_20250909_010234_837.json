    "video_prompt": "The massive mechs emit subtle puffs of smoke from various vents, their metallic surfaces reflecting shifting light. Small groups of people on the elevated walkways walk and converse, with some individuals occasionally pausing to look at the mechs. Distant mechs in the hangar shimmer slightly due to atmospheric heat haze. Occasional faint sparks and small wisps of steam rise from the machinery on the platforms. Overhead, light subtly filters through the skylights, creating a slow, ethereal dance of shadows.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-angle, long shot of a futuristic robot factory or repair facility, rendered in a detailed, sci-fi style. The scene is dominated by massive, multi-story gantries and platforms. In the foreground and midground, a large, two-legged, orange and white bipedal mech is the central focus, standing on a wide elevated walkway alongside several smaller human figures. Smoke or steam emanates from industrial structures adjacent to the mech. Further down the long, tunnel-like facility, several other large mechs are visible in various stages of assembly or repair, receding into the hazy background.\n\nThe architecture is industrial with a heavy sci-fi influence, featuring metallic structures, exposed pipes, and complex machinery. The color palette is primarily cool grays and blues for the metalwork, contrasted with warmer oranges, yellows, and browns for parts of the mechs and specific equipment. The lighting is bright and atmospheric, with sunlight or powerful artificial lights streaming in from the open end of the facility, creating a sense of depth and a slightly hazy atmosphere, especially in the background. The overall mood is one of busy, advanced industry, with a human scale hinted at by the numerous small figures interacting with the vast machinery. The composition leads the eye from the foreground mech down the length of the impressive facility.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Massive mechs emit pulsating smoke and reflect shifting light. People on elevated walkways move, converse, and occasionally pause to turn their heads. Distant mechs shimmer with heat haze. Sparks and steam rise from platform machinery. Overhead, light subtly filters, creating a dancing play of shadows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Massive mechs lurch aggressively, steam jets blasting with unexpected force as they slam down. Elevated walkways buckle and sway, sending crowds scrambling. Distant mechs erupt in blinding flashes and crackling energy pulses. Overhead skylights shatter, raining down glass and blinding light! Machinery explodes, flinging sparks and shrapnel into the chaotic scene below.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Giant mechs pulse with ethereal light, dissolving into shimmering galaxies. Humans float upwards, morphing into flocks of glowing birds. Metallic surfaces ripple like water, reflecting impossible skies. Time splinters, creating endless, fractal echoes of movement where skylights bleed rainbows onto morphing floors. Gravity reverses in undulating waves, making everything dance in a symphony of impossible perpetual motion and cosmic transformation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Cinematic POV: A massive mech lumbers forward, steam billowing dramatically. Crane down to a civilian, startled, who glances up as the camera sweeps past, revealing the hangar's immense scale. The final shot is a triumphant, high-angle pan as the mech strides towards the light, its silhouette framed by the industrial architecture.",
