    "video_prompt": "Subtle pulsing glow from internal ship lights. Small, bright star-like particles drift across the screen. Faint, slow rotation of the gas giant on the left.

    "image_prompt": "**Key elements**: Spaceship fleet, futuristic design, space, planets, rings, data stream (circular), nebula, stars, light streaks, neon blue accents.\n\n**Art style**: Digital art, sci-fi concept art, realistic rendering with glowing elements.\n\n**Composition**:\n*   A large, detailed dark grey futuristic battleship with glowing blue accents dominates the mid-ground, slightly off-center, pointing towards the upper right. Its underside and side are visible.\n*   Another, smaller, similar battleship is behind and to the right of the main ship, further in the background.\n*   A fleet of smaller, white-ish spaceships with blue glowing thrusters and accents are visible in the lower left and lower right, flying in formation.\n*   A stylized ringed planet and a smaller moon are in the upper right, with a bright sun-like light source behind them.\n*   A large, curved planet is on the mid-left side.\n*   A glowing, circular data stream or energy ring, composed of light dots and abstract symbols, encircles the main battleship and the left planet, emanating a light blue glow.\n*   A subtle purple-pink nebula or cloud formation is in the lower half of the image.\n*   Scattered bright stars are throughout the dark space background.\n\n**Colors**: Predominantly dark blues, greys, and black for ships and space, contrasting with bright neon blue for ship lights and energy, warm gold/orange for stellar light and planets, and subtle purples/pinks for the nebula.\n\n**Lighting**: Dynamic and atmospheric. Strong light source from the upper right illuminating the planets and subtly reflecting off the ships. Intense blue glows from ship thrusters and accents. The data stream also emits a soft blue light, creating illuminated halos. Bright distant stars.\n\n**Atmosphere**: Epic, technologically advanced, awe-inspiring, and slightly mysterious. A sense of movement and grand scale.\n\n**Prompt**:\nA highly detailed futuristic battleship with an angular, dark grey hull and vibrant neon blue glowing accents and thrusters, flying through deep space. It is the dominant subject, slightly off-center and angled towards the upper right. Behind it, a smaller, similar battleship follows. In the lower half, a fleet of smaller, white and grey, sleek spaceships with blue glowing thrusters fly in formation. A massive, textured ringed planet and a smaller moon are illuminated by a brilliant light source in the upper right. On the mid-left, another large, curved planet is subtly visible. A luminous, circular data stream, composed of glowing light points and abstract symbols, encircles the main battleship and the left planet, emitting a soft blue aura. Sparse, bright stars are scattered across the dark, vast cosmic background, with subtle purple and pink nebulae forming ethereal clouds in the lower section. Digital sci-fi concept art, realistic rendering, dynamic lighting, high resolution.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle pulsing glow from internal ship lights. Small, bright star-like particles drift across the screen. Faint, slow rotation of the gas giant on the left. Data streams and luminous rings around the central ship subtly shimmer and shift. Distant nebula clouds gently undulate. Spaceship engine exhaust subtly flickers and flows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Suddenly, the central spaceship's core surges, emitting blinding pulses that violently contort the data streams into chaotic, exploding rings. Distant planets lurch wildly, their rings shattering into shimmering fragments. Smaller ships rocket erratically, their engines flaring with unpredictable bursts. Nebula clouds violently churn and warp, revealing unseen cosmic phenomena. The entire scene is consumed by a relentless, aggressive dance of light and motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Glows pulse as ships become liquid light, their exhaust unraveling into cosmic threads that stitch nebulae into impossible forms. The gas giant exhales luminous rings, reversing gravity and pulling stars into its core, while data streams writhe into sentient patterns, devouring their own information. A dreamlike ballet where reality constantly rewrites itself.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A colossal spaceship, its internal lights subtly pulsing, charges through ethereal data streams and luminous rings that shimmer around it. The camera slowly unfurls into a sweeping view, revealing other smaller ships escorting it, their engine exhausts subtly flickering. Distant nebulas gently undulate as the camera pushes forward to a dramatic close-up of the main ship's powerful engines. The gas giant on the left rotates subtly, hinting at a vast, alien universe.",
