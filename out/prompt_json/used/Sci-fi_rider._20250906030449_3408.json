  "video_prompt": "Futuristic vehicle races, kicking up dust. Determined female driver navigates, her weapon shifting slightly. Background blurs with speed, hinting at urban structures. Lighting transitions from warm glow to fading light. Vehicle lights pulsate, reflecting road markings.  The graphic \"c29\" flickers in and out of view.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Full-body, high-angle shot of a determined, red and gray armored sci-fi female character in a powerful, rugged metallic gray futuristic ATV with glowing blue headlights, driving on a grey asphalt road with an orange stripe. She has brown hair in a high ponytail, subtle freckles, and a faint scar. A large assault rifle is mounted on her back. Late afternoon warm, hazy glow in background. Motion blur with blurred urban/post-apocalyptic structures. Prominent \"c29\" graphic in bottom right.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A futuristic vehicle surges forward, dust plumes billowing behind. The determined driver's focused gaze tracks the road, her weapon subtly adjusting position. The background streaks past, urban outlines rapidly appearing and receding. Ambient lighting dynamically shifts from a warm cast to a diminishing twilight. Vehicle lights intensely pulsate, their beams sweeping over and reflecting off passing road markings. A \"c29\" graphic intermittently flickers into and out of visibility."
