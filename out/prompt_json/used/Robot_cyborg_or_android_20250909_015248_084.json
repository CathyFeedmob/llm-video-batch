    "video_prompt": "Subtle flickering of the red lights within the robot's head, very slight shimmering on the polished black and gold surfaces as if reflecting ambient light shifts. A gentle, almost imperceptible forward and backward sway of the upper torso, suggesting a very deep \"breath\" or power cycle. Minimal, slow camera zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed full-body shot of a sleek, futuristic humanoid robot, known as \"C29\", rendered with stunning photorealism. The robot features a predominantly black glossy metallic finish, accented with intricate gold and bronze mechanical components, particularly around the head, shoulders, and chest. Red glowing internal lights are visible through a transparent visor-like face, highlighting the robot's complex inner workings and giving it an intense, alert appearance. Thin, bright red illuminated lines also accentuate parts of its head and body.\n\nThe robot is captured from a slightly low angle, making it appear imposing, with its three-quarter profile facing right, and its gaze directed slightly upwards and to the right. The composition focuses primarily on the robot's upper torso and head, emphasizing the detailed craftsmanship and advanced technology. Various wires, hydraulic tubes, and intricate gears are visible, showcasing the internal mechanics.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic and controlled, with strong contrast. Bright, neutral-toned light sources in the background create subtle reflections on the robot's polished surface, enhancing its metallic sheen. The overall atmosphere is futuristic and slightly industrial, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the robot sharply in focus while blurring the background into soft, indistinct shapes. The background features vertical luminous elements, suggesting a technological or laboratory setting.\n\nThe image prominently features the text \"C29\" in the bottom right corner, with \"C\" in white and \"29\" in a vibrant orange, both in a clean, sans-serif font. The top left corner includes small, subtle white Chinese characters.\n\n**Art styles:** Photorealism, Sci-Fi, Robotic Art.\n**Camera:** DSLR, Wide-angle lens.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic lighting, Rim lighting, Contrasting light.\n**Colors:** Dominant black, metallic gold/bronze, glowing red, subtle white/grey.\n**Atmosphere:** Futuristic, High-tech, Industrial.\n**Composition:** Low angle shot, Three-quarter profile, Detailed focus on robot with blurred background.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle flickering within the robot's head, gentle shimmering across its surfaces. Its upper torso sways, almost imperceptibly, as the camera slowly zooms out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive shattering of the robot's head, revealing intense red energy surge. Its polished surfaces violently contort and buckle, gold components sparking and flaring. The robot's torso lunges forward with uncontrollable force, arms thrashing. Rapid, chaotic camera zoom-ins and whip pans accentuate the destructive transformation. Debris blasts outward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robot's polished surfaces ripple like water, reflecting impossible kaleidoscopic landscapes that aren't there. Its internal red lights pulse with a non-euclidean glow, twisting and reforming into abstract neural pathways that extend beyond its head. The entire robot slowly unravels into shimmering threads of light, which then reweave themselves into a nebula of swirling gold and black, before compressing back into its original form, only subtly altered.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The robotic head, featuring subtle flickering red lights, is showcased through a slow, dramatic circular pan, highlighting the shimmering black and gold surfaces under shifting ambient light. A gentle, almost imperceptible forward-to-backward sway of the upper torso, reminiscent of a deep breath or power cycle, is emphasized by a slow zoom onto the robotic body. The shot concludes with a minimal, slow camera zoom out, maintaining focus on the robot's imposing presence.",
