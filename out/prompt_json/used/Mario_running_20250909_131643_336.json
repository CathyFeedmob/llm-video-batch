    "video_prompt": "Mario's hat brim and overall straps gently sway. The multicolored particles and streaks behind him subtly pulse and flow along their paths, with individual particles twinkling and dissolving. Brightness subtly flickers across the scene. A very subtle slow zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant and dynamic digital illustration of Super Mario running excitedly through a rainbow-colored, particle-filled landscape. The background is a dark, almost black, gradient, allowing the bright colors to pop. Mario is depicted in his classic red cap with an \"M\" logo, blue overalls, and brown shoes, with a cheerful expression on his face.\n\nThe motion is emphasized by swirling trails of light and numerous small, colorful geometric shapes (squares, circles) and luminous specks that emanate from Mario, creating a sense of speed and energy. These trails of light are reminiscent of paint strokes or swirling ribbons of liquid light, transitioning smoothly through the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, magenta). The shapes appear to be exploding outwards, creating a confetti-like effect.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic, with bright, almost glowing highlights on Mario from the surrounding colorful light. There is a strong sense of depth due to the varying sizes and densities of the particles and light trails, some appearing closer and sharper, others receding into the background as soft bokeh.\n\nThe style is modern and lively, possibly leaning towards a 3D animation render with soft shading and crisp details on Mario, contrasted with the more abstract and glowing background elements. A subtle glow or aura surrounds Mario, further integrating him into the colorful environment. The composition places Mario in the mid-right, running diagonally upwards, creating a sense of forward motion and ascent. The bottom right features a stylized white text \"C29\". The overall atmosphere is joyful, energetic, and magical.",

Brightness subtly flickers. A very subtle slow zoom out reveals more of the surrounding environment.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Mario's hat brim violently snaps, overall straps whip wildly. The multicoloured particles explode outwards, swirling into chaotic, incandescent bursts that ripple with raw energy. Streaks behind him rip across the scene like cosmic lightning. Individual particles ignite, then violently dissipate. The brightness flashes intensely, strobing with an erratic, aggressive rhythm. The camera doesn't zoom—it lunges back, pulling away from the sheer force of the expanding light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Mario's hat brim and overall straps unravel into shimmering ribbons, drifting upwards. The exploding particles reverse, reforming into solid blocks that then stretch and warp into ethereal rainbows. The rainbow streaks pull Mario backward, his form subtly distorting into a painterly swirl of colors that then coalesce into coins before dissolving. The scene breathes, expanding and contracting like a beating heart, as gravity flickers.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A swift tracking shot arcs around Mario as he leaps, his hat brim and overall straps swaying with dynamic force. The vibrant, pulsating streaks behind him surge like a rainbow tide, individual particles exploding and regenerating. A rapid, subtle zoom out reveals the expansive, ethereal trail, its brightness flickering rhythmically. The camera then smoothly glides forward, trailing Mario as he bursts through the cosmic stream, emphasizing his powerful stride.",
