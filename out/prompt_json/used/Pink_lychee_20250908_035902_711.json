    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze rustles the palm leaves in the background. Subtle ripples appear on the ocean surface. The fork slightly glints as a soft light dances across its surface. Tiny, sparkling particles drift and shimmer above the pink plate, and some appear to move within the translucent lychee flesh. The lychee leaves subtly sway.",
    "image_prompt": "A close-up, eye-level shot captures a surreal, vibrant pink fruit resembling a lychee, with its textured outer skin artfully peeled back to reveal a translucent, shimmering pink interior. This inner part contains a golden-brown, gem-like core, suspended within the clear, smooth flesh. A silver fork is poised to pierce the fruit from the right, held by a hand.\n\nThe fruit rests on a glistening, ornate clear glass dish with a gold rim, which is placed on another, larger pink dish. The pink dish is reflective and sparkles with glitter-like highlights. The background is a soft-focus tropical scene: a bright blue ocean with white sandy beaches and the dark green silhouette of a palm tree on the left.\n\nThe lighting is bright and summery, casting subtle reflections and highlights on the metallic fork and the glass dishes, especially creating star-like flares on the fork, the fruit's interior, and the pink dish. Water droplets are visible on the green leaves of the fruit's stem. The overall aesthetic is whimsical and luxurious, with a dreamlike quality.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Swaying palm fronds. Rippling ocean surface. Fork reflects dancing light. Sparkling particles drift above the plate and within the lychee. Lychee leaves gently sway.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Palm leaveslash violently in a hurricane. The ocean erupts with tidal waves. The fork explodes with sun-like brilliance, shattering the air. Sparkling particles ignite, forming a fiery vortex over the plate, then aggressively burrow into the lychee, causing its flesh to pulse and writhe. The lychee leaves thrash and rip apart with unseen force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The lychee skin slowly unravels, its texture rippling like liquid silk. The translucent inner flesh, now iridescent, continuously bleeds colors backward through the spectrum. A single, shimmering particle within the lychee expands, engulfing the fruit, then shrinks to reveal a tiny, rotating galaxy. The ocean waves in the background fold inward upon themselves, becoming a mirror that reflects the palm leaves as golden, sentient fronds dancing in reverse before fading into nothingness. The fork levitates, transforming into a constellation of sparkling light, its prongs stretching and bending impossibly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically, subtly pans from the shimmering ocean and swaying palms, then rapidly push-in to the lychee. A glistening fork descends, slow-motion, puncturing the translucent flesh with a theatrical gleam. Sparkles swirl on the plate, intensifying as the camera encircles the fruit, highlighting the internal luminescence. A final, close-up shot reveals the delicate jiggle of the lychee's core.",
