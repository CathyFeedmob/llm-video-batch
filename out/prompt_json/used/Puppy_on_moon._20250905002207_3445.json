  "image_prompt": "Whimsical, colorful illustration of a fluffy white dog (Maltese/Bichon Frise) with fuchsia ears, happily sitting on a glowing rainbow crescent moon. The dog and moon are made of translucent, iridescent material, reflecting pink, blue, and silver. Silver hearts and stars adorn the moon. Soft light blue background with twinkling stars and bokeh. Two pink wavy ribbons float in the background. Bright, ethereal lighting with highlights and soft shadows. Magical, cute, dreamy style.",
