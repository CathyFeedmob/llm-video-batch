    "video_prompt": "A subtle shimmer emanates from the glowing moon and stars on the ceiling. The blue liquid on the upper bar surface gently ripples and glows. Tiny luminescent particles drift within the blue liquid, slowly converging and dispersing. The blue liquid flowing from the upper bar to the lower bar drips and pools, with subtle movements in the puddles on the floor reflecting the overhead glow.  Small orbs suspended from the ceiling lamps gently sway. The cocktail glasses and mugs on the upper bar subtly reflect the ambient light, casting faint, shifting highlights. The light sources from behind the bar subtly pulsate.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical and fantastical bar, bathed in a celestial glow. The centerpiece is a large, crescent moon-shaped bar counter, glowing with luminescent blue liquid that appears to drip down into a rounded bar island below. The liquid on the bar surface and dripping from it resembles a starry night sky or a nebula, with faint circular patterns on the floor around the bar stools. Hanging above, from the starry ceiling which mimics a celestial expanse, are ornate, golden-hued pendant lights, some appearing to be small planets or celestial bodies.\n\nThe ceiling itself is a deep indigo blue, speckled with stars and wispy clouds, with a prominent glowing crescent moon at its center. The bar area is furnished with sleek, dark blue bar stools with metallic gold bases.\n\nIn the background, to the left, there's a well-stocked bar shelf with various bottles and a large, ornate mirror. To the right, a grand piano stands next to more shelves filled with glassware and glowing elements. The overall lighting is dim and atmospheric, with warm orange and yellow accents from the shelves and wall decor contrasting with the cool blue luminescence of the bar and ceiling. The style is otherworldly and imaginative, resembling a dreamlike space bar with elements of art nouveau and fantasy. The composition is focused on the central bar, with a wide-angle view capturing the intricate details of the room.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Ceiling light shimmers emanate, pulsating behind the bar. Blue liquid ripples, glowing particles drift, converging and dispersing. Liquid drips and pools, reflecting overhead glow with subtle movements. Suspended orbs gently sway. Glass reflections subtly shift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive moonlight pulsates, forcing the ceiling stars to erupt in bursts of light. The blue liquid on the upper bar surface violently churns, sending luminescent particles skyward in a chaotic vortex. A torrent of glowing blue liquid dramatically surges from the upper bar, splashing and swirling into violent puddles on the floor that violently ripple and expand. Orbs suspended from the ceiling lamps wildly swing, crashing into each other. Cocktails on the upper bar shatter, their contents exploding outwards. The light sources behind the bar aggressively flicker and explode.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Reality unravels as glowing stars invert, plunging into swirling celestial puddles below. The blue liquid on the upper bar surface defies gravity, streams upwards, and crystallizes into shimmering, impossible moon dust. On the lower bar, cocktails morph into sentient, miniature galaxies, their nebulae pulsating with impossible colors and whispering ancient secrets. Luminescent floor puddles ripple into portals, swallowing and spitting out reflections that are not our own. Overhead lamps expand into cosmic entities, their orbs warping space and time with each impossible sway. Gaze upon a world reborn in liquid starlight, where the laws of physics are but a nostalgic memory.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera glides upward, revealing the moonlit ceiling, a shimmer of stars appearing and vanishing. It sweeps down, tracing the luminous blue liquid as it cascades, pulsating with ethereal glow. A dramatic zoom-in reveals luminescent particles swirling within the liquid, converging then exploding outwards. The camera follows a drip, slowly falling, then splashes into a glowing puddle on the floor. A final, slow pan captures glowing orbs gracefully swaying, casting shifting highlights across the bar's liquid surface.",
