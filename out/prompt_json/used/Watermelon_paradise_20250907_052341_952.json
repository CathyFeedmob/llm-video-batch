    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze causes small green leaves to subtly sway. The waterfall flows continuously, with individual water droplets subtly falling from the high edges of the watermelon. A single watermelon seed floats down in the waterfall. The water in the pool gently ripples. The small figure slightly shifts her weight, her clothes subtly moving. The light source outside brightens and dims slightly, casting subtle shifts in highlights and shadows on the watermelon's interior.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the image of the watermelon microcosm:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A surreal, whimsical, and highly detailed miniature world meticulously carved inside a cross-section of a fresh, ripe watermelon. The watermelon's vibrant red flesh forms the landscape, complete with textured pores and shiny black seeds resembling stones and pathways.\n\n**Composition & Elements:**\nA cascading waterfall of clear, glistening water originates from a large bite-mark at the top center of the watermelon, flowing down into a serene, turquoise-blue pool at the bottom. Tiny, lush green trees and shrubs are strategically placed, growing directly from the red flesh, resembling miniature forests and shrubbery around the pool and along the curved inner walls. Water droplets cling and drip from the top inner rind and the waterfall's path. Scattered black watermelon seeds act as natural stepping stones and decorative elements on the red surface. On the immediate right of the pool, a small, square block of watermelon flesh serves as a pedestal. A miniature human figure, appearing as an adult woman with her back to the viewer, stands on this block, facing and holding a small slice of watermelon, gazing at the tranquil pool and waterfall. Sunlight streams in from the top right, originating from the large bite-mark opening, illuminating the scene. Hints of green foliage (palm leaves) from the outside world are visible through this opening.\n\n**Style & Atmosphere:**\nSurreal, whimsical, dreamlike, miniature world photography. The style should be photorealistic with a slight hyperreal or artistic touch, emphasizing texture and detail. The atmosphere is peaceful, refreshing, and enchanting.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant vibrant red and deep green, with contrasting bright turquoise blue for the water. Accents of stark black for seeds, and brilliant white/light blue for the waterfall. Bright, natural sunlight from the top right, creating soft highlights and gentle shadows.\n\n**Lighting:**\nBright, natural, and soft key lighting from the top right opening. The light highlights the water's movement and the glistening surfaces of the watermelon flesh and seeds. Subtle shadows define the contours of the landscape and the small trees.\n\n**Camera & Perspective:**\nEye-level, slightly wide-angle perspective, capturing the depth and intricate details of the miniature world within the watermelon. The watermelon's green rind and white pith are visible around the rim, framing the scene. The scene is within a visible watermelon at the bottom left and top right, showcasing its exterior texture and color variations.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Small green leaves subtly sway. Water continuously flows, droplets falling. A single seed floats downwards. Water gently ripples. A small figure imperceptibly shifts, clothes subtly moving. Light brightens and dims, shifting highlights and shadows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A colossal watermelon section EXPLODES inwards! The waterfall roars, a torrent of water GUSHING upwards, flinging watermelon seeds like bullets. Trees UPROOT and WHIP violently, their leaves becoming a vortex. The pool THRASHES, its waters EJECTING violently as the miniature figure LEAPS, her clothes RIPPING in the gale, holding her watermelon slice like a shield against the SUDDEN, blinding FLASHES of light and SHIFTING shadows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "From the bitten edge of the watermelon, jagged shards of light reverse into green vines. Gravity pulls the water upwards, forming a twisting, impossibly tall column that drains the pool. Watermelon seeds, now bioluminescent eyes, float upward through the water column, watching the tiny figure, whose reflection in the rising water stretches and distorts into a kaleidoscope of impossible colors. The trees begin to unravel, their leaves becoming tiny black seeds floating like constellations within the fruit.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, unsettling zoom past swaying green leaves reveals a towering waterfall. As a lone seed plummets into the churning pool, the water erupts, sending tremors through the watermelon's core. The figure, startled, stumbles forward, her watermelon slice barely catching her balance. External light pulses erratically, casting monstrous shadows that dance menacingly across the vibrant interior.",
