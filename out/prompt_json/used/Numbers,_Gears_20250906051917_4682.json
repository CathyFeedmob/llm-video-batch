  "video_prompt": "Metallic numerals and letter \"C\" with circuit patterns glow and pulsate. Intermeshed gears rotate. Circuit lines energize and flow, forming dynamic outlines. Background grid and glowing lines subtly shift, evoking data flow. A stylized logo appears and dissolves.",
  "image_prompt": "High-tech digital graphic: Metallic \"C2\" with glowing orange circuit patterns and embedded screws, atop a combined \"29\" element. The \"9\" also features orange circuits. Intermeshed golden and silver gears positioned between elements. Blue circuit lines extend from the \"9\". Dark blue-black background with glowing blue and orange circuit lines, grid pattern, and abstract shapes, including a padlock outline. Stylized \"c29\" logo in bottom right. Emphasizes advanced technology, data, and mechanical precision with glowing circuit aesthetics.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Numerals and 'C' symbols glow and rhythmically pulsate, their circuit patterns illuminating and dimming. Intermeshed gears continuously rotate. Circuit lines energize, flowing to form dynamic outlines. A background grid and glowing lines subtly shift, evoking data flow. A stylized logo emerges and then dissolves."
