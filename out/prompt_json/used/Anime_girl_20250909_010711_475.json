    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze subtly sways her long hair and the fringe of her tattered poncho. Her chest subtly rises and falls with soft breaths. Faint dust motes drift in the air around her. Her eyes slowly blink. The dangling ribbons on her hair ties flutter lightly. Her arm holding the sword shifts almost imperceptibly with the weight.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of an anime-style character, a young woman with long, flowing auburn hair and a confident, serene expression. Her blue eyes gaze forward. She is wearing a dark, layered, torn and ragged dress or tunic with high slits, revealing her thighs. Over this, she has a large, light brown, distressed and fringed shawl or cape draped across her shoulders and around her arms, suggesting an ancient or worn fabric. She is wearing dark, fingerless gloves or arm wraps. On her feet are traditional Japanese geta sandals with thick wooden soles and brown straps, with her ankles wrapped in cloth. She holds a sheathed katana sword in her left hand, partially visible. Her hair is tied with small, colorful ribbons near the crown of her head. She wears a silver choker and a delicate silver necklace with a small charm.\n\n**Composition:**\nSymmetrical, full-body shot. The character stands centrally, looking directly at the viewer. Strong vertical lines from her body and sword.\n\n**Style:**\nAnime, digital illustration, with a slightly painterly touch and visible brushstrokes, especially in the background and clothing textures. The character design is clean with soft shading on the skin, contrasting with the rougher textures of her attire.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant warm earthy tones: rich auburn for hair, various shades of light and dark browns and muted greys for clothing. Blue eyes provide a subtle pop of color. The background is very light, desaturated grey-beige, with faint shapes and patterns suggesting ancient motifs or spirits, illuminated by a soft, diffused light.\n\n**Lighting:**\nSoft, diffused, and even lighting from an overhead or slightly front source, highlighting the character without harsh shadows. A subtle glow around the character and in the background.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nMysterious, stoic, serene, and slightly enigmatic. A sense of journey or ancient world.\n\n**Additional details for hyper-realistic engines (optional but helpful):**\n- Intricate details on her geta sandals, including slight wear on the wood.\n- Subtle texture on the rough fabric of her shawl, showing individual threads and fringes.\n- Reflective quality on the metal of her choker and necklace.\n- The faint, ethereal shapes in the blurred background.\n- \"C29\" watermark visible in the bottom right corner (if desired to replicate exactly).\n- \"AI生成\" text in the top left corner (if desired to replicate exactly).\n\n---\n**Shorter Version for Concise Prompts:**\n\nAnime full body of a stoic young woman with long auburn hair, blue eyes. She wears a ragged dark dress, a fringed light brown shawl, and wooden geta sandals. She holds a sheathed katana. Soft, diffused lighting against a light grey, ethereal background with mystical patterns. Digital painting style, earthy tones.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Her long hair and poncho fringe softly sway with a gentle breeze. Her chest subtly rises and falls with breathing. Tiny dust motes drift. Her eyes slowly blink. Ribbons on her hair ties flutter lightly. Her sword-bearing arm shifts imperceptibly from weight.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her hair whips violently in a sudden, unseen tempest, ribbons lashing like serpents. The tattered poncho rips from her, fragments scattering like shrapnel. Her chest heaves, muscles straining as she lunges, sword a blinding arc of deadly steel. Dust explodes from the ground in a furious cloud, her eyes snapping open, blazing with primal intensity. The very air around her crackles with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her hair unnaturally ripples, defying gravity as ribbons untie then re-tie themselves. The tattered poncho warps into woven light, then unravels into individual threads that dance and re-knit. Her breaths pull ambient dust motes inward, compressing them into shimmering gems that blink open as her eyes do, before dissolving into swirling nebulae. The sword, impossibly light, floats from her hand, splitting into ghostly echoes that orbit her.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, wide shot reveals the wind whipping her hair and poncho before a dramatic close-up of her eyes. The camera follows a gust of wind, panning down to her shifting arms as dust motes swirl around the sword. A sudden, subtle glint reflects off the blade. A reverse zoom-out reveals her full figure, still and powerful.",
