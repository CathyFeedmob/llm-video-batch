    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmering and swirling within the blue and purple gradient liquid, creating gentle ebbs and flows. The clear outer shell of the object gains a very soft, almost imperceptible pulsation, reflecting delicate highlights that subtly shift. Light refraction through the clear material causes a faint dancing of light rays on the white plate. The tiny berries inside the liquid very slowly bob and rotate. The reflection on the plate subtly changes its color intensity and pattern as if responding to the inner movement.",
    "image_prompt": "A visually striking image featuring a clear spiral-shaped glass or acrylic object, resembling a futuristic dessert or artistic sculpture, placed on a white ceramic plate. Inside the spiral, there's a dynamic gradient of textured liquid, transitioning from a vibrant blue on the left to a rich purple on the right, punctuated by several dark, glossy spheres that look like berries or pearls.\n\nThe object is well-lit, with prominent reflections and highlights across its transparent surface, emphasizing its smooth, curved lines and the layered texture of its exterior. The lighting creates a strong sense of depth and a captivating interplay of light and shadow on the white surface below, where the colors inside the spiral are reflected, creating an ethereal glow of blues and purples.\n\nThe composition is centered, with the spiral object slightly angled to the right, drawing the viewer's eye. The white plate provides a clean and minimalist backdrop, allowing the vibrant colors and intricate details of the object to stand out. The atmosphere is clean, modern, and artistic, with a hint of sci-fi or conceptual design. A subtle \"c29\" watermark is visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Liquid within the object subtly swirls and shimmers, gently ebbing and flowing. The outer shell imperceptibly pulsates, shifting delicate highlights. Light rays dance faintly on the white plate due to refraction. Berries inside the liquid very slowly bob and rotate. The reflection on the plate subtly changes in color intensity and pattern.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive surge erupts within the transparent coil! The blue-purple liquid violently churns, black spheres wildly ricocheting and shattering against the intensifying, laser-like light beams. The acrylic shell abruptly contorts, distorting the reflections into chaotic, flashing streaks. The entire structure grinds and pulses, emitting resonant blasts as if under immense internal pressure. The serene reflection on the plate becomes a maelstrom of jagged, electrified light, mirroring the object's violent upheaval.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The clear shell pulses with an outer layer of liquid filaments, each strand stretching outwards then snapping back into place, defying cohesion. The internal blue-purple liquid, instead of flowing, solidifies into impossibly tangled crystalline structures that morph into a flock of shimmering butterflies before dissolving into shimmering dust. The berries detach and orbit erratically outside the form, casting inverted shadows onto the plate, which periodically breathes and exhales faint, glowing mist.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A silent, slow zoom-in on the mesmerizing liquid within the transparent shell. The camera then smoothly glides, revealing individual berries slowly tumbling. As cinematic light sweeps across, highlights shimmer along the shell, casting a gentle, ethereal glow on the plate below, where refracted light gracefully dances.",
