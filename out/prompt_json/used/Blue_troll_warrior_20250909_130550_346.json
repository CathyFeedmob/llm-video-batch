    "video_prompt": "Subtle chest rise and fall, gentle sway of the red mohawk and fur/fabric clothing from a breeze, slight glint on the weapons, and a slow, almost imperceptible camera zoom or drift.",
    "image_prompt": "Full-body shot of a powerfully built blue-skinned humanoid with a striking red mohawk in an outdoor, sunset setting. The character, resembling a troll or orc, has prominent tusks, yellow eyes, and pointed ears adorned with piercings. He wears tribal attire consisting of fur, leather straps, and bone ornaments, including a large skull-like buckle on his waist.\n\nHe is equipped with a quiver of detailed, sharp-tipped spears on his back and holds two primitive-looking axes, one with a blood-stained blade, in his hands. His strong, muscular physique is visible, with subtle patterns on his skin. A long, slender tail extends behind him.\n\nThe scene is set in a vast, golden-hued field of tall grass, stretching towards rolling hills and dense forests in the distance. The sky above is a soft blend of light blue and pale orange, indicating either dawn or dusk. The lighting is natural and atmospheric, casting a warm glow on the character and the landscape. The overall tone is heroic and adventurous, with a hint of ferocity from the character's expression and weaponry. The image has a detailed, realistic, and somewhat painterly quality, reminiscent of high-fantasy concept art.\n\n**Aspect ratio:** 9:16",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few refined options, focusing purely on dynamic elements:\n\n**Option 1 (Concise):**\nBreath-like chest undulation, red mohawk and fur/fabric subtly rippling in a breeze. Weapons catch fleeting glints of light. A near-imperceptible camera glide slowly closes in.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly more evocative):**\nA rhythmic, shallow rise and fall of the chest. The red mohawk and textured clothing dance softly with an unseen current. Gleaming weapons subtly shift their reflection. A ghost of a dolly in or zoom.\n\n**Option 3 (Focus on organic movement):**\nSoft, expanding and contracting chest motions. The red mohawk and fibrous garment material gently ripple and flutter. Weapons exhibit shifting, ephemeral glints. A very gradual, almost imperceptible camera push.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A violent earthquake rips through the ground, sending the troll stumbling! The red mohawk whips wildly as gale-force winds tear at his fur garments. His weapons ignite with arcane energy, pulsing ferociously. The landscape erupts around him: trees bend to breaking, rocks levitate chaotically, and the sky cracks with phantom lightning. The camera lurches and spins, barely keeping pace with the chaos.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The troll's body phases into shimmering water, flowing upward as its head melts into a fiery nebula, constantly reshaping. The mohawk strands detach, spiraling into a vortex, pulling the landscape into an ethereal, upside-down reflection. Weapons hover, shedding light that warps the sky into geometric patterns.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Opening with a slow camera push-in on the character's stern face, subtly revealing the glint of his eyes. A gentle breeze causes his red mohawk and fur clothing to sway as the camera smoothly arcs left, showcasing the formidable axe blade and then circling to reveal the quiver of spears. The camera then descends, tracking the character's slight foot shift, emphasizing his imposing stance within the windswept field.",
