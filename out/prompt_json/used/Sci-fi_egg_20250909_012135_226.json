    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA highly detailed, sci-fi mechanical egg-shaped object, standing vertically on a minimalist white or light gray surface. The object is predominantly black with intricate gold and bright red accents. A significant portion of its front is revealed, showcasing complex internal machinery with glowing red lights and exposed wires/tubes, suggesting a powerful core. Several circular, glowing orange/red lights are symmetrically placed on the black exterior. The design is sleek, futuristic, and robust, with clear mechanical details like vents, bolts, and panel lines.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Object:** Egg-shaped, symmetrical, robust, mechanical, futuristic.\n*   **Color Palette:** Dominant black, rich metallic gold, striking bright red, luminous orange/red for lights.\n*   **Surface Details:** Smooth, polished black shell contrasted with textured gold panels (some with vents/grates), red stripes, exposed internal mechanisms.\n*   **Internal Details:** Intricate machinery, wires, tubes, gears, and structural supports, all illuminated with a strong red glow emanating from within.\n*   **External Features:** Multiple circular lights with orange-red halos, some recessed sections, and subtle markings/text like \"C29\" (optional: \"R&D\" or similar futuristic labels if allowed by generator).\n*   **Lighting:** Dramatic and focused. Internal core creates a strong red/orange ambient glow that spills onto the external components. External lights also emit a soft glow. Overall, a clean, studio-like fill light highlighting textures and reflections.\n*   **Reflections:** Noticeable, subtle reflections on the glossy black and metallic surfaces, indicating a polished finish.\n*   **Texture:** Mix of smooth, glossy surfaces (black), brushed metal (gold), and fine mechanical detailing for internal components.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Sci-Fi / Futuristic:** High-tech, advanced machinery.\n*   **Industrial Design:** Precision engineered aesthetic.\n*   **High-Detail Photorealism:** Sharp focus, crisp rendering of materials and intricate parts.\n*   **Studio Shot:** Clean background, isolated object.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Symmetrical:** Object centered and vertically aligned.\n*   **Eye-level View:** Straight-on, slightly below the object's center, emphasizing its form and base.\n*   **Full Body Shot:** The entire object is visible within the frame, with some negative space above and to the sides.\n*   **Balanced:** Weight is distributed evenly.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Technological, cutting-edge, imposing.**\n*   **Slightly mysterious due to the glowing core.**\n*   **Clean and sterile, like a high-tech laboratory or exhibition.**\n\n**Additional Notes for Generator:**\n*   Avoid adding hands, human figures, or unnecessary background elements.\n*   Maintain a sharp focus across the entire object.\n*   Ensure the glowing elements look natural and emit light realistically.\n*   The \"C29\" text is a key identifier.\n*   The Chinese characters \"AI生成\" in the top left corner should be re-rendered as image generation watermarks if the platform uses them.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Orange lights subtly fluctuate in glow. Red core gently pulses. Camera slightly drifts and rotates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Rapid, violent oscillation of the orange lights, strobing intensely. The red core pulsates erratically, then violently ruptures, emitting chaotic energy tendrils. The entire pod shudders, twists, and abruptly levitates, rotating wildly while panels violently detach and reattach, sparks showering everywhere. A sudden, jarring camera zoom and whip pan reveal a hidden, pulsating appendage bursting from the pod's side.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The glowing orange lights melt, dripping like liquid fire onto the floor, which then flows upward, coating the object in luminous amber. The red core subtly inverts, pulling darkness inward until it radiates pure light, distorting the surrounding space into a shimmering vortex. The device itself slowly unzips mid-air, revealing infinite layers within, each a different impossible color.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera sweeps in, dramatically revealing the sleek, black egg-shaped device, its golden accents gleaming. A subtle, rhythmic pulse emanates from the orange lights, mirroring the gentle throb of the internal red core. The camera then executes a tight, almost suffocating zoom, focusing on exposed mechanisms, before a slow, contemplative rotation reveals the \"C29\" designation. The ambient light subtly shifts, intensifying the dramatic glow as the camera drifts slightly, hinting at a presence unseen.",
