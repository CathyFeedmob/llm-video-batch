    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Style & Medium:** Digital painting, intricate illustration, ethereal, soft brushwork, slightly melancholic, fantasy art, gothic romance influence.\n\n**Subject & Composition:** Full-body portrait of a graceful, slender young woman, appearing like a spirit or ethereal bride. She looks upward with a serene, slightly wistful expression, her head tilted back. Her right hand delicately touches strands of a spiderweb extending from above, while her left hand is gently extended to the side, appearing to observe or interact with something unseen near her. The composition is vertical, with the woman centrally placed.\n\n**Character Details:**\n*   **Hair:** Long, wavy, light ash-blonde or very light brown hair, flowing over her shoulders, with delicate white floral and leafy circlet/ornamentation.\n*   **Dress:** Elaborate, floor-length gown with a full, flowing skirt. The dress is off-the-shoulder with ruffled sleeves, and entirely covered in shimmering, reflective paillettes or sequins resembling fragmented mirrors or sparkling frost, primarily in iridescent silver and white tones, catching ambient light. The fabric appears sheer and voluminous with layered ruffles.\n*   **Features:** Pale skin, delicate features, slightly parted lips, long neck.\n\n**Setting & Environment:**\n*   **Background:** Dark, shadowy, and aged interior space, possibly a grand, abandoned hall or crypt. Elements of crumbling architecture, high ceilings, and possibly a large, dark doorway or archway are visible. Hazy, muted green and grey tones dominate the background, suggesting dampness or overgrown elements.\n*   **Foreground/Lower Left:** A lush arrangement of white and pale pink roses, peonies, and other delicate white flowers with green foliage, positioned at the base of the woman's dress, as if growing around her or placed there.\n*   **Details:** Prominent, delicate white spiderwebs are strung across the top of the frame and around the woman's head and hands, with fine, almost invisible threads. A small black spider with red markings is subtly visible near the lower left floral arrangement, on a web or stem. Faint glints of light catch on the spiderwebs.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by cool tones: stark whites, iridescent silvers, various shades of muted grey, dark forest green, and soft, almost faded pinks for the flowers. Accents of deep shadow and subtle hints of warm glow on metallic elements.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, ethereal, and diffused light appears to emanate gently from above or an unseen source, highlighting the woman and the floral arrangement. The light makes the sequins on her dress sparkle intensely. The background is much darker, creating a strong contrast and depth.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Enchanting, mysterious, slightly eerie, dreamlike, melancholic beauty, timeless.\n\n**Artistic Intent/Mood:** To convey a sense of a graceful spirit or a ghost-like figure, intertwining beauty with themes of decay and nature reclaiming artificial spaces, evoking a sense of ancient forgotten elegance.\n\n**(Optional: Add \"AI-generated\" or \"AI-art\" if it's meant to be explicitly declared as such in the prompt itself, as seen in the top left corner of the original image.)**",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Focus on Dynamic Elements Only (Movement & Change):**\n\nThe dress fabric gently sways, glitter subtly shimmers on the gown, spiderwebs slowly move as a spider crawls along. Petals delicately rustle on the white flowers. Light softly glimmers, reflecting off the dress. The camera slowly zooms in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent tearing of the dress fabric, shattering glitter exploding from the gown, spiderwebs snap and whip, a spider leaps erratically, petals explode in a chaotic flurry, blinding flashes of light erupt from the dress, immediate, violent camera push-in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The dress shimmers, its glitter transforming into swirling galaxies as petals ascend into sentient hummingbirds. Spiderwebs, now silken bridges, transport the spider into a luminous cocoon. Fabric billows like frozen clouds, defying gravity, while light reverses, drawing the scene into an ethereal dreamscape where flowers pulse with cosmic energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A ghostly figure, the beautiful subject, stands frozen as the camera slowly pulls back, revealing her shimmering dress and the intricate spiderwebs surrounding her. A lone spider, illuminated by moonlight, descends gracefully onto the gown, its delicate legs tracing a path of ethereal movement. The soft glow intensifies, casting dramatic shadows as the wind picks up, making the petals of the white flowers dance and shimmer, drawing the eye towards the figure as if she's about to awaken.",
