  "video_prompt": "A stylish anime character, a young man, stands as wisps of smoke gracefully curl from his flickering cigarette ember. The background dynamically forms and dissolves with bold, black calligraphic brushstrokes, sweeping and swirling like ink. A pervasive, shifting glitch effect distorts the entire scene: vibrant red and cyan channels continuously split, shift, and create horizontal lines and blocky artifacts, ebbing and flowing in intensity around the character and background elements. His initially downcast eyes slowly lift, revealing a subtle change in expression.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n**Stylish anime male character in a cool pose, looking down, shadowed by a black wide-brim fedora. He wears a black leather trench coat with sharp lapels and shoulder straps, a white unbuttoned shirt, black bow tie, dark tailored pants with a silver chain, and a black glove holding a lit cigarette with wisps of smoke. Dark spiky hair, striking blue-green eyes, small hoop earrings, a sword hilt visible. Stark white background with bold black calligraphic brushstrokes and ink splatters, forming sweeping arcs that frame the character. Pervasive glitch effect and chromatic aberration with vibrant red and cyan digital distortion, horizontal lines, and blocky artifacts. Monochromatic palette with red and cyan accents, blue-green eyes, and glowing orange ember. Mysterious, film noir, cyberpunk aesthetic.**",
