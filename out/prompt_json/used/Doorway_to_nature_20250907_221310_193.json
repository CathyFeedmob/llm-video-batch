    "video_prompt": "Subtle twinkling of stars in the night sky. The soft sway of grass and flowers in the foreground as if a gentle breeze passes. Slight shimmering sunlight through the cherry blossoms in the distance. The subtle movement of the birds flying in the distance. The gentle rise and fall of the ocean in the background.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Core Concept:** A fantastical scene where a rustic, ornate wooden door opens from a starry night sky onto a vibrant, sunlit spring day by the sea.\n\n**Visual Elements & Composition:**\nA full-body vertical shot. The top two-thirds of the image depict a deep blue night sky filled with countless, bright, twinkling stars forming the Milky Way galaxy, stretching diagonally from top-left to bottom-right. The bottom third transitions to a dramatic sunset over a calm ocean, with a distant horizon line.\nCentered in the lower half of the frame, a vintage, intricately carved dark wooden door frame stands upright, with its right door ajar, opening outwards towards the viewer (a small portion of the door's side is visible). The door is open onto a picturesque spring landscape:\n*   A winding stone-cobbled path emerges from the door, leading into the distance, slightly curving to the left.\n*   Lush green grass covers gentle rolling hills on both sides of the path, dotted with abundant small, white, and pink wildflowers (like daisies).\n*   Several cherry blossom trees with visible pink flowers are scattered on the hillsides within the door frame.\n*   A brilliant golden sun is low in the sky within the door frame, casting strong, warm light and sun rays towards the viewer, creating lens flares.\n*   Several black silhouettes of birds (swallows/martins) are in mid-flight against the bright blue sky inside the door.\n*   Outside the door, in the foreground and near the door frame, there's a field of tall green grass and scattered pale pink and white wildflowers.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Night Sky:** Deep indigo and dark blues for the background, with bright whites, glowing blues, and hints of lavender and warm browns for the stars and Milky Way dust clouds.\n*   **Sunset (Outside door):** Warm gradients of orange, peach, and soft reds blend into a darkening horizon of deep blue-grey for the ocean.\n*   **Inside Door (Spring scene):** Vibrant greens for grass, soft baby pinks for cherry blossoms, clear bright blue for the sky. Golden yellow and orange for the sun, with a strong, clean white sunburst.\n*   **Door:** Rich, dark, polished brown wood.\n*   **Flowers:** Predominantly pure white and subtle pink.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Night Sky:** Ethereal, shimmering, and deep, with glowing starlight.\n*   **Inside Door:** Bright, radiant, and warm, with strong directional sunlight creating highlights and shadows, conveying a fresh, idyllic spring day.\n*   **Overall:** A sense of magical realism, wonder, and a portal to another world. Juxtaposition of cosmic grandeur and earthly beauty.\n\n**Style:**\nPhotorealistic with a touch of fantasy art. Highly detailed textures (wood grain, grass blades, star clusters). Soft-focus bokeh in the very foreground and background elements to emphasize the door as the focal point.\n\n**Artistic Considerations:**\n*   Clean composition, leading lines from the path.\n*   High dynamic range to capture both bright and dark elements.\n*   Subtle chromatic aberration around bright stars and sunburst.\n\n**Prompt Snippets (can be combined):**\n*   \"Ornate dark wooden door frame portal opening\"\n*   \"Into vibrant spring landscape, cherry blossom trees, winding stone path\"\n*   \"Bright golden sun rays, lens flare, flying swallows\"\n*   \"Outdoor scene, foreground tall grass, white and pink wildflowers\"\n*   \"Background of vast interstellar starry night sky, Milky Way galaxy visible\"\n*   \"Dramatic sunset over ocean outside the door\"\n*   \"Photorealistic, fantasy art, magical realism, high detail, rich colors\"\n*   \"Vertical orientation, full-body shot\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movement, Changes, Human Expression, Background Alterations:**\n\n*   **Stars:** Twinkling, appearing and disappearing\n*   **Grass/Flowers:** Gentle, continuous sway, bending and recovering\n*   **Cherry Blossoms:** Gentle shimmering, light dappling and shifting\n*   **Birds:** Distant, fluid flight paths, changing formations\n*   **Ocean:** Rhythmic rise and fall, subtle waves breaking",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent supernova erupts, stars exploding across the sky! Grass and flowers riotously thrash in a hurricane, ripped from the ground! Cherry blossoms violently ignite, incinerating the trees! Birds catapult through the air, transforming into fiery meteors, crashing into the turbulent, mountainous ocean which then surges upwards, defying gravity!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity-defying cherry blossoms blossom in reverse, their petals morphing into swirling constellations that rain down on the ocean, where waves ripple upwards and invert into a liquid sky. Birds fly backwards, dissolving into bursts of starlight. The wooden door frame breathes, its ornate carvings melting and reforming into cosmic dust, while daisies in the foreground unfurl and fold in impossible geometric patterns, their colors bleeding into the twilight.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping crane shot reveals a cosmic tapestry, stars subtly twinkling. The camera descends, transitioning to an ornate doorway framing a sun-drenched spring landscape. A gentle breeze sways foreground grass, revealing a stone path. Sun flares through cherry blossoms as birds gracefully traverse the sky. The camera glides through the door, revealing the moonlit ocean, its gentle rhythm mirroring the serene transition between worlds.",
