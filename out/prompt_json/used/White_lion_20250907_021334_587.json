    "video_prompt": "The majestic white lion gently breathes, its golden mane subtly rippling and glimmering with soft light. Tiny golden motes float through the air, dissipating and reforming around the lion and the clouds below. The large crescent moon in the background pulses with a faint, warm glow. The lion's eyes occasionally blink, and its tail swishes ever so slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "A majestic, ethereal white lion stands proudly on a vibrant, rainbow-colored rock formation, amidst a sea of glowing, soft white clouds.

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The white lion's golden mane lashes wildly as it roars, its eyes blazing with intense light. Golden motes erupt into swirling vortexes, violently whisking the surrounding clouds into a thunderous storm. The crescent moon flashes erratically, its light pulsing with explosive energy. The lion's tail whips, cracking like a lightning bolt, as its body shifts into a blur of raw power, sending shockwaves through the air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The majestic white lion shimmers, its golden mane unraveling into ethereal smoke that reforms into constellations. Golden motes ascend, becoming tiny moons orbiting a giant, pulsating crescent moon that stretches and folds like fabric. Clouds ripple upwards, transforming into iridescent rivers that defy gravity, flowing into the starry night as the lion's tail gently detaches, spiraling into a cosmic ouroboros.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide shot reveals the majestic white lion atop a cloud-shrouded peak, the moon a luminous arc behind. A slow push-in culminates in an extreme close-up of its eyes, which slowly open, revealing golden irises that briefly flare. As the camera pulls back, the lion gently exhales golden motes that rise and gracefully drift past the moon, which subtly pulses as if mirroring its breath. The tail then slowly swishes, stirring the mist and enhancing the golden glow around its base.",
