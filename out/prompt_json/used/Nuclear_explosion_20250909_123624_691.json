    "video_prompt": "An immense nuclear explosion with a towering mushroom cloud dominates the cityscape, destroying everything in its path. Subtle smoke tendrils rise from the explosion and dissipate into the air. Debris and dust from the ruined buildings fall onto the streets. The water by the city’s coast, now desolate, ripples gently as a result of the wind. A cool breeze causes the clouds in the sky to shift, revealing patches of blue sky. The camera slowly pans to the right, showing more of the destroyed city and the sea. Birds flutter in the sky above the destroyed city. The words \"c29\" are prominently displayed in the bottom right corner of the shot.",
    "image_prompt": "An aerial view depicting a devastating nuclear explosion over a coastal city, characterized by a massive mushroom cloud rising above a fiery blast zone. The city below is in ruins, with damaged buildings and debris scattered across the landscape extending to the harbor where ships are submerged. The sky is a mix of turbulent clouds and clear patches, illuminated by the intense orange and yellow glow from the explosion. The overall atmosphere is chaotic and destructive, with strong contrasts between light and shadow. In the bottom right corner, a weathered white \"C29\" is overlaid on the image.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Mushroom cloud expands and dissipates over disintegrating buildings. Debris rains down. Water ripples, reflecting shifting clouds. Camera pans, revealing more destruction. Birds scatter. \"C29\" appears.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The towering mushroom cloud violently expands, its core pulsating with unimaginable energy, sending shockwaves ripping through the city. Buildings twist and crumble with explosive force, debris launching into the sky. The sea itself is thrown into a chaotic frenzy, water erupting upward in furious geysers. The very \"c29\" letters shatter and reform, their fragments swirling around the devastation like a violent vortex, then snapping back into place.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A colossal mushroom cloud blooms downwards, pulling shattered debris back into impossibly whole buildings. The ocean surface reflects a fractal city, each ripple an infinitely regressing loop of destruction and reassembly. Birds fly backward, dissolving into streaks of sound, as colors bleed and morph across the sky, painting the collapsing reality with impossible hues. Time stitches itself into a kaleidoscopic ribbon where remnants of the \"c29\" disintegrate into stardust.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping pan reveals a city obliterated by a colossal nuclear blast, the mushroom cloud billowing skyward as fiery debris erupts outwards. The camera dramatically zooms through falling rubble, capturing crumbling buildings and a turbulent sea. Birds scatter in frantic flight against the ominous sky. A faint, unsettling glow emanates from the blast zone as \"c29\" flickers into view.",
