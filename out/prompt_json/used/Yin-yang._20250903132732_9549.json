  "video_prompt": "Yin and Yang symbol dynamically morphs, its dark side flowing and shifting like cosmic dust, light side pulsating with fiery energy. Concentric rings of light ripple outwards, glyphs within them subtly glowing and changing. Stars twinkle, nebulae drift, and celestial bodies pulse across a dark sky. A luminous terrestrial landscape below emanates a golden glow that waxes and wanes. The scene conveys constant cosmic balance and transformation.",
  "image_prompt": "A cosmic, mystical vertical image of a massive yin and yang symbol at the center, against a dark, starry sky with a celestial landscape below. The yin side is dark rock/cosmic dust with an ice-blue core; the yang side is fiery, turbulent energy with a radiant, fiery core. Concentric glowing golden rings with ancient symbols encircle it. The background features a dark cosmic expanse with stars, a bright star top-left, a nebula top-right, and small radiant objects in the sky. Below, a landscape of dark green, brown, and ochre mountains is illuminated by a brilliant golden light source at its center, creating an impression of cosmic balance and interconnectedness.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "The Yin and Yang symbol continually morphs, its dark side flowing and shifting like cosmic dust, its light side pulsating with fiery energy. Concentric light rings ripple outwards, glyphs within them subtly glow and transmute. Stars twinkle, nebulae drift, and celestial bodies pulse across the sky. A luminous landscape below emanates a golden glow that waxes and wanes."
