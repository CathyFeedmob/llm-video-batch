    "video_prompt": "A slight shimmer effect on the glowing trees, making them pulsate gently. Tiny luminous sparks ascend from the glowing leaves and trees. Fallen leaves on the ground gently rustle as if caught in a subtle breeze. A very slow, imperceptible forward camera push, giving a sense of drifting deeper into the colorful forest.",
    "image_prompt": "A captivating fantasy forest scene featuring bioluminescent trees and vibrant foliage. The composition is framed by two large, dark tree trunks on either side, creating a natural archway. Through this arch, a path paved with multicolored leaves recedes into a soft, glowing mist in the distance.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Trees:** Majestic, tall trees with dark, gnarled trunks and branches. Their leaves are large, fan-like, and emit a soft, ethereal glow, resembling giant, glowing mushrooms or floral structures. The tree branches are intricate and extend upwards to fill the sky.\n*   **Leaves/Foliage:** The ground is covered with a dense carpet of autumnal leaves in various shapes and sizes, primarily maple-like, in a rich palette of reds, oranges, yellows, purples, and blues. Some larger, plant-like leaves or flowers in similar vibrant colors stand upright along the sides of the path.\n*   **Light/Glow:** The most striking feature is the bioluminescence of the tree leaves, which glow in bright shades of purple, blue, cyan, orange, and red. Tiny sparkling lights or stars are scattered across these glowing leaves and in the soft, misty sky.\n*   **Path:** A winding path is visible, leading from the foreground into the haziness of the background, creating a sense of depth and journey.\n\n**Style:**\nFantasy, whimsical, magical, illustrative, dreamlike, art nouveau inspired with glowing elements. The style has a slightly animated or digital painting feel.\n\n**Composition:**\nSymmetrical framing with the two large trees. Deep perspective created by the winding path and receding fog. The vibrant colors of the foreground foliage draw the eye, while the glowing trees and starry patterns create a sense of wonder.\n\n**Colors:**\nA rich and diverse color palette dominates, with deep purples, radiant blues, electric cyans, fiery oranges, warm reds, and golden yellows for the glowing foliage and ground cover. The tree trunks are dark brown/purple, providing a strong contrast. The background sky transitions from light blue to a soft purple haze.\n\n**Lighting:**\nSoft, diffused, and emanating primarily from the bioluminescent leaves of the trees. There's an overall glow that illuminates the scene, suggesting either twilight or a world without a conventional sun. Sparkles act as accent lights.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nEnchanting, serene, mystical, and otherworldly. It evokes a sense of calm wonder and discovery, like stepping into a fairy tale.\n\n**Prompt Keywords:**\nfantasy forest, bioluminescent trees, glowing leaves, magical pathway, vibrant foliage, colorful autumn leaves, whimsical, dreamlike, enchanted, mystical, starry glow, shimmering light, deep perspective, digital painting, art nouveau inspired, orange trees, purple trees, blue trees, winding path, soft mist, ethereal, detailed illustration.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Glowing trees softly pulsate with a subtle shimmer. Luminous sparks drift upwards from foliage. Fallen leaves gently rustle and shift. The camera imperceptibly glides forward, drawing the viewer deeper.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Raging storm wind whips through the forest, violent currents tearing at the glowing trees! Leaves explode upwards in chaotic bursts, showering the path with furious sparks! The ground heaves and cracks as ancient roots aggressively protrude, seizing and flinging leaves into the distorted sky! The camera violently lurches forward, then slams backward, disorienting the viewer in a dizzying vortex!**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The glowing trees pulsate intensely, their leaves shimmering and then transforming into iridescent butterflies that fly upwards, reversing into leaves mid-air. Fallen leaves on the ground detach and ascend, reattaching to the branches, changing color and light with each shift. Colors bleed across the scene, creating new hues. The camera slowly pushes forward, warping the forest's perspective.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, ethereal zoom-in reveals the shimmering, pulsating trees. Tiny luminous sparks ascend, catching the light as the camera sweeps through the forest, revealing the rustling fallen leaves. A wide, sweeping shot showcases the path, gently pushing forward, drawing the viewer deeper into the vibrant, mysterious depths of the glowing forest.",
