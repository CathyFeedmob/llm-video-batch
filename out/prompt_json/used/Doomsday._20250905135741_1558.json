  "video_prompt": "A colossal mechanical centipede with glowing eyes and smoking back advances towards a molten, \"apple-cored\" Earth. Debris-filled rings shatter and orbit, while small mechanical orbs with prongs move around the scene. Streaking light emanates from Earth's wound as root-like structures extend, all against a subtly shifting cosmic background.",
  "image_prompt": "A detailed, wide-angle, medium shot of a catastrophic event in deep space. A massive, steampunk-like segmented centipede-like mechanical creature with a glowing green eye dominates the right, emitting dark smoke. Its appendage reaches towards a distressed Earth, prominently positioned slightly left of center. The Earth features recognizable continents, but a large portion over North America is a fiery red, molten \"apple core\" or \"bite mark\" with internal light and streaking molten veins, symbolizing intense destruction. Dark, root-like structures protrude from this wound. Surrounding the Earth is a vast, spiky, dark grey and brown debris ring, emitting a glowing, dusty light. Scattered smaller, dark, prongs-equipped mechanical orbs are present, some connected to the centipede. The background is deep space with faint stars and nebulous clouds, lit by a bright, lens-flare-like source in the top left. The scene blend science fiction with cosmic horror, suggesting the creature is consuming Earth.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A colossal mechanical centipede advances, its back smoking. The molten Earth pulsates, as root-like structures actively extend from its core, emitting streaking light. Debris rings shatter and continuously orbit. Small mechanical orbs drift and swirl across the scene, against a subtly shifting cosmic background."
