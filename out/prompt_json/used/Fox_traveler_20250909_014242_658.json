    "video_prompt": "Gentle sway of the fox's fur and clothing in a soft breeze. Subtle eye blink and head turn. Shimmer and slight movement of the beads and charms on the necklaces. Ribbons hanging from the umbrella softly flutter. Distant pagoda in the background shows subtle atmospheric haze, perhaps shifting slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "A full-body digital painting of a sophisticated anthropomorphic red fox character, styled as an East Asian traveler or monk, holding a traditional paper umbrella in one hand and a walking stick in the other. The fox has piercing yellow eyes and a thoughtful expression, with a detailed fur texture.\n\nThe character is dressed in a dark, loose-fitting robe or kimono, cinched at the waist with a red sash. Multiple intricate necklaces with various beads, charms, and a prominent circular medallion adorn the neck, along with metal bangles and wrapped bindings on the forearms and wrists. A single clove of garlic hangs from a string attached to the waist.\n\nThe composition is a vertical portrait, with the character occupying the majority of the frame, slightly off-center. The background features a muted, hazy East Asian landscape with traditional temple or pagoda roofs visible through a soft, overcast sky. The color palette is dominated by earthy tones: warm reds and oranges for the fox's fur, deep blues and blacks for the clothing, and muted greens, browns, and grays for the accessories and background.\n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, characteristic of an overcast day, creating subtle shadows and highlighting the textures of the fur and fabric. The overall atmosphere is mystical, serene, and adventurous, suggestive of a journey or a wise guardian. Traditional East Asian architectural elements, colorful ribbons hanging from the umbrella, and various bells and ornaments contribute to the cultural aesthetic. The art style is painterly, with visible brushstrokes, reminiscent of fantasy concept art or character design.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Fox's fur and clothing gently sway. Eyes subtly blink, head softly turns. Beads and charms on necklaces shimmer and shift. Umbrella ribbons softly flutter. Distant pagoda hazily shimmers, subtly shifting.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Fox's fur bristles violently, clothing rips and flutters chaotically. Eyes flash with aggressive intensity as its head snaps, snarling. Beads and charms explode from necklaces, scattering. Umbrella ribbons whip into a frenzy, tearing. Distant pagodas ripple and morph, erupting with dark energy. Ground cracks and shatters beneath the fox's powerful strides. Rain turns to sharp, striking hail.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fox's fur pulsates, its strands morphing into swirling galaxies. Beads on necklaces detach, orbiting the fox's head before coalescing into shimmering, liquid shapes. The umbrella's ribbons writhe like sentient snakes, pulling the pagoda from the distant haze and reassembling it as a crystalline spire within the umbrella's dome. Gravity warps, and the fox's paw gently ascends, hovering just above the ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Medium shot, camera slowly tracks right as the fox's head turns, eyes narrowing slightly, catching the light. The breeze intensifies, making the umbrella ribbons and beads on the necklaces dramatically flutter and sway. Focus rack from the fox to the distant pagoda, shrouded in an ethereal, shifting haze, hinting at an ancient mystery. Soft, cinematic lighting enhances the dramatic mood.",
