    "video_prompt": "Falling snow drifts gently, smoke curls from chimneys, the skier glides down the path with subtle arm and leg movements and a slight sway of their jacket, the cat's whiskers subtly twitch and its eyes blink.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical and surreal winter scene, captured with a wide-angle lens using a tilt-shift effect, creating a miniature world illusion. The central focus is an enormous, fluffy orange tabby cat with detailed fur and striking green-gold eyes, peering down into a snow-covered village. The cat's face and one paw are prominently featured in the middle ground, making up a significant portion of the frame.\n\nThe village below consists of numerous small, cozy wooden houses with snow-covered roofs, some with chimneys emitting white smoke, scattered amongst snow-dusted evergreen trees. A winding snowy road or ski slope leads through the village, and a tiny skier in a grey suit and blue helmet is actively skiing on this path in the foreground.\n\nThe overall color palette is dominated by cool blues and whites of the snow and sky, contrasting with the warm oranges and browns of the cat's fur and the wooden houses. Soft, natural sunlight illuminates the scene, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the texture of the snow and the cat's fur. Light, fluffy snowflakes are falling throughout the image, adding to the serene winter atmosphere. The sky in the background shows distant, snow-capped mountains. The composition feels grand yet intimate due to the extreme difference in scale.\n\n**Prompt:**\nA wide-angle, tilt-shift photograph of an enormous, fluffy orange tabby cat observing a miniature winter village from above. The cat's detailed fur, striking green-gold eyes, and one paw are the main focus in the midground. Below, a charming village with cozy, snow-covered wooden houses and small evergreen trees. A miniature skier in a grey suit and blue helmet is skiing on a winding snowy path in the foreground. Abundant falling snowflakes. Dominant cool blues and whites for snow and sky, contrasting with warm oranges and browns of the cat and houses. Soft natural lighting, casting subtle shadows. Distant snow-capped mountains in the background. Grand and intimate composition. Whimsical, surreal, miniature world illusion. Photorealistic with a fantasy twist.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Gentle snow drift, curling chimney smoke, skier's subtle limb and jacket sway, twitching whiskers and blinking cat eyes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Giant cat snarls, fur bristling, and lunges, its shadow engulfing the miniature ski village. Snow explodes under an unseen force. Chimneys erupt with violently spiraling smoke. The lone skier, caught in the rapid, chaotic descent, suddenly accelerates, skis carving aggressive, impossible turns, arms flailing desperately to maintain balance against the gale. The cat's eyes flash, its tail lashes, and the entire landscape shakes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The giant cat's eyes blink inwards, unraveling reality, as its whiskers retract like clock springs, pulling the falling snow upwards into nascent clouds. Smoke un-curls from chimneys, sucking houses inward. The skier glides backward, ascending the path, their skis morphing into wings, jacket feathers unfurling as they levitate towards the vanishing cat. The snowy path ripples into a liquid silver river, houses dissolving into reflections.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic prompt:**\n\nGentle snow begins falling, smoke billows from chimneys, the skier dramatically skids, throwing snow, then glides with powerful, sweeping arm motions. Simultaneously, the gigantic cat's eyes slowly blink, its head subtly tilts, and one massive paw gently lowers, stirring the houses, while its whiskers twitch creating a faint rustling sound in the snow. Close-up on the skier's widening eyes as the paw descends. The cat blinks again, surveying its miniature world.",
