    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, dynamic shot of a 3D animated Mario character running energetically, surrounded by a swirling tunnel of glowing, multi-colored confetti and abstract geometric shapes (cubes, spheres). The background is a dark, gradient blue, enhancing the bright, neon glow of the shapes and the text \"c29\" in the bottom right corner, which is also bright blue and luminous.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Character:** Mario, in his classic blue overalls, red shirt, white gloves, and brown shoes. His expression is joyful and determined. Rendered with a glossy, slightly stylized, almost clay-like texture, suggesting a high-quality 3D render.\n*   **Confetti/Shapes:** Thousands of small, brightly colored (pink, yellow, green, blue, orange, purple) 3D cubes and dots trailing behind Mario in dynamic, wavy lines, creating a sense of extreme speed and movement. Some shapes are larger and more distinct, while others are tiny particles. They appear to be interacting with light, possibly emitting it.\n*   **Text:** \"c29\" in a glowing, futuristic sans-serif font, bright blue/cyan, positioned in the lower right corner, seemingly behind some of the visual effects.\n\n**Style:**\n*   3D Rendered, High-Fidelity Animation, Stylized, Playful, Energetic, Vibrant, Modern, Digital Art.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Angle:** Slight low-angle shot looking up at Mario, emphasizing his forward motion and upward trajectory.\n*   **Subject Placement:** Mario is positioned centrally, slightly to the left, and mid-jump/stride, drawing the eye.\n*   **Dynamic Lines:** The confetti and abstract shapes create strong diagonal and curved lines leading from the background towards and past Mario, emphasizing speed.\n*   **Depth of Field:** Shallow depth of field; Mario is sharp and in focus, while the background and the furthest trails of confetti are slightly blurred, enhancing the sense of motion.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Bright primary and secondary colors (red, blue, yellow, green, pink, purple, orange) for the confetti/shapes; Mario's classic red and blue.\n*   **Background:** Deep blue to almost black gradient, providing strong contrast to the bright elements.\n*   **Luminescence:** Strong glowing effects on the confetti, lines, and text in bright blue/cyan and various vibrant hues.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Source:** Internal glow from the confetti/shapes and the text.\n*   **Effect:** Creates a luminous, ethereal, and energetic atmosphere. Rim lighting on Mario's silhouette from the bright background elements.\n*   **Shadows:** Soft shadows, mostly implied by the 3D rendering rather than stark, directional light source.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Exciting, celebratory, fast-paced, digital, magical, and futuristic. The overall mood is one of joy and exhilarating speed.\n\n**Prompt Example:**\n\"A highly detailed, vibrant 3D render of Mario mid-stride, running at extreme speed. He wears classic red and blue overalls, with a joyful expression. Thousands of glowing, multi-colored abstract 3D cubes and particles emanate and trail behind him in swirling, dynamic streaks, creating a tunnel effect. The background is a deep, dark blue gradient, making the bright neon colors pop. Strong sense of motion and luminescence. In the bottom right, luminous blue text 'c29' is visible, slightly obscured by the effects. High-quality 3D animation, volumetric lighting, epic speed trails, festive, particle effects.\"",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Mario's hair violently flails as an explosive burst of confetti and razor-sharp cubes tear past him, ripping through the air with destructive force. Dust particles ignite into fiery trails around his feet, propelling him forward in a sudden, impossible lurch. The \"c29\" graphic pulsates erratically, momentarily blinding before exploding into a shower of brilliant, superheated sparks.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Mario's solid hair fluidly undulates like liquid metal, pulling confetti *inwards* through glowing portals, defying its outward motion. Cubes become iridescent smoke, swirling and reforming into impossible geometries, accelerating *backward* into his steps. Feet dissolve into shimmering stardust, leaving behind ethereal trails that ripple and stretch the very fabric of space, bending light around the impossible \"c29\" that winks in and out of existence.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically tracks Mario as he sprints, his hair subtly bouncing, through a vibrant vortex of confetti and cubes that swirl, creating an explosion of colors and dynamic movement. Dust particles shimmer and dance around his feet, while the \"c29\" graphic pulses with an ethereal glow, casting shifting shadows that amplify the sense of speed and wonder.",
