    "video_prompt": "Subtle ripples expand on the green \"water\" surface, the bridge subtly sways, miniature figures slightly shift their positions and tiny birds occasionally flutter their wings. A gentle shimmer emanates from the orange \"gems\". Soft, flowing movement of the green \"drip\" icing.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the cake:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA visually stunning, whimsical photo of a multi-tiered cake designed as a miniature edible landscape. The cake is primarily covered in a vibrant, glossy light green glaze with a swirling textural pattern. Darker green glaze drips elegantly down the sides of the white frosted lower tier, which rests on a crumbly brown base.\n\nThe top tier of the cake features two prominent, detailed \"mountains\" made of textured brown and green cake, each topped with white \"snow\" icing and a distinct, vibrant orange peak. One mountain has a miniature electrical pole with wires extending towards a grey arched bridge connecting to another section of the cake. The other mountain is more rounded, with its base made of a crumbly brown texture, appearing to have a small cave entrance.\n\nBetween these mountains, a smooth, turquoise-blue \"river\" or \"lake\" section is visible, with a small, intricately detailed brown sailboat with a light pink sail floating on its surface. Miniature, realistic-looking brown birds are perched on the mountain peaks and near the sailboat. Several tiny, miniature human figures are scattered across the landscape: some appear to be working with small, square, crumbly brown blocks near the cave, while others are standing or interacting with the scene.\n\nScattered across the green glaze are fluffy white \"clouds\" and several small, translucent orange-gold jelly-like spheres. The overall composition is a low-angle, eye-level shot, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the cake in sharp focus while the background is softly blurred with bokeh lights, suggesting a festive or warm indoor setting. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the textures and vibrant colors. The atmosphere is playful, imaginative, and inviting. A faint \"C29\" watermark is visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle ripples expand across the green surface. The miniature bridge sways gently, and figures shift positions. Tiny birds occasionally flutter their wings. A gentle shimmer emanates from the orange gems. The green \"drip\" icing flows softly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Waves violently crash on the emerald \"ocean,\" the bridge contorts and collapses. Microscopic figures are flung into the air, birds dive like missiles. Fiery \"gems\" explode, spewing molten fragments. Virulent green icing rips across the cake, devouring everything in a chaotic, monstrous surge.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The green \"water\" ripples into negative space, revealing a cosmos where \"gems\" are black holes sucking in ambient light. The bridge, now a rainbow, stretches infinitely, carrying the miniature figures as they dance on air, their forms shifting like nebulae. Birds, with wings of pure starlight, sing silent symphonies backward in time. The green \"drip\" icing defies gravity, flowing upward into the cake, solidifying into crystal structures, then melting back into a liquid that turns the cake into cotton candy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, sweeping crane shot reveals the miniature world. A bird swoops down, snatched by a colossal claw, sending ripples outwards. The bridge dramatically collapses. A miniature figure heroically leaps from the collapsing bridge, caught by another bird. The green liquid drips faster, forming a terrifying waterfall. The shot tightens, focusing on the figure's determined face. The \"orange gems\" pulsate with an eerie glow as the world transforms.",
