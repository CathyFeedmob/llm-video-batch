  "video_prompt": "A woman with long, flowing purple hair and intensely glowing purple eyes stands. Her neon green cape billows, its ethereal glow pulsing. From a light-blue object in her hand, a multi-colored energy orb emanates, pulsating with internal structures. Green energy tendrils extend from the orb into a fallen zombie, whose glowing green blood pulses. Two grotesque zombies approach: one lunges forward with trailing green lightning, the other aggressively leaps, streaking with green energy across the desolate, fiery orange desert. The dramatic sky subtly shifts, reflecting an ongoing, irradiated struggle.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n\"A striking woman with long flowing bright purple hair and intense glowing purple eyes, wearing a dark form-fitting outfit, high collar, choker, medallion, and a long translucent cape glowing neon green. She stands confidently in a desolate post-apocalyptic desert under a fiery orange sky with a large dark radioactive symbol silhouette and a hazy sun. Crumbling ancient ruins are to the far left. In her right hand, she wields a glowing light-blue cylindrical object, from which a vibrant multi-colored energy orb (purple, blue, pink, yellow) with a detailed virus-like structure emanates. This orb directs green energy tendrils into the chest of a fallen, severely decayed zombie-like figure, revealing exposed ribs, torn flesh, and glowing green blood. In the midground, two grotesque zombie-like figures approach, one gaunt and lunging, the other skeletal and leaping, both trailing green energy. Barren sandy desert ground with scattered rocks. A vibrant, action-packed, supernatural sci-fi fantasy scene with dramatic lighting, conveying a grim, irradiated future.\"",
