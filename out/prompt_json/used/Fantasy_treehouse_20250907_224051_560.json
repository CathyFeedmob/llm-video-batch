    "video_prompt": "A gentle sway of the long strands of vines hanging from the tree branch, subtle rustling of leaves on the tree and plants, the fairy's wings subtly flutter, a slight shift in her posture, her hair gently blows, the lantern light flickers softly, and small shimmering particles drift in the background.",
    "image_prompt": "Whimsical, enchanted forest scene with a tree acting as a home and pathway. A large, textured tree trunk forms the central structure, covered with a lush array of multi-colored, fan-shaped mushrooms in various sizes (pastel blue, cream, purple, peach, and blush pink). Green foliage, succulents, and small flowering plants are interwoven around the mushrooms and tree bark.\n\nA cozy, rustic wooden alcove is built into the tree trunk, serving as a bedroom with a glowing arched window. Inside, a simple yet inviting bed with light blue bedding is visible, along with small wooden furniture pieces. A delicate, white-haired fairy with translucent wings, wearing a flowing light blue dress, stands on a moss-covered branch that extends from the tree. She is looking towards the left, her back slightly turned to the viewer.\n\nThe branch she stands on is also adorned with various green foliage, succulents, and small pastel-colored flowers. A small, lit lantern sits near her on the branch. In the background, there's a soft, ethereal blue-green haze, with subtle, translucent, bell-shaped floating elements adding to the magical atmosphere. The lighting is soft and warm, highlighting the glowing window and the fairy. The overall style is illustrative and fantastical, with a dreamlike quality and intricate details in the flora. \"c29\" in gray and white at the bottom right.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Vines sway; leaves rustle; wings, hair, and posture subtly shift; lantern flickers; particles drift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A violent earthquake rips through the tree, sending ancient mushrooms EXPLODING off the trunk. Vines thrash wildly, ripping apart. The fairy SCREAMS as her wings SHATTER into a million pieces. The lantern bursts into FLAMES, showering sparks. A tidal wave of shimmering particles ERUPTS from the background, consuming everything.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The tree branches coil and uncoil, releasing luminescent mushrooms that float upwards like ethereal balloons. The fairy's iridescent wings ripple into a kaleidoscope of liquid colors, propelling her not forward, but sideways through an impossibly layered forest. Her hair transforms into living vines, extending to entwine with spectral, reverse-falling raindrops. The lantern's light blooms outwards, solidifying into solid, crystalline pathways that twist and disappear into a swirling vortex of melting dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The scene opens with a slow, dramatic pull-back from the illuminated fairy home, revealing the intricately detailed mushroom tree. The camera then makes a slow, sweeping arc around the majestic tree as the long vines gently sway. As the camera focuses on the fairy, a sudden gust of wind causes her hair and dress to billow dramatically, her wings flutter intensely, and the lantern flickers wildly. She reacts with a subtle, yet powerful, shift in posture, gazing out into the shimmering, mystic-filled void as the wind dies down to a gentle breeze.",
