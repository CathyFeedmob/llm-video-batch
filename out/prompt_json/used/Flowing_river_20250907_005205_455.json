    "video_prompt": "Subtle water ripples and reflections, gentle shimmer of light on water and distant particles, slight sway of trees.",
    "image_prompt": "A beautiful, highly detailed vertical shot of a narrow river flowing through a lush, miniature landscape. The river, with deep blue water, meanders from the top of the frame towards the bottom, reflecting bright, sparkling light from an unseen source. The banks of the river are covered in various shades of green shrubbery and small pine trees, with scattered dark grey rocks and pebbles. The ground cover consists of small, round, brown granular textures that look like tiny berries or seeds, contrasted with patches of vibrant green moss-like growth.\n\nThe overall lighting is warm and ethereal, as if at sunset or sunrise, with bright, de-focused circular bokeh effects of varying sizes floating in the air, creating a magical, dreamlike atmosphere. A large, bright golden sun is visible in the upper right corner, casting a warm glow over the scene. The sky above is a gradient of deep blue to a lighter, softer blue near the horizon. The background features blurred, dark green hills or mountains, adding depth to the scene. The composition uses a shallow depth of field, with the foreground and mid-ground sharp, and the background softly blurred, enhancing the miniature effect. The colors are rich and vibrant, dominated by blues, greens, and warm golden tones.\n\n**Visual Elements:** Narrow winding river, lush riverbanks, small pine trees, rocks, pebbles, granular ground cover, moss-like growth, large bright sun, hills/mountains.\n**Style:** Miniature landscape, highly detailed, photorealistic with a magical/dreamlike quality.\n**Composition:** Vertical shot, S-curve leading lines of the river, shallow depth of field.\n**Colors:** Deep blue (river, sky), various greens (trees, foliage), warm golden tones (sun, bokeh, reflections), dark grey/brown (rocks, ground cover).\n**Lighting:** Warm, ethereal, bright, sunlit, highly reflective water, abundant bokeh.\n**Atmosphere:** Magical, serene, peaceful, natural, dreamlike, inviting.\n\n**Prompt:**\nA vertical, photorealistic, highly detailed image of a miniature river scene. A narrow, dark blue river with sparkling reflections, forms an S-curve, winding through lush, vibrant green banks. Small, textured pine trees and scattered dark grey rocks adorn the riverbanks, which are covered in rich brown granular soil and patches of mossy green ground cover. The scene is bathed in warm, ethereal golden hour lighting, with a large, bright golden sun in the upper right and numerous shimmering, out-of-focus bokeh lights of various sizes floating above the landscape. The sky is a gradient from deep blue to lighter blue, and the background features softly blurred dark green hills. Shallow depth of field, magical, serene atmosphere.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle water ripples and reflections expand outwards. Gentle light shimmers across the water's surface, while distant particles drift lazily. Trees sway rhythmically from side to side.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Torrential river surges violently, water erupting upwards in chaotic geysers. Trees thrash wildly, branches whipping and leaves exploding into fiery particles. Distant mountains shudder, cracking open to reveal molten light. The sky rips apart as a blinding sun descends, firing scorching beams that hit the water, causing it to boil and vaporize instantly. Rocks launch into the air like missiles, shattering upon impact. Blinding light pulsates from everything.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity-defying water ripples ascend, pulling trees skyward as cosmic fireflies reverse their glow, coalescing into a shimmering moon. Sun-drenched particulate matter swirls into a liquid stream that flows uphill, creating impossible reflections of a shifting, kaleidoscopic sky. Rocks morph into fleeting bursts of light, then reform as trees, while the entire landscape gently inhales and exhales, a living, breathing dream.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle shot glides alongside the meandering river, the camera subtly swaying with the currents as golden starlight dances on the water's surface, reflecting the serene ambiance. Then, a dramatic push-in shot focuses on a single, luminous particle rising from the water, growing in intensity as it ascends. This pulls back to a sweeping aerial shot, revealing a verdant forest softly swaying in unison with the river's flow, as the sun dips lower, casting long, dramatic shadows across the landscape. The entire scene captures a moment of tranquil yet powerful wonder.",
