  "video_prompt": "Cherry blossom petals drift and fall, continuously coating a winding path and rippling water. Sunlight shimmers and reflects actively on the water's surface, creating dynamic, shifting bokeh. Trees sway gently, and their reflections ripple in the evolving waterscape.",
  "image_prompt": "A serene spring landscape with a winding path/waterfront lined with cherry blossom trees in full bloom. Clear, light blue sky with fluffy clouds, falling pink petals. A large, bright pink cherry blossom tree on the left. Gentle, warm glow from the sun with visible sun rays from the upper left. Paved pathway partially covered with fallen petals alongside a river/canal. Water reflects pink cherry blossoms and blue sky, with sparkling highlights and prominent sun reflections (bokeh) in the foreground, especially bottom right. Cherry blossom trees create a symmetrical, tunnel-like effect. Fresh green grass on the embankment. Tranquil, beautiful, dreamlike spring scene.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Cherry blossom petals continually descend, dynamically altering the path's appearance and generating evolving patterns across the water. Sunlight actively shimmers, casting shifting reflections and dynamic bokeh. Foliage gently sways; its undulating reflections continually reshape the waterscape."
