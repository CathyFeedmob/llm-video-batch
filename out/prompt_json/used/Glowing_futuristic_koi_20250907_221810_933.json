    "video_prompt": "Particle fields subtly drift and shimmer throughout the scene, especially around the koi. The light inside the arched enclosure pulsates gently. The outer concentric rings subtly expand and contract, with a slight flicker in their glow. The koi's fins and tail softly undulate as if suspended in water or a shimmering aura. The reflection of the koi on the ground beneath the enclosure shows a slight ripple effect.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant and futuristic image featuring a red and gold Koi fish, levitating within a glowing, arched, transparent enclosure. The fish is rendered with intricate scales and flowing fins, displaying a gradient of red, orange, and subtle pink hues. The enclosure has a digital texture within its transparent walls, subtly emitting a pale blue light.\n\nThe fish and its enclosure are centrally placed, with the fish facing slightly towards the right. The entire scene is set against a dark, cosmic-like background, filled with numerous tiny white speckles resembling stars or dust particles. Surrounding the main structure is a large, glowing white concentric ring that radiates bright light, with streaks of blue light emanating outwards, creating a sense of dynamic energy.\n\nThe foreground features a reflective surface, mirroring the fish and the lower part of the enclosure with a slightly blurred effect. This surface is adorned with intricate, glowing blue circuit-like patterns, reflecting light and enhancing the futuristic atmosphere. The overall lighting is bright and ethereal, highlighting the glowing elements and creating a contrast with the dark background. The color palette is dominated by glowing blues, crisp whites, and vibrant reds and golds.\n\nA subtle reflection of the fish and the lower section of the enclosure is visible on the highly reflective floor, which also features glowing blue circuit patterns. In the bottom right corner, a reflective metallic logo \"C29\" is present, adding to the digital and futuristic theme. The image conveys a mystical and high-tech atmosphere, blending natural beauty with advanced technology.\n\n**Detailed Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n```\nFull shot of a vibrant, intricately detailed red and gold Koi fish, levitating within a glowing, arched, transparent cylindrical enclosure. The fish features shimmering scales with a gradient of scarlet, orange, and soft pink, and flowing, translucent fins. The enclosure's transparent walls are embedded with subtle, glowing blue digital patterns, emitting a soft internal light.\n\nThe composition is centered, with the Koi slightly angled towards the viewer's right. The background is a dark, cosmic expanse filled with myriad tiny white luminous particles, resembling distant stars or glowing dust. A large, radiant white concentric halo encircles the entire setup, emitting bright light and dynamic streaks of sharp blue light rays radiating outwards, creating a powerful sense of energy and motion.\n\nThe foreground is a highly reflective floor surface, mirroring the Koi fish and the lower half of the enclosure with a clean, slightly diffused reflection. This reflective surface is adorned with complex, glowing cyan and blue circuit board-like patterns, enhancing the futuristic and high-tech ambiance.\n\nThe lighting is ethereal and luminous, emphasizing the glowing elements and contrasting sharply with the deep, dark background. The dominant color palette consists of brilliant blues (cyan, electric blue), crisp whites, and the rich, warm tones of the red and gold Koi. In the bottom right corner, a sleek, metallic silver \"C29\" logo with reflective properties is subtly integrated. The overall aesthetic blends natural beauty with advanced, mystical technology, creating a visually striking and imaginative scene.\n```",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The koi's fins and tail softly undulate, creating subtle ripples in its reflection. Particle fields drift and shimmer throughout, intensifying around the koi. The arched enclosure's interior light pulsates gently, while outer concentric rings subtly expand and contract with a flickering glow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Unleashed particle fields erupt and whip violently around the enraged koi.** The arched enclosure's internal light strobes erratically, blindingly. Outer concentric rings violently rupture outwards, their glow exploding into chaotic energy. The koi's fins and tail thrash and tear through the air, creating sonic booms. Its reflection on the ground beneath roils into a tempestuous vortex, the structure itself cracking.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The koi, encased, slowly morphs into iridescent stardust, sparkling outwards while its reflection on the impossible liquid floor coalesces into a new, smaller fish swimming upside down. The enclosing arch melts and reforms into a floating vortex of light that sucks in the ambient particles, only to emanate them in reverse. The outer rings ripple with sound, warping their own dimensions as they pass through invisible planes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The scene opens with a slow, dramatic pull-back, revealing the koi in its pulsating enclosure. The outer rings subtly contract and expand, casting ethereal light. The camera then smoothly glides around the enclosure, highlighting the koi's undulating fins and tail, the subtle shimmer of particle fields, and its rippling reflection. A soft, dynamic light shift emphasizes the koi's serene beauty within its futuristic prison, creating an enigmatic and almost sacred feel.",
