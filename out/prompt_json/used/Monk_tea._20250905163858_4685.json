Clear water droplets splash and suspend around the figure. Wispy clouds drift as a full moon radiates light, enhancing the ethereal glow and upward movement. \n",
  "image_prompt": "A stylized golden figure, resembling a monk or martial artist, gracefully floats in mid-air above a clear glass teacup filled with luminous golden liquid. The figure, made of translucent gold, is in a dynamic pose with hands in Anjali Mudra, emanating ethereal power and calm. Dynamic splashes of rich golden liquid and sparkling clear water swirl around the figure. The golden liquid pours into the glowing teacup. A dark, moody sky with wispy clouds and a luminous full moon in the background creates a magical, dusk/dawn ambiance.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A figure's golden robes flow dynamically as it slowly levitates, hands subtly shifting in a prayer-like gesture. Luminous golden liquid actively pours and swirls into a cup, its subtle reflections continuously shifting. Clear water droplets vigorously splash then suspend, orbiting the figure. Wispy clouds drift steadily, while a full moon radiates light, intensely enhancing the ethereal glow and the figure's upward movement."
