    "video_prompt": "Subtle dust motes drift across the foreground. The distant spacecraft's engine glow gently pulses. The large, cracked \"face\" on the fallen suit exhibits a faint, almost imperceptible surface crack shifting. The small astronaut's helmet visor subtly reflects and shifts the ambient light. A gentle, ethereal shimmer can be seen on the horizon.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on recreating the visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere of the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A surreal and desolate lunar landscape at twilight, dominated by a colossal, partially visible moon in the upper right, showing detailed craters and rugged texture. In the foreground, a vast, cracked, and dusty brownish-grey terrain with deep fissures and small craters. Lying fallen in a large crater-like depression in the mid-ground is a giant, extremely weathered and cracked statue of a cartoonish character (resembling \"Moomin\") wearing a damaged astronaut suit. The character's face is a light tan and visibly fractured, with sections missing or chipped. The astronaut suit is dirty white, grimy, and shows significant wear and tear, with rips and exposed internal components.\n\nIn the lower center, a human astronaut in a clean white suit stands with their back to the viewer, looking towards the giant fallen statue. To the right of the standing astronaut, a simple, weathered wooden cross or grave marker is partially visible, half-buried in the cracked earth. In the middle distance, extending towards the horizon, are low, rugged mountains shrouded in a thin atmospheric haze.\n\nHigh in the sky, to the left of the giant moon, a sleek, futuristic spaceship with glowing blue thrusters flies horizontally, seemingly heading away from the scene. The lighting is soft and diffuse, emanating from a low, unseen source, casting long, subtle shadows and highlighting textures. The overall color palette is muted and monochromatic, dominated by shades of brown, grey, and tan, with hints of very soft light blue from the thrusters and the distant atmosphere. The atmosphere is hazy and dusty, creating a sense of vastness and isolation. The mood is melancholic, mysterious, and awe-inspiring, with a touch of cosmic wonder and solitude. High detail, photorealistic, cinematic.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Dust motes drift. Engine glow pulses. A faint crack subtly shifts on the suit's \"face.\" The astronaut's visor reflects and shifts ambient light. An ethereal shimmer subtly moves on the horizon.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The massive face violently shatters, fragments launching outward. The distant spacecraft suddenly blasts off, leaving a fiery trail. The small astronaut's helmet visor flares blindingly, then dims. The entire barren landscape violently erupts, cracks spreading, sending dust and debris spiraling upward. A gravitational anomaly pulls the giant suit, lifting it briefly, then slamming it back down with a thunderous impact.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The large, cracked \"face\" on the fallen suit slowly deflates, its materials rippling inward like liquid while the helmet shatters into a galaxy of tiny, glowing shards. The distant spacecraft shrinks into a miniature toy, then expands into a colossal, crystalline bird, its engine glow becoming iridescent feathers that flutter through the air. The small astronaut's suit contorts, the fabric itself breathing and pulsing, as the ground below them melts into a reflection of the sprawling cosmos above.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone astronaut stares across a desolate lunar landscape. A colossal, cracked astronaut suit, resembling a cartoon character, lies before him. The camera slowly pans across the vast terrain, revealing a distant spacecraft casting an eerie glow on the horizon. The lens then rapidly zooms into the astronaut's visor, revealing a distorted reflection of the enigmatic figure. Subtle dust motes dance in the foreground, catching the faint light from the distant vessel. The camera dramatically pulls back, showing the entire scene, as the gentle, ethereal shimmer on the horizon intensifies, hinting at an approaching mystery.",
