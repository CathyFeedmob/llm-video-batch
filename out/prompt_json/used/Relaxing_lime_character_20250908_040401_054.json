    "video_prompt": "The lime character blinks and its mouth subtly widens into a smile. The palm tree leaves gentle sway. The ocean in the background has soft waves. The paper straws slightly wiggle in the glass. Tiny shimmering particles appear around the lime and glass, resembling condensation or refreshing mist. The camera subtly zooms in then out, mimicking a gentle breath.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, playful, and photorealistic close-up shot of a anthropomorphic lime character on a sunny beach. The lime, with textured skin, is sitting comfortably in a blue and white striped wooden deckchair. It wears a green fedora hat and trendy green sunglasses, and has a wide, happy, semi-open mouth. Its small, green, textured hands are holding a clear glass filled with a light green beverage, garnished with a slice of lime and two striped green and white straws.\n\nThe composition is a slightly low-angle, eye-level shot, focusing on the lime character. The background is a bright tropical beach scene with soft-focus. A palm tree is visible on the left, and the clear blue ocean with a slight shimmer or wave is on the right. The sand in the foreground is detailed with individual grains.\n\nThe lighting is bright, natural sunlight, creating crisp shadows under the deckchair and the lime. The colors are predominantly bright greens, blues, and sandy browns, conveying a cheerful and refreshing summer atmosphere. The overall style is whimsical and high-quality photorealism, almost like a 3D render. There is a white, rounded text \"C29\" at the bottom right corner with a subtle outline.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The lime blinks and smiles. Palm fronds sway. Ocean waves undulate softly. Paper straws gently wiggle. Tiny shimmering particles appear around the lime and glass. The camera subtly zooms in then out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The lime character's eyes snap open with aggressive delight, its mouth stretching impossibly wide into a manic grin. The palm tree violently thrashes in a sudden hurricane. The ocean erupts with monstrous, crashing waves. The paper straws violently jolt, flinging liquid from the glass. Electric, crackling energy bursts from the lime and glass, engulfing them in a shimmering, unstable aurora. The camera violently shakes, then plunges in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The lime character's sunglasses refract an inverse ocean, mirroring a purple sky. The palm tree's fronds unfurl like blossoming flowers, then retract into the trunk. The entire beach subtly tilts, pouring sand like liquid into the impossibly still ocean, which then drains into a void. The lime's arms stretch and embrace the entire drink, the liquid swirling into a nebula. The paper straws warp into living vines, growing fruit. The chair becomes fluid, rippling with the impossible breeze of a fourth dimension.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in reveals the lime character, eyes blinking open as its subtle smile widens, shifting focus from a gentle palm sway in the background. The camera then performs a sweeping arc to reveal soft ocean waves, while the paper straws in the glass begin to undulate. Shimmering particles cascade around the lime and glass, catching the light as a final, subtle zoom out reveals the entire tranquil scene, a breath of pure refreshment.",
