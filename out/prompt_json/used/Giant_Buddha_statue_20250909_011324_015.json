    "video_prompt": "Smog billows from industrial chimneys, a high-speed train glides along the elevated tracks, and subtle flickering lights emanate from neon signs and building interiors. Flying vehicles hover and traverse the cityscape. Steam drifts from vents on buildings and the train, while tiny sparks flicker within exposed machinery. The camera subtly tracks forward, revealing new details of the bustling street below and the towering structures.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A majestic, colossal, multi-armed ancient Buddha statue, reminiscent of Mahasthamaprapta or Guanyin, sits serenely at the focal point of a cyberpunk, sci-fi city. The statue is carved from rough, weathered stone, emitting a faint, warm glow from its base and holding a prominent, glowing fiery torch in one hand. The surrounding city is a densely packed metropolis with a clear neo-futuristic Asian influence, featuring intricate, stacked buildings with exposed pipes, gears, and structural elements. Some buildings display bright neon signs with Chinese characters.\n\nThe dominant color palette is warm, with a strong emphasis on rich oranges, deep browns, and subtle reds, contrasted by cooler hints of teal and light blues from various glowing elements and signage. The atmosphere is hazy and a bit smoky, with steam and exhaust rising from various structures, giving a sense of industrial activity. A detailed elevated train track with a classic, dark red train is visible in the lower left, with a bustling platform extending to the lower right, where numerous silhouetted figures can be seen walking. Several futuristic flying cars (speeders) with glowing undersides traverse the mid-ground.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic and directional, creating stark contrasts between illuminated areas and deep shadows, highlighting the statue and key city features. The overall composition is a dynamic, slightly low-angle perspective looking up towards the monument, creating a sense of awe and scale. The scene blends ancient spiritualism with a bustling, gritty high-tech future, evoking a Blade Runner-esque aesthetic with an East Asian twist. Volumetric lighting and atmospheric perspective add depth to the sprawling city in the background.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Smog plumes dynamically shift from chimneys. A high-speed train glides smoothly. Neon signs and interiors pulsate with flickering lights. Flying vehicles gracefully traverse and hover. Steam visibly drifts from vents. Tiny sparks actively flicker within machinery. The camera subtly tracks forward, revealing a flowing urban rhythm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Gigantic Buddha statue's multiple arms violently rip from its body, clawing at the sky! Buildings shudder, their frames contorting as if in agony. The train, a metal serpent, derails, hurtling through the air in a chaotic explosion of sparks and twisted steel. Flying vehicles dart and collide, their hulls shattering as fiery debris rains down. Industrial chimneys belch forth torrents of black smoke, forming a towering, swirling vortex that swallows the cityscape whole. Neon signs flicker erratically, pulsing with an unnatural, furious energy. Steam vents erupt like geysers, spewing superheated vapor in a deafening roar. The very ground buckles and cracks, revealing an angry, molten core beneath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The colossal Buddha shatters into iridescent dust, swirling upwards to coalesce into a shimmering nebula. Buildings fold inwards like origami, their lighted windows becoming flowing rivers of luminescence. The train elongates into a serpentine dragon of steam and steel, breathing fire as it soars through the sky. Flying vehicles morph into schools of ethereal jellyfish, pulsing with inner light. All elements flow and intertwine, defying gravity and logic in a mesmerizing dance of impossible transformation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The colossal Buddha statue looms, a silent sentinel over the sprawling, smoke-choked metropolis. A high-speed train roars through an elevated track, its windows aglow, as flying vehicles drift serenely through the smog. Steam billows from vents, and tiny sparks dance within the intricate machinery of the dilapidated city. The camera sweeps down, revealing bustling street life, then dramatically zooms in on the statue's serene countenance, before pulling back to encompass the city's overwhelming scale.",
