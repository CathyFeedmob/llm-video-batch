To the left, a comfortable navy blue sofa and armchair offer additional seating, accompanied by a small side table. The cave opens up to a breathtaking view of the vast, tranquil blue ocean under a clear sky. A wooden deck extends from the cave, featuring a small glass-sided plunge pool and a sun lounger, hinting at ultimate relaxation. The sunlight streams in from the opening, creating a natural lighting effect and casting shadows across the polished wooden floor. The overall atmosphere is one of serene luxury and natural beauty.\n\n**Visual elements:** Cave interior, large bed, white bedding, navy blue sofa, navy blue armchair, small side table, wooden deck, glass railing, plunge pool, sun loungers, ocean, clear sky, rock formations, natural light.\n**Style:** Luxurious, modern, natural, minimalist.\n**Composition:** Wide and deep shot, with the cave opening framing the ocean view.

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Blinding flash rips through cave, violently shaking rock walls! Ocean erupts in towering, chaotic waves! Bed linens thrash and writhe, morphing into spectral forms! The overhead lamp plunges downward, shattering the floor as the cave entrance explodes inward, revealing a hurricane of light!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses, pulling the bed into the cave ceiling while ocean waves ripple inward, growing miniature stalactites. The lamp elongates, becoming a serpentine creature coiling around an invisible pillar, its light phasing through spectrums. Linens undulate, revealing shimmering, translucent fish that swim through the fabric, occasionally bursting into ephemeral clouds of stardust. The cliff face outside softens, parts like curtains, and reveals an inverse sky, where inverted yachts sail on upside-down clouds.",

The camera then gracefully glides over the luxurious bed, following the gentle ripple across the sheets.
