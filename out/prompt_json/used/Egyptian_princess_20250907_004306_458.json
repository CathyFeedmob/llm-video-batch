    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on various elements to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A stunning, elegant Egyptian queen or goddess, centered and facing forward, with a captivating and composed expression. She has long, flowing dark hair and features consistent with Middle Eastern/North African ethnicity.\n\n**Attire & Accessories:** She wears an opulent, shimmering golden two-piece outfit consisting of a fitted top that reveals her midriff and a flowing, pleated long skirt. The outfit is richly adorned with intricate gold patterns, beads, and possibly small jewels. She wears a magnificent golden crown encrusted with blue and other gemstones, elaborate long dangling gold earrings, and a multi-layered gold necklace with similar gemstone embellishments. Her forearms are adorned with stacked golden bangles. A translucent, flowing veil of light gold or cream fabric drapes elegantly behind her, catching the light.\n\n**Environment:** She stands in the foreground on golden desert sand, with subtle sand dunes and sparse desert vegetation on either side in the middle ground. In the background, prominently featured and slightly to the left, is a large, ancient Egyptian pyramid, suggesting the Giza plateau. One or two distant palm trees are visible on the right side of the background.\n\n**Atmosphere & Lighting:** The scene is set during late afternoon or early evening, characterized by warm, golden hour lighting. The sky is a gradient of deep blue at the top, transitioning to soft oranges, yellows, and pinks near the horizon, indicative of a sunset or sunrise. A subtle light ray is visible descending from the upper right sky, illuminating part of the background. Abundant, shimmering golden particles or glitter emanate from behind and around the figure, creating a magical, ethereal glow and trailing outwards, particularly around her arms and the lower part of her dress.\n\n**Composition:** Full-body shot, centered, with the pyramid acting as a majestic backdrop. The perspective is eye-level, slightly looking up at the pyramid, giving a sense of grandeur. The overall feel is serene, mystical, and regal.\n\n**Art Style:** Highly realistic with a touch of fantastical elegance. Rich in detail and texture, especially in the clothing and jewelry. Soft, diffused lighting with dramatic highlights on the golden elements.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by rich golds, warm desert browns, and oranges, contrasted with deep blues and soft pinks in the sky. Accents of turquoise/blue in the jewelry.\n\n**Additional Notes:** Emphasize the exquisite craftsmanship of the costume and jewelry. Ensure the golden particles appear luminous and organic, creating a sense of movement.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle veil sway, fabric shimmer, particulate glitter, gentle eye blinks, imperceptible zoom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Pyramid shatters, sand whirls into a cyclone, the veil explodes into golden sparks, fabric violently whips around, jewelry pulsates with intense light. Eyes blaze open, lightning crackles from fingertips. Rapid, disorienting push-in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The golden fabric morphs into water, flowing upwards to form the pyramids. Sand dunes ripple like liquid, revealing ancient eyes that blink in reverse. Glittering particles condense into a shimmering galaxy, spiraling inwards to become single grains of sand. The veil stretches infinitely, becoming a portal through which the figure steps backward in time, becoming younger with each impossible stride as the sun sets in reverse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A majestic goddess, crowned and adorned in glimmering gold, emerges from the desert haze. The camera dramatically tracks forward, a light breeze subtly swaying her transparent veil and shimmering fabric, releasing a cloud of golden dust that dances in the air. Her eyes, filled with ancient wisdom, slowly blink, drawing the viewer deeper into her enigmatic presence. As she fully reveals herself, the pyramids of Giza dramatically loom in the background, bathed in the golden hour light.",
