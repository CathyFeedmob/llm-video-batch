    "video_prompt": "A young woman in a mech: blinking, very subtle shifts in her facial expression. The mech: very subtle, almost imperceptible twitching in the joints of the legs and arms, very faint internal hum and lights flickering inside the cockpit. Moon: extremely slow, barely noticeable rotation. Dust or very fine particles slowly drift across the moon's surface. Slight camera pan or zoom.",
    "image_prompt": "a stunning ultra detailed render of a woman piloting a huge robotic mech suit, sleek sci-fi design, on a lunar landscape with craters and debris, night sky, in the style of highly detailed cgi, octane render, unreal engine 5, digital illustration, smooth and elegant, hyperrealistic, intricate and precise, neon green highlights, studio light, cinematic lighting, dramatic volumetric lighting, 8k, photorealistic, intricate, high detail, sharp focus",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A young woman in a mech blinks with subtle facial shifts. The mech subtly twitches at its joints, emitting a faint hum and flickering internal lights. The moon slowly rotates as fine particles drift across its surface. The camera slightly pans or zooms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A young woman in a mech: quick head turns, sharp eye darting, sudden grin. The mech: powerful, slamming footfalls, arms punching through the dusty moon, rapid whirring and jolting, blinding flashes from cockpit. Moon: rapid rotation, dust devils swirling violently, rocks erupting from craters. Camera violently pans, zooms, and shakes, tracking the mech's explosive movements.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The mech's limbs float and stretch as if in liquid, merging with the lunar dust which swirls upward, coalescing into phantom structures that then dissolve into starlight. The woman's eyes refract rainbow hues, her reflection rippling, morphing into celestial bodies. The moon expands and contracts, its surface textures breathing like a cosmic lung, revealing glimpse of impossible architectures within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The immense mech, lights flickering within its cockpit, stands resolute amidst the desolate lunar landscape. A subtle facial twitch from the pilot is mirrored by the mech's almost imperceptible arm and leg movements. A faint hum resonates, barely audible against the slow rotation of the moon as dust drifts silently. The camera performs a slow, dramatic pull-away, revealing the grandeur of the mech against the vast lunar expanse.",
