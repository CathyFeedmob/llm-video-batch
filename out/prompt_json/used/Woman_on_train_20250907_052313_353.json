    "video_prompt": "The woman breathes softly, her chest rising and falling. Her hair subtly sways with the gentle rocking of the train while a slight breeze causes the strands near her face to drift. The coffee in the plastic cup gently ripples as the train moves, and the reflections on the laptop screen subtly shift with the changing light. Her eyes softly blink, and her expression maintains a contemplative gaze out the window as the landscape outside smoothly glides by.",
    "image_prompt": "A beautifully composed photo of a young woman with long blonde hair, wearing a stylish off-the-shoulder white ribbed sweater and blue jeans, sitting by a train window. She is looking out the window with a pensive expression, her right hand resting on her chin. \n\nThe natural light from the sunny day outside bathes her in a soft glow, highlighting her features and the texture of her sweater. On the train's fold-out table in front of her, there's a laptop, a sandwich wrapped in white paper, and two drinks in clear plastic cups with straws. The window offers a clear view of a vast, flat landscape under a bright blue sky, with distant buildings on the horizon. The interior of the train is visible, with a reddish-pink seat and the number \"c29\" subtly visible on the wall next to her legs. \n\nThe image has a bright, airy, and slightly melancholic atmosphere. The focus is sharp on the woman and the items on the table, with the background softly blurred to emphasize her and the immediate surroundings.\n\n**Visual elements:** Young woman, blonde hair, white off-the-shoulder sweater, blue jeans, train window, train interior, laptop, sandwich, two drinks in plastic cups, rural landscape, distant buildings, blue sky.\n**Style:** Realistic photography, natural light, subtly cinematic.\n**Composition:** Medium shot, rule of thirds applied with the woman positioned to the left, leading lines from the window and table.\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are blues (sky, jeans), whites (sweater, sandwich paper), browns/tans (landscape, drinks, table), and a pop of reddish-pink (seat).\n**Lighting:** Bright, natural daylight, soft direct light on the woman, clear reflections on the laptop screen.\n**Atmosphere:** Calm, contemplative, serene, slightly melancholic, peaceful travel scene.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A woman's chest softly rises and falls with her breath. Her hair gently sways with the rocking train, strands near her face subtly drifting in a breeze. Coffee ripples in a plastic cup. Reflections shift on a laptop screen. Her eyes softly blink, maintaining a contemplative gaze as the landscape glides by outside.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The woman's breath becomes a violent heave, throwing her head back as her hair whips wildly, lashing the air. The train jolts, flinging coffee from the cup in a chaotic, upward spray. The laptop screen explodes with a flashing, distorted light, reflecting a demonic transformation in her eyes as the landscape outside blurs into an impossibly fast, fiery streak.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's breath forms ethereal mist, coiling inversely into her lungs. Hair strands spiral like iridescent DNA, defying gravity. The coffee cup's surface shimmers, reflecting an impossible cosmos, while the liquid reverses, un-dissolving ice and swirling back into raw beans. The laptop screen shows a kaleidoscope of collapsing landscapes, each frame morphing into a new, impossible dimension. Her eyelids become crystalline, blinking out nebulae, as the train itself distorts, stretching into a time-bending wormhole.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "CLOSE UP on the woman's face, a slow PUSH IN as her eyes softly blink, revealing a slight tremor in her hand as it rests against her chin. Her blonde hair gently sways, some strands subtly dancing near her face. QUICK ZOOM OUT to reveal the coffee cup on the tray, the liquid rippling, reflecting the fleeting landscape outside the window, which is now blurs and rushes past, emphasizing the train's speed.",
