    "video_prompt": "Particle effects of debris and dust gently fall from the mushroom cloud and settled buildings, slight shimmer and undulation in the heat haze near the explosion's base, subtle water movement and gentle swaying of boats in the harbor.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-angle aerial view of a devastating atomic bomb explosion over a coastal city, seen from above. A massive, textured mushroom cloud, rich in earthy browns, greys, and whites, billows upwards from the center of the city. Beneath it, a fiery orange and red core of explosion ignites the scene, casting chaotic light and shadow across the destroyed urban landscape. Smoke and debris billow outwards, engulfing buildings and creating a sense of utter devastation.\n\nThe city below is heavily damaged, with buildings appearing partially collapsed, scorched, and reduced to rubble. Some structures closer to the explosion are engulfed in flames. The urban sprawl extends towards a large body of water, likely an ocean or bay, where the destroyed cityscape meets the shoreline. Several piers and boats, some appearing sunken or damaged, are visible along the coastline.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic, with the explosion serving as the primary light source, creating strong contrasts and dynamic shadows. The sky above is a blend of pale blues and whites, with distant mountains or hills visible on the horizon, hinting at the vastness of the disaster. The overall atmosphere is one of immense destruction, chaos, and a chilling sense of scale. In the bottom right corner, a white, distressed \"c29\" font sits against the dark water. The style is hyperrealistic with a grim, disaster-movie aesthetic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Debris and dust gently fall from the mushroom cloud and settled buildings. Heat haze near the explosion's base shimmers and undulates. Water subtly moves, and boats gently sway in the harbor.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings rupture and explode into shrapnel. Debris rains down with violent force, dust clouds billow aggressively. Heat haze pulses, warping reality. Water churns into chaotic maelstroms, boats hurled like toys. Mushroom cloud violently expands, fire bursts outwards, consuming all. Ground shakes, cracks ripple, swallowing structures whole. Explosions reverberate, tearing through the landscape with relentless fury.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Debris and dust from the mushroom cloud ascend, reversing into its origin, forming spectral structures. Heat haze at the explosion's base solidifies into shimmering, impossible geometries that pulsate and ripple upwards against gravity. Boats in the harbor melt into liquid shadows, reconfiguring into ephemeral birds that take flight, scattering across the water's surface as fractured reflections of the sky, before dissolving into pure light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A high-angle drone shot surveys the devastation, subtly panning right to reveal the mushroom cloud's fiery base. Debris descends in slow-motion tendrils. The camera glides down, revealing the harbor as boats gently rock, reflecting heat haze. A sudden, subtle ground tremor causes ripple effects across the water. A final, close-up shot of the \"c29\" text shimmers, dust settling on its edges.",
