    "video_prompt": "Slow zoom into the crocodile. The crocodile's eyes blink. The head of the crocodile subtly turns left, then right. Slight movement in the apple held by the crocodile. The leaves on the apple gently sway. The toothbrush bristles subtly flex. Glimmer on the \"C29\" logo. Subtle dust particles drift in the air, catching the light from the window. The reflection of sunlight on the wooden floor subtly shifts and brightens.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that could recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA cute, stylized cartoon alligator character standing upright, smiling broadly with its mouth open, showcasing its white teeth and pink tongue. The alligator is green with a ridged back and a cream-colored, segmented belly. It holds a blue toothbrush with white bristles in its left hand (viewer's right) and a plump, red apple with a small green leaf in its right hand (viewer's left).\n\nThe scene is set indoors, depicting a vibrant and warm-toned classroom or playroom. A large, arched wooden window on the left side reveals a bright blue sky and lush green trees outside, letting in natural sunlight that creates warm highlights and shadows. The walls are a cheerful yellow adorned with scattered, flat geometric shapes (triangles, rectangles) in various pastel colors like teal, pink, and peach. Towards the top right, a colorful bunting banner hangs.\n\nIn the background on the right, there's a light blue bookshelf with several multi-colored books stacked vertically. Below it, a small, light blue wooden stool holds a stack of books. On the wooden floor in the foreground, two brightly colored spherical toys, one orange and one blue, are scattered. Another orange spherical toy is visible near the bottom right. The overall lighting is bright and cheerful, suggesting daylight. The style is 3D rendered, with smooth textures and a playful, inviting atmosphere suitable for children's media. A stylized, colorful logo \"c29\" is overlaid in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movement-Focused Video Prompt:**\n\nSlow, continuous zoom inwards. Crocodile's eyes blink. Crocodile's head subtly turns left, then right. Apple subtly sways within crocodile's grip. Apple leaves gently undulate. Toothbrush bristles subtly flex. \"C29\" logo glimmers. Dust particles drift, catching light. Sunlight reflection on the floor subtly shifts and brightens.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Explosive zoom into the enraged crocodile! Its eyes violently twitch and bulge. The crocodile's head snaps left, then violently jerks right. The apple in its grasp shatters into a showering explosion of pulp and seeds, its leaves rapidly shredding. The toothbrush bristles violently vibrate and spark. The entire \"C29\" logo rapidly explodes into brilliant light and then dissolves. The wooden floor boards dramatically warp and splinter, flinging dust and debris violently into the air as the sunlight strobes erratically!**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A shimmering portal opens in the window, pulling the crocodile's eyeball inward, then spitting it back out. The apple he holds melts into liquid gold, splattering upwards onto the ceiling, forming constellations. The toothbrush transforms into a flock of miniature hummingbirds, flying backward into the crocodile's mouth, growing teeth as they enter. The \"C29\" logo dissolves into a kaleidoscope of screaming colors, reforming as a black hole that swallows the entire room.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly pushes into the crocodile, eyes blinking with surprise. Its head subtly shifts, scanning the room. A dramatic close-up on the apple reveals it's now sparkling, as sunlight glints through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The toothbrush bristles quivering slightly, hinting at an impending use. The C29 logo shimmers, pulling focus as the camera tracks back to reveal the crocodile's full, grand stance.",
