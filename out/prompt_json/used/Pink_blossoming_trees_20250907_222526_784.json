    "video_prompt": "Gentle ripples spread across the water's surface, causing the reflections of the trees and their pink blossoms to subtly undulate and shift. Individual pink petals occasionally fall from the trees and softly land on the water, drifting away. A very slow, imperceptible drift of the camera horizontally to the right.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant spring landscape featuring a row of full, pink blooming trees lining the edge of a serene lake. The trees are predominantly covered in small, bright pink flowers, with some green foliage visible, especially on the left side of the image. The trees' trunks are dark brown and stand along a well-maintained grassy embankment with a stone or concrete retaining wall at the water's edge.\n\nThe calm surface of the lake perfectly reflects the trees and their pink blossoms, creating a symmetric and colorful mirroring effect. The water is a clear, light blue, mirroring the sky above. In the background across the lake, there are more trees and a hazy, light blue mountain range under a pale blue sky. The lighting is soft and natural, suggesting a bright and clear day. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and picturesque, highlighting the beauty of the blooming season.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n- Pink blooming trees with small, dense flowers\n- Dark brown tree trunks\n- Green grass and manicured bushes along an embankment\n- Serene lake with clear water\n- Reflections of trees and blossoms on the water\n- Distant treeline and hazy mountains\n- Pale blue sky\n\n**Style:**\nNaturalistic, realistic, high-definition, tranquil, picturesque\n\n**Composition:**\n- A row of blooming trees extends from the left to the right, forming a natural leading line.\n- The lake occupies the lower half of the image, with the reflections creating a strong vertical symmetry.\n- The horizon line where the lake meets the distant land/mountains is roughly in the middle, creating a balanced composition.\n- The vibrant pink of the blossoms is a dominant visual element against the light blues and greens.\n\n**Colors:**\n- Dominant bright pink (for blossoms)\n- Various shades of green (foliage, grass)\n- Dark brown (tree trunks)\n- Light blue, pale blue (sky, water, distant mountains)\n- Subtle white for highlights and light reflections.\n\n**Lighting:**\nSoft, natural daylight, even illumination, bright and clear.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nPeaceful, serene, beautiful, vibrant, calming, fresh.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Ripples morph reflections of swaying blossoms. Petals drift, scattering across the water. Camera glides rightward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The lake's surface violently convulses, trees thrashing their pink blossoms into a furious storm of petals that whip across the water. Reflections explode into chaotic abstract patterns, reforming in jagged, unsettling lines as the water churns and boils. A sudden, violent gust rips through the scene, shredding petals and branches, as the entire scene careens rightwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Pink blossoms erupt from the water, their reflections now solid trees rising into the air, slowly drawing their own original forms back down from the sky. Petals fall *up* into the branches, reversing their bloom. The camera drifts right as the scene mirrors, then inverts, revealing sky below a watery canopy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A gentle, cinematic zoom-out reveals a panoramic vista of the lake, with the vibrant pink blossoms reflected in the water. A sudden gust of wind whips through the trees, creating a dramatic cascade of petals onto the water. The camera glides forward, following a single petal as it dances on the ripples, until it merges into the larger, beautiful reflection.",
