    "video_prompt": "Subtle flicker and glow in the city lights within the eye, with light trails along the roads gently pulsing. The intricate spokes and hairs around the eye could have a very subtle, almost imperceptible vibrate.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed and stylized close-up shot of a cyborg fly's compound eye, which functions as a curved, reflective screen displaying a futuristic neon cityscape at dusk. The fly's body is dark blue and metallic, with intricate gold and bronze screw-like details and fine, antenna-like black hairs protruding from its head. The large circular eye is framed by similar metallic detailing and spiky lashes.\n\nInside the eye, the cityscape is vibrant with glowing purple and blue streaks of light representing busy roadways, resembling light trails from fast-moving vehicles. Tall, illuminated skyscrapers dominate the skyline, with several futuristic flying vehicles, or aeroplanes, visible against the twilight sky. The reflection on the eye shows subtle light glares. Below the eye, two brown, textured, tentacle-like structures extend, possibly part of its mouthparts. Part of a metallic blue leg with spiky, hair-like textures is visible in the lower left foreground.\n\nThe overall style is a blend of steampunk and futuristic sci-fi, rendered with hyper-realistic detail. The lighting is dramatic, with the bright city lights contrasting against the darker metallic body. The atmosphere is one of technological wonder and intricate design. A \"c29\" watermark is subtly present in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "City lights subtly flicker and glow within the eye. Light trails pulse gently down roads. Intricate spokes and hairs around the eye vibrate imperceptibly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Exploding eyes glow with an aggressive, pulsating city. Hyper-speed light trails rip across roads, buildings abruptly lurch, aircraft become sentient, diving and weaving. The metallic exoskeleton shatters and reforms, bristles flash like lightning, then extend as razor-sharp tendrils, grasping and tearing at the air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A bioluminescent cityscape within the fly's eye pulsates, light trails on roads slither like sentient serpents. As light intensifies, buildings phase shift into shimmering liquid, flowing upwards defying gravity. Tiny gears and hairs around the eye ripple and stretch, revealing cosmic vistas within their new form, before contracting back into their impossible design.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow-motion push-in on the fly's eye, as subtle light pulses reveal shimmering urban roadways within. As the camera glides around the eye, the futuristic cityscape inside slowly rotates, revealing soaring flying vehicles catching the light. A swift, close-up tilt then reveals the intricate mechanical hairs and bolts, each vibrating almost imperceptibly, hinting at hidden technology within the creature, before pulling back to a stark, wide shot, emphasizing the mysterious nature of the \"c29\" entity.",
