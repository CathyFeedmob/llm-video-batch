    "video_prompt": "Subtle glints of light reflecting off the pepper's skin and the car windows. The tiny house lights subtly flicker. Slight, almost imperceptible swaying of the miniature trees.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that could recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A highly detailed and surreal cross-section of a vibrant red bell pepper, standing upright on a reflective white surface. Inside the hollowed bell pepper, a miniature, winding asphalt road with white dashed lines serpentines through a lush green landscape. Along the roadside are typical suburban houses with glowing yellow window lights, small green trees, and meticulously manicured lawns. Several miniature white cars are visible on the road. Playful, stylized animals like foxes and sheep are scattered across the green areas. The interior walls of the pepper show realistic textures of the fruit's flesh. The pepper's stem is a rich green, curving naturally upwards.\n\n**Style:** Photorealistic, surreal, miniature diorama, whimsical.\n**Composition:** Vertical orientation, full shot of the pepper, the winding road leading the eye upwards, generous negative space around the pepper.\n**Colors:** Dominant bright reds and greens, accents of white (cars, houses, background), yellow (house lights), and black (road).\n**Lighting:** Soft, even studio lighting from above, creating subtle reflections on the pepper and the surface below. No harsh shadows. Bright and airy atmosphere.\n**Atmosphere:** Inviting, miniature world, clean, fantasy-like.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Pepper's skin subtly glints, car windows reflect shifting light. Tiny house lights gently flicker. Miniature trees imperceptibly sway.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal pepper violently quakes, its skin rippling like a tidal wave. Jagged teeth tear through its fleshy interior as the miniature homes abruptly lift, rotating erratically, their windows exploding with light. Cars hurtle off the spiraling road, defying gravity, as trees thrash like maddened whips, roots clawing the air. Blazing streaks of light erupt from the pepper's depths, convulsing it further.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The pepper's skin undulates, its reflections shimmering and dancing independently. Car windows melt into liquid light, flowing up the winding road as houses softly inflate and deflate like breathing organisms. Trees stretch and shrink with impossible elasticity, their leaves phasing through various hues. The entire scene subtly breathes, as if the landscape itself is a living entity, defying all sense of scale and solidity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Slow, deliberate pan across the pepper's sleek, ruby skin, catching subtle glints as it reveals the miniature world within. A dramatic zoom-in follows a car winding down the road, its headlights cutting through the tiny twilight. The camera then gracefully swoops over the miniature homes, their windows softly glowing, as the minuscule trees subtly sway, casting dancing shadows. The entire scene pulsates with a quiet, vibrant life.",
