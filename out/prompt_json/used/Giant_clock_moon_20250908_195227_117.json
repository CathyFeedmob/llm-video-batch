    "video_prompt": "A large clock, resembling a massive pocket watch, hangs in the sky, with water pouring downwards from its base creating two glowing waterfalls towards the viewer. The moon is prominently visible in the sky above the clock. The scene is set in a cobblestone street, lined by tall, old buildings with warm lights emanating from their windows. People dressed in dark attire walk along the street, but a woman in a long flowing skirt with a red umbrella walks towards the viewer in the rain.\n\nThe prompt should animate the water pouring from the clock, the woman's skirt moving subtly from the wind, the people moving, the water on the ground reflecting light and rippling slightly, and light on the street flickering. A slow, subtle camera pull-out and slight pan, revealing more of the street and the clock as it moves diagonally to the right.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the image:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA surreal street scene dominated by a gigantic, intricate, antique pocket watch floating high in the sky. Behind the watch is an oversized, luminous full moon with visible craters. Water streams down from the bottom of the clock face, cascading into the street below like multiple thin waterfalls. The street is wet and reflective, appearing to be after rain. On either side of the street are tall, narrow, old European-style buildings with multiple windows and some ornate detailing, including pointed spires on distant buildings. Silhouetted figures of people walk on the wet pavement, some with their backs to the viewer. One central figure in the foreground, seen from behind, walks away from the viewer holding a red umbrella. Street lamps with warm, glowing light line the pavement, casting reflections on the wet ground.\n\n**Style:**\nSurreal, fantastical, dreamlike, cinematic, magical realism, highly detailed, slightly painterly, ethereal.\n\n**Composition:**\nVertical orientation. The giant clock and moon are centrally placed in the upper half. The street forms a strong leading line, drawing the eye towards the vanishing point in the mid-ground. The central figure with the red umbrella creates a focal point in the foreground. The street lamps provide rhythmic elements along the sides.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant cool blues and teals in the sky and moon, contrasting with warm oranges and yellows from the street lamps and building windows. The water streams are bright white/light blue. The buildings are in shades of dark brown, brick red, and grey. The red umbrella pops as a highlight color.\n\n**Lighting:**\nEthereal and dramatic. The giant moon casts a soft, widespread glow on the sky and clouds. The water streams are brightly illuminated from an unseen source above, possibly the moon or an internal light from the clock. The street lamps provide strong, localized warm light that reflects intensely off the wet pavement. Subtle backlighting on the central figures.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nMysterious, whimsical, perhaps slightly melancholic or contemplative, serene yet imaginative. A sense of wonder and otherworldliness.\n\n**Concise Prompt:**\n\"A surreal cityscape at twilight, with a colossal, antique pocket watch floating centrally in the sky, cascading multiple glowing water streams onto a wet street below. A gigantic, luminous full moon with visible craters is positioned behind the clock. Old European-style buildings with pointed spires line the reflective, rain-slicked street. Silhouetted figures walk, one central person holding a red umbrella in the foreground. Warm glowing street lamps illuminate the pavement. Dreamlike, cinematic, highly detailed, cool blues and teals contrasting with warm oranges and reds, ethereal lighting.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Cascading water streams from the colossal clock, its glowing falls shimmer. The woman's skirt subtly billows as she strides forward, her red umbrella swaying. Figures drift along the street. Puddles ripple, catching flickering streetlights. A deliberate, gentle camera pull-out and diagonal pan unveils more of the dynamic streetscape and the majestic clock.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**AGGRO-PROMPT:** Clock explodes, unleashing a torrent of black water that defies gravity, sucking the moon into its churning vortex. Buildings contort, their windows shattering into fiery shards as the street splits open, revealing molten earth. People are ripped skyward, their forms dissolving into shimmering light. The womanâ€™s umbrella flares into an inferno, propelling her into the chaotic void. The camera violently whips, plunging into the maelstrom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A large clock morphs into a celestial vortex, pulling the moon and stars into its face as time splinters. Waterfalls defy gravity, coalescing upwards, dissolving into spectral light. The woman's umbrella becomes a beacon, her skirt a swirling nebula, as the street warps and stretches, buildings breathing with pulsing light. People ripple and shimmer, their forms echoing the liquid ground, as the camera spirals inward, dissolving into the impossible.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide shot reveals a dramatic, moonlit street. The massive clock pulsates, its water streams intensifying, now glowing with an ethereal blue. The camera slowly pushes in on the woman in the red umbrella, her skirt dramatically swaying as she halts, turning slowly to gaze directly at the cascading waters. The streetlights flicker erratically while the camera subtly pivots to highlight the moon, then rapidly tilts down to the glistening, rippling wet ground. A gust of wind causes people to brace themselves, their reflections momentarily fracturing in the puddles.",
