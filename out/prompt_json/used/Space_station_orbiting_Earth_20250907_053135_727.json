Several tiny spacecraft emerge from the large structure's hangar, moving into the vastness of space. The lights on the large structure and the upper cylindrical buildings subtly twinkle and shift in brightness.

    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Overall Scene:**\nA futuristic space station or mega-structure in orbit above a vibrant blue planet, with numerous spacecraft flying around it and in the atmosphere. The scene is set in deep space, featuring stars and distant celestial bodies.\n\n**Composition:**\nThe image is a vertical shot with a dynamic, slightly upward-looking perspective. The massive space station dominates the left and center of the frame, extending towards the bottom and right. Its complex architecture creates strong diagonal and horizontal lines, leading the eye across the structure. The planet's horizon is visible in the middle-right, dipping towards the bottom. Several spacecraft are strategically placed to create depth and movement: a large one flying away in the upper right, smaller ones in the distance, and others near the station at various levels, some appearing to be docked or approaching.\n\n**Space Station/Structure:**\n*   **Architecture:** Intricately detailed, multi-layered, and sprawling. It features cylindrical and rectilinear modules, connecting bridges, and numerous protrusions like antennas and towers.\n*   **Color Palette:** Primarily uses muted and desaturated tones of steel blue, teal, and dark grey for the main body, contrasted sharply with prominent sections of warm reddish-orange and light beige/off-white. Small accents of bright blue light are visible in windows and internal sections.\n*   **Details:** Visible windows, docking bays, vents, complex paneling, and structural supports. Some sections appear to be glowing from within. One prominent circular platform with a reddish-orange roof and visible interior lights is a key feature in the mid-ground, overlooking the planet.\n\n**Spacecraft:**\n*   **Variation:** A variety of spacecraft are depicted, ranging from large, robust vessels with visible thrusters to smaller, sleeker ones.\n*   **Design:** Generally rectilinear or oblong shapes with visible engines, fins, and lights.\n*   **Colors:** Similar to the station, featuring tones of grey, off-white, and orange/red.\n*   **Effects:** Thruster plumes are a striking visual element, depicted as bright, segmented beams of light (electric blue/white) extending behind the ships, adding a sense of motion and power.\n\n**Celestial Bodies & Background:**\n*   **Planet:** A realistic-looking exoplanet with a distinct blue ocean and white cloud formations, seen from orbit.\n*   **Deep Space:** Pitch black with numerous scattered stars of varying brightness.\n*   **Distant Orbs:** Several smaller, glowing spherical objects appear in the far distance in the upper-right, resembling artificial moons or planets, with light beams originating from them, possibly indicating highly advanced technology or terraforming.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Source:** Diffuse but strong light from an unseen celestial body (likely the sun), casting distinct shadows and highlighting edges. The top and left sides of the station are brighter, suggesting the light source is from the upper left.\n*   **Glow:** Internal lighting within the station and glowing elements on spacecraft create a warm, technological glow against the dark of space.\n*   **Contrast:** High contrast between the brightly lit station and spacecraft and the dark void of space, making the structures stand out.\n*   **Atmosphere:** The planet's atmosphere is a vibrant blue, fading slightly into the darkness of space at the horizon.\n\n**Art Style:**\n*   **Inspired by Moebius/Syd Mead:** Distinctive, clean line art with sharp edges and clear separation of colors, reminiscent of classic sci-fi comic book or concept art.\n*   **Textural Quality:** While clean, there's a subtle texture or ink wash quality to the coloring, giving it depth without being overly rendered.\n*   **Futuristic Realism:** Blends imaginative futuristic elements with a grounded, believable feel.\n\n**Prompt Keywords:**\nfuturistic space station, orbital structure, mega-structure, detailed architecture, spacecraft, starships, planet Earth (or exoplanet), deep space, stars, blue ocean planet, white clouds, thruster plumes, glowing objects, science fiction art, comic book style, Moebius inspired, Syd Mead influence, high contrast, vibrant colors, steel blue, teal, reddish-orange, beige, dramatic lighting, upward view, vertical composition, intricate details, technological glow.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Distant spaceships approach, engine trails stretching. Tiny spacecraft emerge from the hangar, moving into space. Structure and building lights twinkle, shifting brightness. Atmospheric haze wafts across the distant planet.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Distant spaceships hurtle forward, their blue engine trails violently whip and surge. Tiny spacecraft burst from the hangar, their forms wildly contorting as they rocket into space. Lights on the structure and cylindrical buildings intensely flicker, exploding and reforming. Atmospheric haze wildly spins and churns around the planet, its surface rippling intensely. The massive structure abruptly twists, its immense form shuddering and then snapping into a new orientation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The distant spaceships gradually approach, their blue engine trails subtly stretching and then curling back into themselves, pulling the ships backward into the void. Several tiny spacecraft emerge from the large structure's hangar, twisting inside out as they sprout wings of pure light, their forms impossibly folding and unfolding in mid-flight. The lights on the large structure and the upper cylindrical buildings subtly twinkle and shift in brightness, not flickering but dissolving into swirling vortexes that re-coalesce elsewhere on the surface. A faint, almost imperceptible atmospheric haze gently wafts across the distant blue planet, but instead of diffusing, it crystallizes into geometric shapes that float and then shatter into stardust.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide shot reveals a colossal futuristic space station, bathed in the soft glow of distant nebulae. Spaceships, their blue engine trails vivid, glide gracefully towards the station. A dramatic zoom-in highlights a hangar opening, and small craft emerge, their movements fluid and dynamic as they navigate the void. The camera sweeps across the station's illuminated structures, light subtly flickering, then pans down to the hazy blue planet below, enhancing the sense of scale and awe.",
