    "video_prompt": "Short, gentle rain falling, drops hitting the floor and pooling slightly. Hair slightly sways and drips water. Her chest subtly rises and falls with breathing. Water glistens on her skin and soaks through her clothes. A gentle breeze causes the blue fabric hanging on the bunk bed to sway.",
    "image_prompt": "A young woman with long, wet, wavy purple hair and fair skin stands in the foreground, looking distressed and looking up, slightly to the right, with her right hand raking through her hair. She is wearing a wet, translucent white t-shirt and grey athletic shorts. Water droplets cling to her skin and clothes, indicating she has been in the rain. In her left arm, she holds a white garment. The setting is an indoor space with a concrete floor and walls, resembling a room with bunk beds on the left and right sides. The lighting is dim with soft, diffuse light coming from the left, highlighting the falling rain. The overall atmosphere is melancholic and introspective. A water bottle and sneakers are visible on the floor to the left, and an ID badge hangs from the bunk bed on the right. The image uses a full body shot, allowing the entire figure and surrounding elements to be seen. The style is realistic and vivid, with natural colors and textures.\n\n**Visual elements:**\n* **Subject:** Young woman, fair skin, purple, wavy, long hair (wet).\n* **Clothing:** Wet, translucent white t-shirt, grey athletic shorts.\n* **Objects:** White garment held in hand, water bottle, sneakers, ID badge.\n* **Setting:** Indoor room with concrete floor and walls, bunk beds.\n* **Action:** Woman standing, looking up, hand in hair, holding garment.\n* **Weather/Effect:** Rain falling, subject wet.\n\n**Composition:** Full body shot, subject in foreground, bunk beds in background.

    "refined_video_prompt": "**Focus on Movement & Change:**\n\nRaindrops actively impacting surfaces, forming small, expanding puddles. Hair exhibiting subtle, water-driven swaying and dripping. Thoracic movement from natural respiration. Skin glistening and clothes darkening due to saturation. Blue fabric demonstrating gentle, wind-induced undulations.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Torrential downpour violently lashes the room, water cascading from crumbling ceilings, shattering on the concrete. Her drenched hair wildly whips and lashes, streams of water exploding from every strand. Her chest heaves **violently**, clothes tearing from the force. The previously static bunk beds heave and crash, metal bending, the blue fabric ripping and thrashing like a frantic entity. Water defies gravity, defying the laws of physics, erupting upward in furious geysers, then violently crashing back down. Every drop detonates on impact, sending shrapnel of water everywhere. The ground itself shakes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Raindrops, impossibly solid, ascend from the puddles, forming crystalline structures that sprout branches and bloom into miniature, shimmering galaxies. Her hair, infused with starlight, unfurls like nebulae, each strand tracing a unique spiral as it defies gravity, drawing water from the floorboards which then reform upwards. Her chest, a pulsating cosmos, exhales shimmering smoke as the bunk bed's blue fabric, now liquid, flows off the bed and reforms mid-air into a flock of iridescent birds.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A close-up reveals the woman's face, her eyes wide, as rain cascades around her. The camera slowly pans down her body, revealing her soaked clothes clinging to her skin. Her hand rises dramatically to adjust her soaked hair, water dripping down her arm as the camera slowly pulls back, revealing the stark bunk beds behind her. As the camera pans down, the blue fabric on the bunk bed sways, reflecting the subtle breeze, and hinting at movement within the confined space.",
