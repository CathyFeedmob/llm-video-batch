    "video_prompt": "Hair subtly sways with very minor breeze, skirt gently sways as if in motion. Faint dust motes drift in the sunlight.  The girl's head bobs slightly as she runs, and her eyes blink occasionally.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**(Masterpiece, best quality, high resolution, detailed, anime aesthetic)**\n\n**Subject:** A young, energetic female character, likely a high school student, with long, flowing dark hair and bright, expressive eyes. She is smiling broadly and appears mid-step, perhaps running or jumping.\n\n**Clothing:** She wears a short-sleeved white crop top, a black pleated mini skirt, and black Mary Jane-style shoes. A dark shoulder bag is slung across her body. Her left wrist has multiple bracelets.\n\n**Pose & Action:** Her body is angled, suggesting forward movement. Her left arm is extended forward, palm down, as if she's pushing off a surface or balancing. Her right arm is bent at the elbow, and her body is slightly leaning. Her hair is dramatically swept back, emphasizing motion.\n\n**Setting:** An outdoor, sun-drenched pathway or street in what appears to be an urban or suburban Japanese setting. To her left is a textured, moss-covered concrete wall with a white banner attached, featuring large black Japanese characters. Behind the wall are green shrubs and a wooden fence. To her right, in the background, are lush green trees and traditional Japanese architecture (e.g., a dark wooden gate or structure).\n\n**Composition:** Medium full body shot from a low-angle perspective, emphasizing her dynamic pose and the height of the wall. The camera is slightly tilted to enhance the sense of movement and energy. The character is positioned centrally but leaning into the frame.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:** Bright, clear daylight with strong sun reflection off the ground and highlights on the character's hair and clothes. There are distinct shadows being cast, indicating a strong light source from above and slightly behind the viewer. Small, faint white particles (possibly dust or petals) are scattered in the air, adding to a serene or magical atmosphere. The overall mood is cheerful, energetic, and bright.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by blues (sky), greens (foliage, moss), white (shirt, banner, light reflections), and blacks/grays (skirt, hair, shoes, wall). Skin tones are natural and warm.\n\n**Art Style:** Anime illustration style, characterized by clean lines, vibrant colors, attention to character expression, and dynamic poses. Realistic lighting and shading are applied to an otherwise stylized subject.\n\n**Signatures/Text:** Faint white text \"C29\" horizontally near the lower right corner, and \"AI 生成\" (AI Generation) in the top left corner of the sky.\n\n**(Optional details for even higher fidelity):**\n- Subtle depth of field, with the character sharp and the background softly blurred.\n- Textured elements on the wall, clothing, and hair.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Hair sways gently. Skirt flows softly. Dust motes drift lazily. Head bobs rhythmically. Eyes blink infrequently.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Girl hurtles through the air, hair thrashing violently, skirt ripped by unseen forces. Concrete wall explodes into shards as she slams against it, leaving a crater. Dust motes erupt into miniature tornadoes. Her eyes glow ominously, the world distorting around her in a whirlwind of chaotic energy. Buildings melt and reform, water spouts spiral upward, defying gravity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The girl's hair undulates like liquid shadows, defying wind, while her skirt ripples with internal light. Sunlight reverses, pulling dust motes back into the sky. Her head rotates instead of bobbing, observing impossible angles, and individual eyes detach and re-orbit her face, blinking independently through swirling colors that bleed from the environment.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Camera: Dynamic handheld, following energy.**\n\n**(0-2s) Extreme Close-up:** Wind whips raven hair across the girl's determined face, a glint in her eye. Sunlight flares.\n\n**(2-4s) Quick Pan & Tilt:** Camera swoops down from her face, catching her arm outstretched against the mossy wall, then pivots dramatically as she propels herself forward.\n\n**(4-6s) Full Body Tracking Shot:** Skirt flares wildly as she leaps, a burst of cinematic light catching her mid-air. Dust motes explode around her.\n\n**(6-8s) Crane Shot, Arc:** Soaring overhead, camera arcs as she races past the ancient wall, sunlight dappling the path.\n\n**(8-10s) Quick Zoom-Out:** Reveals her running into the distance, a small, yet powerful figure against the vibrant backdrop.",
