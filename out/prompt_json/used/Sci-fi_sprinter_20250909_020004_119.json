    "video_prompt": "The figure subtly shifts its weight, armored panels softly clicking with the movement. Sparks gently drift upwards from the grimy foreground, catching the faint blue-white light from the distant city structures. Subtle glints of light traverse the character’s red and black armor. The long, thin appendages on the figure's back subtly flex and retract.",
    "image_prompt": "a highly detailed full-body shot of a futuristic female mercenary in a dynamic pose, dressed in a sleek red and dark grey armored suit with glowing teal accents, resembling a spider-like design due to multiple leg-like appendages emerging from her back. The character is in a running or lunging posture, with one leg bent forward and the other extended backward, hands slightly open as if bracing for impact or movement. The background is a dark, sprawling futuristic city with tall, illuminated structures and subtle blue lighting, suggesting a nighttime or indoor environment. Sparks and embers float in the foreground and midground, indicating action or destruction. The lighting is dramatic, with bright highlights on the character's armor reflecting the background light, creating a sense of energetic movement and urgency. The style is hyper-realistic and sci-fi art, with a focus on metallic textures and intricate details on the suit. The overall atmosphere is intense and action-oriented.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nThe figure subtly shifts weight, causing soft clicks from armored panels. Sparks drift upwards from the foreground, catching faint blue-white light from distant city structures. Subtle light glints traverse the red and black armor. Long, thin appendages on the back subtly flex and retract.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The armored figure EXPLODES into action, metallic limbs CRASHING down as it launches into a mid-air dash. The city structures behind it violently SHIFT and CONVERGE, their lights SCATTERING like shrapnel. Sparks on the ground ERUPT into a furious dance, morphing into tendrils of pure energy, actively CHASING the figure. The appendages on its back WHIP and STRIKE, coiling like predatory serpents.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The armored figure strides, defying gravity as it levitates, each step pushing sparks upwards into impossible inversions. Its red and black suit shimmers, its sleek surfaces transforming into molten gold before recomposing. The appendages on its back writhe, extending infinitely, phasing through solid objects, bending light into distorted echoes. The cityscape spirals, structures blurring then reshaping into abstract forms, as the figure's movements ripple through dimensions, creating ever-shifting, impossible pathways in its wake.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, low to the ground, dramatically tracks forward alongside the sprinting armored figure. As the figure shifts its weight, armored panels flare with bright red light, catching the sparks erupting from the grimy foreground. The camera sweeps to a close-up, focusing on the flexing, predatory appendages on its back before pulling back to reveal the figure leaping into the air, silhouetted against the blinding light of the distant city, its form becoming a dynamic blur.",
