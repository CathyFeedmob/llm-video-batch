    "video_prompt": "A subtle forward camera push creates a sense of motion. The motorcycle's tail lights pulse gently. Small dust or light particles drift in the air, especially in the brighter distant light. The pink and teal light streaks subtly waver and flicker, emphasizing speed.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-contrast, cyberpunk-inspired image of a person riding a sleek sport motorcycle at high speed through a futuristic illuminated urban tunnel.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** A person in full black motorcycle gear (helmet, jacket, pants, boots) on a modern sport motorcycle. The motorcycle has sharp lines and a glowing red taillight.\n*   **Setting:** A narrow, high-speed urban tunnel with motion blur, creating a sense of extreme speed. The tunnel is flanked by stylized, dark city buildings.\n*   **Sky/Background:** Above the city architecture, a cosmic sky with multiple celestial bodies resembling moons or planets with rings, and scattered stars.\n*   **Motion:** Streaks of light and motion blur from the motorcycle and the background indicate rapid movement.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Art Style:** Digital illustration with a strong graphic novel/comic book aesthetic. Clean lines, a degree of stylized abstraction, and vibrant color usage.\n*   **Genre:** Cyberpunk, sci-fi, futuristic.\n*   **Brush Strokes:** Apparent, giving a painted yet digital feel.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Angle:** Low angle, looking up slightly at the rider and the tunnel, enhancing the speed and dramatic effect.\n*   **Perspective:** Dynamic one-point perspective with the vanishing point at the bright end of the tunnel, drawing the viewer's eye forward.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The rider and motorcycle are positioned roughly in the lower right third, providing balance and leading the eye.\n*   **Depth:** Strong sense of depth created by the receding tunnel, the layers of cityscape, and the distant planets.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Primary Palette:** Dominant cool tones of teal, dark blue, and black, contrasted sharply with vibrant neon pink/magenta and bright white.\n*   **Highlights:** Neon pink/magenta used for light streaks, some building accents, and the motorcycle's taillight.\n*   **Lighting:** Strong light source at the tunnel's end creating a bright glow and reflections.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Intense, fast-paced, futuristic, and slightly mysterious due to the dark tones and cosmic elements.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Backlighting from the tunnel's end, creating a silhouette effect on parts of the rider and motorcycle.\n*   Neon light streaks casting glows.\n*   Subtle ambient light on the planets.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Evokes excitement, speed, and a sense of journey into a vast, advanced, and neon-lit future.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera glides forward. Tail lights pulsate. Dust particles drift subtly, catching light. Light streaks waver and flicker dynamically.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The biker's helmet violently snaps toward an unseen threat. The motorcycle's tail lights blaze with an explosive surge, propelling it forward in an impossible lurch. Pink and teal light streaks erupt into chaotic, whipping tendrils, shattering the air. Buildings warp and convulse around the speeding bike, their forms twisting under the sheer velocity, as distant lights implode into blinding white shockwaves.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The rider's shadow detaches, becoming a sentient, glowing entity that races ahead, pulling the bike through a collapsing tunnel of inverted galaxies. Pink light solidifies into crystal shards, shattering reality into reflective planes where parallel dimensions flicker. Teal streaks become liquid sound, reforming into impossible instruments playing silent melodies as the bike phases through non-Euclidean cityscapes, the celestial bodies above morphing into pulsating eyes that invert gravitational pull towards an ethereal void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sleek, cinematic crane shot descends, revealing a lone motorcyclist carving through a neon-streaked cyberpunk city. The camera sharply pushes forward, blurring the luminous road. Dramatic light flickers off the rider's helmet as they lean into a turn. Planets loom large in the distant, starry sky, their rings subtly glinting, adding cosmic scale to the rider's journey.",
