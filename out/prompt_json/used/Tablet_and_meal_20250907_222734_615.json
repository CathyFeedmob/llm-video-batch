    "video_prompt": "Flickering light from the tablet screen gently illuminates the scene. Slight steam rises from the hot food, particularly the rice and soup. The liquid in the drink glass subtly shimmers with the ice occasionally shifting. A very subtle, slow zoom out reveals more of the tabletop.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, detailed illustration featuring a top-down view of a wooden table laden with a delicious meal. In the upper part of the image, an iPad on a stand displays an animated scene of three characters (resembling Shinnosuke \"Shin-chan\" Nohara from Crayon Shin-chan) cooking in a kitchen. The tablet screen fills the upper portion of the scene, showing one character stirring a pot on a stove, another preparing a plate of green peas, and a third looking towards the viewer. The kitchen background on the tablet includes a range hood, cabinets, and a window. To the left of the iPad, a potted green plant with broad leaves sits on the table.\n\nBelow the iPad, a wooden serving tray holds four dishes and a glass of beverage. From left to right on the tray: a white plate with sliced beef covered in a dark sauce, adorned with green herbs and red chili peppers; a light blue bowl filled with white rice topped with sesame seeds and golden crispy grains; a light blue bowl containing corn on the cob cut into pieces and white cubes (possibly tofu or turnip); and a white bowl of clear soup with chunks of meat (possibly pork ribs), sliced carrots, and white potato or turnip pieces. To the right of the tray, a tall glass filled with an orange beverage and ice cubes stands on a checkered coaster. A small cartoon character (again, resembling Shin-chan) is depicted on the side of the glass. The table has a wood grain texture. The overall style is reminiscent of clean, bright, and detailed cartoon animation. A subtle watermark \"c29\" is in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Gentle screen light flickers. Steam subtly rises from hot food. Ice shifts and liquid shimmers in the drink. A very slow, subtle zoom out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**IMPACT FADE-OUT:** Tablet screen EXPLODES with light, fiery characters LEAPING from the display! Table SPLITS, food BOWLS violently SHATTER, liquid geysers ERUPT from the drink! Rice grains SCATTER like shrapnel, soup bones JUT from the bowl, all propelled by a SHOCKWAVE. Utensils WHIRL into a vortex. The entire scene RUPTURES, then BLACKS OUT in a blinding flash.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The tablet projection twists into a swirling vortex, consuming the food. Rice grains ascend, forming constellations that ignite into miniature stars before imploding into tiny black holes. The soup's steam condenses into solid ice cubes that float upwards, transforming into shimmering butterflies before dissolving into iridescent mist. The drink glass melts downwards into the wooden table, becoming a liquid reflection of the animated cooking scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The tablet's screen pulsates with a soft, flickering glow, mimicking a hearth. A slow, cinematic zoom out reveals a vast, wooden table spread. Steam delicately curls from the soup and rice, their essences almost tangible. The ice in the amber drink clinks softly, each shift resonating like a miniature gong. As the camera retreats, a playful gust of wind rustles the plant's leaves, causing them to dance subtly as if applauding the culinary symphony. The entire scene is bathed in the tablet's gentle, rhythmic light, creating an intimate, almost dreamlike portrayal of domestic comfort.",
