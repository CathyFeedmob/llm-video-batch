    "video_prompt": "Subtle light flickering within the bases of the structures, with a gentle, slow shimmer effect on the blue energy beams extending upwards. Wisps of fog or clouds around the base of the structures and among the distant mountains slowly drift. Faint twinkling of distant stars. A very slow, almost imperceptible zoom out or push in of the camera.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nfuturistic alien landscape with numerous towering, sleek grey and black sci-fi structures emitting brilliant, luminous blue energy beams upwards into the dark, star-filled sky. Each structure has a circular base glowing with intricate bright blue light patterns and small orange accents, casting a soft ethereal glow on the rocky, desolate terrain below. Wisps of mysterious, light grey clouds or low-lying mist drift across the ground between the structures. In the midground, a large, detailed moon or planet with visible craters and grey and white tones is prominent against the dark sky. The overall lighting is dramatic and back-lit by the intense blue energy, creating strong shadows and highlights on the structures and ground. The atmosphere is awe-inspiring and slightly ominous, with a sense of advanced technology on an otherworldly scale. There is a sense of depth with multiple rows of structures receding into the distance, becoming smaller and less defined. The style is hyperrealistic and highly detailed, with sharp focus on the foreground elements.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Futuristic alien landscape, towering sci-fi structures.\n*   **Key Visual Elements:**\n    *   **Structures:** Numerous, sleek, grey/black, hexagonal or cylindrical design, emitting blue energy beams. Circular, glowing bases with intricate patterns and orange accents.\n    *   **Energy Beams:** Brilliant, luminous blue, extending vertically into the sky, some with wispy/plasma effects.\n    *   **Terrain:** Rocky, desolate, brownish-grey, with visible textures.\n    *   **Clouds/Mist:** Wispy, light grey, low-lying, ethereal, drifting between structures.\n    *   **Celestial Body:** Large moon/planet (grey/white, visible craters) in the midground sky.\n    *   **Sky:** Dark, filled with numerous small stars.\n*   **Style:** Hyperrealistic, highly detailed, sci-fi, futuristic.\n*   **Composition:**\n    *   **Depth:** Multiple rows of structures receding into the distance, smaller elements in the background for depth.\n    *   **Rule of Thirds/Leading Lines:** Structures act as leading lines directing the eye upwards and towards the horizon.\n    *   **Framing:** The structures naturally frame the large celestial body.\n    *   **Symmetry/Repetition:** Repetition of structure design creates a sense of order and scale.\n*   **Colors:** Predominantly dark blues, black, greys, with bright luminous blue for energy, and subtle orange accents; muted browns/greys for terrain.\n*   **Lighting:**\n    *   Dramatic and high contrast.\n    *   Strong light source from the blue energy beams themselves (emissive lighting).\n    *   Back-lighting effect created by the intense blue glow.\n    *   Casting strong shadows from the structures onto the terrain.\n    *   Subtle atmospheric glow around the glowing bases.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Awe-inspiring, futuristic, powerful, slightly mysterious, otherworldly, grand scale.\n*   **Rendering Details:** Sharp focus on foreground and midground, detailed textures on structures and terrain.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle light flickering at structure bases, gently shimmering blue energy beams extending upwards. Wisps of fog drift around bases and distant mountains. Faint stars twinkle. Very slow, almost imperceptible camera zoom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Sudden, violent bursts of energy erupt from the structures' bases, sending blinding flashes upwards. The blue energy beams contort and lash wildly, accompanied by crackling electricity that sparks and jumps between them. The ground around the structures fissures and shifts violently. Distant mountains collapse, and the entire landscape writhes and transforms with seismic force. The camera performs a dizzying, uncontrolled rapid zoom and quick, jarring tilts.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Impossible prompt:\n\nGravity inverts, pulling structures upwards as energy beams solidify, then melt into liquid light. Mountains undulate, breathing clouds like smoke. Stars kaleidoscope into swirling nebulae. Blue light from bases unfurls into spectral wings, carrying the structures on an upward migration. Dimensions subtly compress, then expand, revealing infinite, mirrored realities.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, positioned low, slowly pushes in, revealing a desolate landscape punctuated by colossal, glowing structures. As it glides closer, a subtle light flickers within their bases, pulsating with blue energy beams that shimmer upwards. Wisps of fog and clouds drift languidly around the bases and distant mountains, creating an eerie, ethereal atmosphere. The camera then smoothly dollies left, revealing a colossal moon rising into view as stars faintly twinkle. The scene culminates in a slow, dramatic tilt up as the camera orbits, showcasing the towering structures in their full grandeur.",
