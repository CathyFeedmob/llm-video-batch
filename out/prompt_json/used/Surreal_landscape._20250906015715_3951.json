  "video_prompt": "Golden liquid pours from above, creating ripples and splashes on a chocolate-like surface. Miniature figures navigate floating biscuit rafts, wading through the brown fluid, and interacting with the falling golden rain. Sparkling white material around the edges shimmers.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a whimsical, surreal landscape where a giant golden liquid (caramel/honey) pours from a light blue sky onto a reflective reddish-brown liquid (chocolate syrup) below. Scattered across the chocolate are biscuit islands, navigated by miniature human figures. The scene is framed by sparkling white, fluffy material (cotton candy/coconut/sugar) and illuminated by bright, sunny light, evoking miniature wonder.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Golden liquid streams down, generating expanding ripples and energetic splashes across the dark, viscous surface. Miniature figures actively navigate their floating biscuit rafts, wading purposefully through the brown fluid as it gently flows, and expressively interacting with the descending golden rain. Shimmering white material subtly shifts and glitters along the edges."
