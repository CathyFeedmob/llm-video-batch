    "video_prompt": "A joyful chef hedgehog meticulously *arranges* and *ties* vibrant green culinary rolls, its expressive face *beaming* with focused delight. Rosy cheeks *flush* subtly, and eyes *sparkle* with eager anticipation. In the cozy kitchen, fairy lights *twinkle* softly, casting a *pulsing glow*. A pot on the counter *gently steams*, while outside the window, a soft purple light *subtly shifts*, enhancing the enchanting atmosphere.",
    "image_prompt": "An adorable, cartoon-style anthropomorphic hedgehog chef, with brown fur and striking dark brown and white quills, wears a puffy white chef's hat, a cream apron with red strawberry patterns, and a dark blue long-sleeved shirt. Its joyful, expressive face with large dark eyes and a wide smile focuses on delicately arranging a pyramid stack of vibrant green cylindrical rolls (like rolled leaves or dough), tied with thin string, on a flour-dusted wooden cutting board with a flat brown dough base. The scene is set in a cozy, warmly lit kitchen with a softly blurred background featuring glowing fairy lights, a silver bucket with green pear-shaped objects, a window with a soft purple light outside, and blurred kitchen utensils. Whimsical, heartwarming atmosphere, high-quality animated film aesthetic."
