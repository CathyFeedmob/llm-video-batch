    "video_prompt": "A person on a motorcycle in a cyberpunk city is speeding through the streets under giant planets. The motorcycle's tail light and the surrounding city lights glow and pulsate softly. Subtle smoke or dust particles kick up from the tires, drifting momentarily behind the motorcycle. The rider's visor glows softly. The planets in the background slowly rotate. The camera subtly tracks forward, following the motorcycle.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A cyberpunk-inspired graphic novel illustration of a lone rider on a futuristic motorcycle, speeding through a neon-lit, desolate alien city under a starry, cosmic sky. The rider, in a sleek, dark armored suit with glowing pink accents, leans into a turn. The motorcycle is highly detailed, metallic, with glowing pink energy trails emanating from its wheels and engine, creating streaks of light along the ground. The road is dark with glowing pink energy lines.\n\nIn the background, colossal, towering brutalist-cyberpunk structures dominate the cityscape, illuminated by soft blue-green and stark pink neon lights. Above, a large, detailed, subtly textured planetary body with rings hangs in the black, star-filled expanse, accompanied by a smaller, cratered moon. The overall color palette is dominated by stark contrasts of electric pink, deep teal-blue, and black. Lighting is dramatic, with glowing neon elements casting vibrant shadows and reflections. The style is reminiscent of highly detailed comic book art, with sharp lines, heavy ink work, and a flattened, graphic quality. Full-body shot, dynamic pose, high angle perspective looking down and forward.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Motorcycle blazes forward, kicking up glowing dust. Tail light pulses, city lights shimmer. Rider's visor flickers. Giant planets drift across the sky as the camera smoothly advances.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A person on a motorcycle in a cyberpunk city is speeding through the streets under giant planets. The motorcycle's tail light and the surrounding city lights explosively flash. Jagged energy arcs violently from the tires, tearing the pavement. The rider's visor blazes with erratic, blinding pulses. Planets in the background violently shake and fissure. The camera aggressively swerves, mimicking a chaotic chase. Buildings buckle and warp, their lights exploding.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A riderless motorcycle hovers, its glowing pink elements dripping downwards as if solid. The street below becomes a reversed waterfall of light, flowing upwards and coalescing into distant planets that shimmer into translucent, merging forms. The motorcycle's shadow stretches and shrinks independently, briefly morphing into a fleeting apparition of a rider before dissolving into wisps of stardust. The city buildings breathe in and out, their glowing windows expanding into swirling nebulae.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "CU of motorcycle's glowing tail light as it speeds away. PULL OUT to reveal rider in full gear, leaning into a sharp turn, pink energy trails behind. SWEEPING CRANE SHOT ascends, revealing towering cyberpunk cityscapes under colossal planets. FADE TO SLOW-MO of dust particles catching iridescent light as the motorcycle accelerates into the celestial horizon.",
