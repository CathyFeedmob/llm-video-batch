    "video_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt suitable for a video generation model, capturing the essence and dynamic potential of the description:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A magnificent, multi-story **East Asian pagoda-ship** navigating a highly turbulent, intricately swirling sea under a vast, luminous, moon-like celestial body in a dark, star-speckled sky. Small gulls fly around the orb. The ship's decks are weathered, with small trees and foliage growing, hinting at a long journey. Rendered in a highly detailed, traditional woodcut/line art style reminiscent of Japanese ukiyo-e, utilizing a limited palette of dark brown, black, beige, and off-white. The waves should exhibit continuous, powerful, and intricate swirling motion, with highlighted breaking foam.\"",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, distilling the essence of the detailed description:\n\n**Highly detailed, intricate woodcut style illustration of an ancient, multi-tiered East Asian pagoda structure built upon a robust wooden ship's hull. The structure has a weathered appearance with small gnarled trees and foliage growing on its decks, resembling a floating island, with a tall mast rising from the ship. The vessel navigates a tempestuous, swirling sea, rendered with dynamic, intricate curvilinear lines and mysterious, fractal-like patterns resembling tangled roots beneath the surface. Above, a dark, star-speckled sky features a large, luminous, textured off-white full moon in the upper right quadrant. The entire artwork uses a limited, almost monochromatic color palette of dark brown, black, beige, and off-white. Vertical orientation.**"
