Individual spheres forming numbers and hands subtly shift as lines extending from them ripple and change intensity. The entire clock face subtly rotates in a minimalist, textured environment.",
  "image_prompt": "Minimalist, monochromatic clock face, grey and black, light grey background. Clock, numbers 1-12, and hands constructed from countless tiny black spheres, creating a tactile texture. Thin, dark lines extend from spheres, suggesting shadows or strands. Hour hand at 12, minute hand slightly past 12. Detailed, high-contrast, artistic.",
