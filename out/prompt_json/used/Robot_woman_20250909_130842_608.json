    "video_prompt": "Subtle light rays shift and dance through the broken roof, illuminating dust motes. The flowers gently sway as if caught in a faint breeze. The character's chest rises and falls rhythmically, indicating slow, deep breaths. Her long hair slightly shimmers. A subtle glint catches on her metallic suit as if from a light source gently moving. The camera has a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom in on the character.",
    "image_prompt": "A full-body shot of a beautiful, ethereal cybernetic woman with very long, flowing platinum blonde hair, lying on an ornate, faded floral-patterned armchair amidst a vibrant and overgrown field of wildflowers reminiscent of an abandoned futuristic garden. The woman is wearing a sleek, form-fitting iridescent silver metallic suit with segmented robotic elements, reflecting a colorful sheen. Her eyes are closed, suggesting peaceful sleep or contemplation. The setting is an old, ruined wooden building or shed with a partially collapsed roof, allowing dappled sunlight to filter through and illuminate the scene, creating a soft, dreamy atmosphere. The overall composition is a blend of decay and futuristic beauty, with flowers in various hues like orange, white, pink, purple, and blue. The light is natural and airy, highlighting the textures of the suit and the delicate petals of the flowers. The style combines elements of sci-fi, fantasy, and overgrown nature, having a slightly melancholic yet serene mood. There's a small pink flower delicately placed near her left robotic hand. The vibrant flora contrasts with the muted wooden tones of the structure and the reflective silver of her suit. A small signature is present in the bottom right corner with \"cc9\".",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Light rays subtly shift, dust dances. Flowers gently sway. Chest rises and falls, hair slightly shimmers. A subtle glint moves across the suit. Camera imperceptibly zooms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent winds rip through the decaying roof, debris plummeting. Flowers thrash wildly, petals tearing. The metallic suit pulses with blinding light, joints hissing and grinding as the character's body convulses. Her eyes snap open, glowing fiercely. Hair whips around her face, crackling with energy. The camera rapidly zooms and pans, simulating a sudden, disorienting impact.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "As dust motes spiral upward, flowers undulate in reverse-gravity, drawing dewdrops from below. The character’s chest pulsates with an ethereal glow, her metallic skin shimmering through a spectrum of impossible hues. Strands of hair intertwine with light rays, forming bioluminescent tendrils that reach into the decaying roof, which slowly reassembles itself. The character’s form gently unfurls, as if blossoming from within, stretching paradoxically inward as the camera zooms into a vanishing point.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Subtle light rays dance through the broken roof, spotlighting dust motes. A slow, dramatic rack focus from the swaying wildflowers to the character’s serene face, revealing a soft, rhythmic rise and fall of her chest. Her iridescent suit subtly gleams as the light shifts. The camera executes a slow, cinematic push-in, culminating in a poignant close-up of her hand, where a vibrant bloom is delicately clutched, before slowly tilting upwards to capture the tranquil scene.",
