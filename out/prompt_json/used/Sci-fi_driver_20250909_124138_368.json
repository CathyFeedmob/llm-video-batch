    "video_prompt": "A subtle upward camera tilt reveals the immense planetscape, while the human-robot's hair gently sways to the left. The light on the dashboard flickers softly, and a faint shimmering emanates from the holographic map. The cat's whiskers twitch occasionally, and its tail gives a slight, unnoticeable flick. Distant heat haze causes the landscape to subtly ripple.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA futuristic vehicle cockpit, viewed from a slightly high, wide-angle perspective looking forward. A young East Asian woman with long, black hair in a high ponytail sits in the driver's seat, wearing a sleek, dark metallic cyberpunk suit with visible robotic integrated parts on her arms and legs, operating a sophisticated steering yolk with red glowing buttons. Directly in front of her is a large, transparent holographic display showing a detailed navigational map with a network of lines and waypoints, glowing with a bright blue-green light.\n\nTo the right, on the passenger seat, a fluffy, light grey tabby cat with green eyes sits upright and alert, wearing a small, metallic, partially cybernetic collar. The cat's expression is curious and calm.\n\nThrough the large, rounded windshield, a vast, alien desert landscape stretches into the distance under a pale, diffused sky. A massive, cratered exoplanet hangs prominently in the upper left of the sky, with a smaller, luminous moon floating to its right, casting a soft glow. In the mid-ground on the left, a large, futuristic spaceship or aircraft hovers, partially visible. On the right, a tall, multi-story futuristic building or structure, possibly a communication tower or launchpad, emits bright, crackling energy beams reaching into the sky, resembling lightning. A wide, empty paved road or runway extends directly towards this structure from the foreground. Scattered around the desert are other smaller, boxy futuristic structures and vehicles.\n\nThe lighting is soft and ethereal, indicating a dawn or dusk on an alien world, with a cool blue and gray predominant color scheme, punctuated by the holographic display's glow and subtle warm reflections. The overall atmosphere is one of advanced technology, exploration, and a comfortable, unusual companionship in a grand, quiet setting. Subtle lens flares or atmospheric haze add to the depth.\n\n**Art Style:** Hyperrealistic, Sci-fi illustration, high detail.\n**Composition:** Rule of thirds applied to important elements (driver, cat, planet, main structure), leading lines from the road, strong foreground-to-background depth.\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused ambient light, glowing holographic elements, subtle light sources from the energy beams, hints of rim lighting on the figures.\n**Colors:** Dominant cool blues, grays, and pale earth tones, with bright blue-green accents from the display and subtle reds from the controls.\n**Atmosphere:** Calm, mysterious, technologically advanced, expansive, quietly adventurous.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera subtly tilts up. Humanoid's hair sways left. Dashboard light flickers. Holographic map shimmers faintly. Cat's whiskers twitch; tail subtly flicks. Distant landscape ripples with heat haze.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent tremors buffet the cockpit, shaking the human-robot's head wildly as the planetscape outside lurches. The dashboard lights explode into chaotic, strobing flashes, while the holographic map shatters into a swirling vortex of energy. The cat erupts into a furious, snarling beast, claws extended and tail thrashing, eyes glowing with malevolent fire. The distant structures on the horizon twist and contort, dissolving into dust.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The planetscape outside warps into a shimmering kaleidoscope, its moons spiraling backward into imploded stars. The human-robot's hair elongates into ethereal tendrils, phasing through the vehicle's ceiling as the dashboard's light solidifies into liquid, flowing onto the seat beside a now-translucent cat. Its whiskers, now antennae, vibrate with impossible frequencies, while its invisible tail generates miniature black holes that devour and regurgitate fragmented light from the holographic map. Distant heat haze transforms into solid, crystalline structures, slowly levitating into the impossible sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A subtle upward camera tilt reveals the immense planetscape, as a sleek spaceship descends from the sky. The human-robot, with hair gently swaying, grips the steering wheel. A sudden jolt rocks the vehicle; the dashboard lights flicker wildly. The holographic map pulsates with an urgent, red shimmer. The cat's ears flatten, its tail lashes from side to side. The camera dramatically zooms onto the human-robot's determined eyes, then sweeps across the desolate, now rippling, landscape. Credits roll as the ship barrels towards an uncertain future.",
