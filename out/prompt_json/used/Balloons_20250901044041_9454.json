    "video_prompt": "Generate a vertical video of a magical nighttime festival. Hundreds of glowing hot air balloons and sky lanterns (warm oranges/yellows) gently ascend into a deep blue, starry, nebulous sky. Below, a vast, softly lit crowd watches, interspersed with ground lanterns, while a lone figure (back to camera) gazes in wonder in the foreground. The overall mood is dreamlike, serene, and wondrous, with cool blue/purple skies contrasting with warm, radiant lights.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n\"A vertical, magical and enchanting night festival scene. Thousands of glowing hot air balloons and sky lanterns fill a deep indigo blue, starry sky with faint nebulae, emanating warm orange, peach, and yellow light, with some lavender/mauve hues on larger balloons. A vast crowd fills the lower third, illuminated by many ground lanterns. In the foreground, a young woman, seen from behind, wearing a light shirt and dark skirt, gazes in wonder at the spectacle, with small silhouetted figures nearby. The cool blues and purples of the night sky dramatically contrast with the warm, radiant lights, creating a dreamlike, ethereal, and wondrous atmosphere of festive celebration.\""
