    "video_prompt": "Falling leaves gently sway and drift to the ground, scattered by a subtle breeze. The light subtly flickers through the bare branches, creating dancing shadows on the path. Tiny white particles shimmer and occasionally float upwards like dust motes in the sunlight. A gentle, almost imperceptible undulation of the background trees suggests a very soft wind.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical watercolor painting depicting a solitary figure walking away down a tree-lined path. The trees, mostly bare with some small white and yellow specks, frame the path, creating a tunnel effect. The sky transitions from a rich blue on the left to a warm, glowing yellow on the right, suggesting either dawn or dusk. Yellow and blue leaves are scattered and falling through the air around the figure and on the path. A grey directional sign pole is on the right-hand side of the path, with a grey arrow pointing forward, reading \"This Way\" in black text. The path itself is dappled with sunlight and shadows cast by the trees, leading to a bright, hazy light at the end. The overall atmosphere is serene and contemplative. The art style is painterly, with visible brushstrokes and a soft, ethereal quality. The composition funnels the eye towards the vanishing point, emphasizing depth and the journey ahead.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Leaves twirl and descend, scattering across the path. Light dances through branches, casting shifting shadows. Tiny particles shimmer and ascend like dust motes. Background trees subtly sway, hinting at a gentle breeze.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent gusts rip leaves from branches,\nA whirlwind of foliage engulfs the scene,\nBare trees thrash, their silhouettes twisting against the sky like monstrous limbs,\nLight explodes through the branches, beams shatter and reform,\nWhite particles erupt from the ground in a shimmering cloud, a sudden, blinding storm,\nThe path itself buckles and shifts, defying solid ground,\nTrees in the distance convulse, writhing in silent agony.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Leaves, impossibly vibrant and sharp-edged, spiral upwards against gravity, transforming into liquid light as they merge with trees that breathe like lungs. Shadows twist into solid, living entities, dancing an impossible waltz with the path, which itself ripples like water. Distant trees, now a shimmering, crystalline lattice, pulse with an internal light, occasionally shedding glittering particles that float down, then snap upwards like tethered stars. The man, a mere silhouette, walks forward while simultaneously dissolving backward, leaving trails of color in his wake.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone figure walks down a leaf-strewn path, a distant \"This Way\" sign almost concealed. As falling leaves, both golden and deep blue, swirl around him, an abrupt breeze sweeps through the trees, making their bare branches sway dramatically and casting erratic, flickering shadows. The camera executes a slow, deliberate zoom towards the sign, then abruptly pans to reveal tiny, glowing particles rising like dust motes towards the faint, shifting light above while the deep blue leaves on the ground begin to undulate subtly as if stirring to life, creating an eerie, almost magical undercurrent.",
