    "video_prompt": "Subtle rain streaks down the window, a gentle sway of the train shifts the girl's hair, and water droplets sporadically hit the glass.",
    "image_prompt": "A melancholic anime-style painting, viewed from inside a train car, a young woman with long dark hair, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and a dark pleated skirt, sitting on a light blue train seat, her hands clasped in her lap. Her gaze is directed out the train window, which reveals a rain-streaked view of railroad tracks stretching into the distance, flanked by distant mountains under a dark, overcast sky. Rain streaks visible on the window glass, with raindrops and reflections on the train interior too. The overall scene is cool-toned, dominated by blues, grays, and subtle greens, conveying a somber and introspective atmosphere. A signature or text element is present in the bottom right corner. The lighting is dim, suggesting either early morning, late evening, or a heavily overcast day, with focus on the ambient light coming from outside the window despite the rain. The art style is painterly with gentle blending.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rain streaks intensify then fade, causing the train's reflection to ripple. The girl's posture subtly adjusts to the train's gentle lurch, her hair shifting with the motion. Water droplets race across the glass, then slow and coalesce.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden train jolt flings girl forward, hair whips violently. Glass shatters as rain explodes inward. Tracks blur impossibly fast. Mountains heave, sky flashes. Water forms menacing hands, tearing at the window. The train bucks and twists, an iron beast possessed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The rain streaks reverse, pulling water upwards into impossible forms that dance against the window. The train car slowly unravels into liquid air, reforming into a swirling vortex of light. Her hair, now tendrils of starlight, gently extends, weaving beyond the glass and coalescing into miniature, shimmering galaxies that drift outwards, the entire scene oscillating between solid and ether with a resonant, impossible hum.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone girl gazes out a rainy train window. The camera dramatically zooms through rain streaks to reveal the blurred, receding track. A sudden lurch, followed by a subtle shift, sends her hair swirling as her hand, clenched yet delicate, subtly tightens. As the train accelerates, raindrops race horizontally across the glass, reflecting the melancholic landscape.",
