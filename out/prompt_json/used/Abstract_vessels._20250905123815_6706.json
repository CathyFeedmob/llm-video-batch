  "video_prompt": "Transparent teardrop vessels subtly sway, their inner contents shifting: geometric structures gently rotate, abstract forms subtly reconfigure, and stacked cubes imperceptibly settle. Background colors subtly pulse, and ornate golden patterns slowly unfurl.",
  "image_prompt": "Vibrant, surreal digital artwork of three large, transparent, teardrop-shaped vessels suspended against a rich, theatrical background. The background features a fuchsia/magenta to dark purple gradient, red fabric folds, intricate golden baroque patterns with floral motifs, and ruffled magenta flowers.\n\nThe leftmost vessel, blue-tinted, contains three white cubic blocks (sugar cubes) with a glowing star behind them. The central, largest vessel, with a purple to blue/teal gradient, holds a complex geometric structure: an open-work metal cube surrounded by a lattice resembling a stylized boat, intensely illuminated by a starburst. The rightmost vessel, teal-tinted, encloses a deconstructed, abstract white wooden ship with dark shadows.\n\nSmaller, partial vessels with sugar cubes are visible at the bottom. The text \"c29\" in bold, glossy white is in the bottom right corner. The artwork features strong reflections and refractions, combining realistic transparency with fantastical elements, evoking themes of science, history, and abstraction.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Subtly swaying, translucent forms reveal inner contents shifting. Geometric structures gently rotate, abstract shapes subtly reconfigure, and stacked cubes imperceptibly settle within these dynamic boundaries. Background colors subtly pulse and transition. Ornate golden patterns slowly unfurl and expand across the space."
