    "video_prompt": "Rain streaks subtly down, puddles shimmer with ripples from falling drops. Lanterns gently flicker, casting soft, dancing reflections on the wet ground. The man's kimono subtly sways with an imperceptible breeze.",
    "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** A full-body shot of a solitary male figure, viewed from behind, walking away down a narrow, wet alleyway in a traditional Japanese town at night. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved yukata or kimono and holding a dark umbrella over his head, shedding rainwater. His dark hair is short and slightly spiky.\n\nThe alley is illuminated by numerous glowing orange and white paper lanterns hanging from posts and buildings on both sides, creating reflections on the highly reflective, rain-soaked ground. Rain streaks are visible in the background against the dark, cloudy sky. Traditional Japanese-style wooden buildings line the sides of the alley, some with illuminated sign boards featuring Japanese text. Utility poles with intricate wiring are present on the left side of the alley. The atmosphere is quiet, serene, and slightly melancholic.\n\n**Style:** Anime, detailed, vibrant, atmospheric.\n\n**Composition:** Full shot, Rule of Thirds applied to the figure.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant deep blues and grays for the night sky and rain, contrasted by warm oranges and soft yellows from the lanterns. Subtle reflections of these colors on the wet ground.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused light emanating from the lanterns, casting glowing pools on the ground. Raindrops are highlighted by the light.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Peaceful, contemplative, rainy night in an old town.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rain intensifies, forming dynamic rivulets. Puddles ripple outwards from splashing drops. Lantern light flickers erratically, reflections darting across the disturbed water. The man's kimono billows and settles as he shifts his weight.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Torrential downpour SLAMS down, shattering puddles into explosive geysers! Lanterns violently THROB, unleashing blinding, erratic light that PULSATES on the ground. The man's kimono RIPS and WRITHES, consumed by a chaotic, unseen force. Buildings on either side suddenly LURCH and CRACK, their reflections on the furious water WARPING and DISTORTING. Rain itself REVERSES course, SHOT upwards in a blinding stream. CHAOS!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Rain ascends in shimmering streaks, forming glowing pathways to lanterns that slowly unfurl like bioluminescent blooms. The man's kimono, made of liquid moonlight, ripples upwards, gravity's embrace forgotten. Puddles become portals, reflecting distorted realities where buildings breathe and the street bends into a spectral ribbon. His umbrella pulses, exhaling starlight instead of repelling rain, as footsteps echo from possible futures.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Rain lashes down. Extreme close-up on a puddle, a single drop creates a perfect ripple. Swift pan left reveals a lantern, its light flickering dramatically as the camera pulls back to a wide shot. The manâ€™s kimono, caught by a sudden gust, billows around him as he slowly raises his umbrella, its wet surface catching the gleam of the lanterns.",
