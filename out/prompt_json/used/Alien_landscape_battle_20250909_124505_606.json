    "video_prompt": "Smoke billows gently from the fire, embers drift upwards, and light subtly flickers across the scene. The giant tentacles pulse and shift imperceptibly. Subtle glints of light shift across the metallic surfaces of the vehicles and the large mechanism, suggesting movement.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed and epic, cinematic wide shot of a futuristic battlefield, reminiscent of Warhammer 40,000 merged with elements of cosmic horror.\n\n**Visual Elements and Composition:**\nThe scene is dominated by a colossal, biomechanical structure resembling a giant eye or target reticle, glowing with intense orange light and equipped with intricate machinery and red, organic tendrils. This massive entity looms in the background, anchoring the composition. In the midground, to the left, is a smaller, mechanical structure spewing large flames and smoke, its base covered in similar organic tendrils. In the foreground and midground, multiple heavily armored, tracked vehicles with prominent weaponry are positioned, one facing right and another, partially visible, facing left. The ground is a grotesque landscape of reddish-brown, organic masses resembling raw flesh and exposed organs, interspersed with small, textured, yellowish-green bulbous growths. A large, circular, glowing golden geometric pattern is etched into the ground, a striking contrast to the organic chaos. A futuristic, heavily detailed gun barrel is visible in the bottom left foreground, blurring slightly to indicate depth of field.\n\n**Style and Atmosphere:**\nThe style is dark, gritty, and industrial sci-fi with strong horror undertones. The atmosphere is oppressive, chaotic, and otherworldly, conveying a sense of ongoing conflict and a profound alien presence. The overall mood is grim and intense.\n\n**Colors and Lighting:**\nThe dominant colors are deep reds, oranges, and dark grays/blacks. The primary light source comes from the glowing orange elements of the colossal structure and the bright flames from the burning object, casting warm, dramatic highlights and deep shadows across the scene. Ambient light is dim and misty, creating a smoky, hazy background that adds to the mysterious and ominous feeling. The golden patterns on the ground provide a stark, luminous accent.\n\n**Keywords to consider for prompt:**\nWarhammer 40,000, cosmic horror, biomechanical, alien landscape, futuristic battlefield, epic, cinematic, highly detailed, colossal structure, glowing eye, target reticle, organic tendrils, mech, tracked vehicle, heavy weaponry, burning, smoke, raw flesh, grotesque, ancient runes, golden sigil, dark, grim, oppressive, intense, dramatic lighting, volumetric lighting, deep shadows, mist, vapor.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Smoke billows and embers drift. Light subtly flickers. Tentacles pulse and shift. Light glints dynamically across surfaces.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Flames erupt violently from the inferno, propelled by a sudden, unseen force, sending a whirlwind of embers spiraling upwards. The colossal tentacles lash out with explosive speed, tearing through the landscape. Metallic mechanisms shudder and groan, rapidly reconfiguring with intense bursts of light, as the ground buckles and splits beneath them. The vehicles violently shift, their turrets snapping into new positions, ready for an immediate, brutal assault.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The infernal flames writhe downwards, sucking embers into the earth as tentacles unravel and ascend into the darkening sky. Metallic vehicles melt into flowing organic goo, then re-solidify into shimmering, impossible geometries, their light rippling outwards, painting the scene in vibrant, non-existent hues. The gigantic mechanism sighs, its glowing rings detaching and reforming into a constellation of impossible stars.  Reality itself warps, folding and unfolding like paper, as the warped ground pulsates with an unheard beat.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow-motion pan over the fiery destruction, tentacles subtly coiling tighter around structures. The camera dramatically zooms onto the giant glowing mechanism, its intricate gears grinding slower. Embers rise gracefully towards the obscured sky, their light reflecting off the armored vehicles as they slowly angle their ominous guns. The entire scene pulsates with a dim, eerie glow as if the world itself is breathing a final, labored breath. The golden symbols on the ground shimmer as if infused with a dying magic.",
