    "video_prompt": "A colossal monster with glowing eyes lets out a roar, its body enveloped in flames and flickering embers. Distant buildings are aglow with fiery explosions. The massive tail of the monster sways, trailing smoke. Tiny figures on a bridge evacuate, some looking up in terror. Debris and particles float in the air around the monster.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on recreating the visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere of the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A colossal, monstrous figure reminiscent of Godzilla, with glowing blue spines and eyes, and armored plating, standing amidst a devastated futuristic city at night. Its face is a terrifying snarl, teeth bared.\n\n**Composition:** High-angle, aerial view looking down into the city. The monster dominates the upper-middle of the frame, towering over buildings. Below, a chaotic scene unfolds with crowds of tiny, fleeing people on streets and a pedestrian bridge. Flames and smoke rise from multiple fiery destructions throughout the city, particularly around the monster and in the foreground. Tall, modern skyscrapers with illuminated windows frame the scene.\n\n**Environment:** Dark, urban night sky with scattered clouds and faint stars. Debris and what appear to be meteors or falling objects streak across the distant sky. Other smaller, dark, flying objects (possibly aircraft or drones) are visible in the upper background.\n\n**Lighting:** Predominantly dramatic and chaotic. The monster glows intensely with an internal blue light that casts a radiant aura. Intense, warm orange and red light erupts from the numerous fires, creating strong contrasts with the cool blues of the monster and the distant city lights. Overall ambient light is low and desaturated, emphasizing the destruction and fear. Some streetlights and building lights are visible, but many are engulfed in darkness or obscured by smoke.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant palette of deep blues (monster, sky, some city elements) and fiery oranges/reds (explosions, smoke, atmospheric glow). Muted grays and blacks for buildings and shadows. Small pops of white/yellow from distant un-impacted lights.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Apocalyptic, terrifying, action-packed, and chaotic. A sense of overwhelming power and despair. The air is thick with smoke and dust.\n\n**Style:** Photorealistic, highly detailed, cinematic, and epic in scope. Inspired by dark fantasy and sci-fi monster movies. Sharp focus on the monster and immediate foreground, with slightly softer focus on distant elements to create depth.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   Visible structural damage on buildings, some crumbling or partially destroyed.\n*   The pedestrian bridge in the foreground is packed with running, desperate people.\n*   Reflections of fire can be seen on some building surfaces.\n*   Subtle sense of movement and urgency in the fleeing crowds.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The monster's fiery body shimmers and pulsates as it roars, embers spiraling outwards. Distant explosions light cityscapes. Its colossal tail sways, disrupting air with a smoke trail. Tiny figures move frantically across a bridge, craning necks in terror. Debris and particles swirl around the creature.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Massive Godzilla's glowing eyes ignite into blinding explosions. His colossal tail whips, tearing buildings into showering debris. Fiery explosions erupt from ground zero, sending people scattering in panic across dynamic bridges, their screams echoing. Buildings violently collapse. Smoke plumes surge, morphing into spectral forms, as flames dance wildly, consuming everything.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A colossal kaiju, scales shimmering with impossible hues, lets out a silent roar, its sound rippling backward through space. Flames cascade upwards, coalescing into liquid light that paints the sky. Distant buildings morph into crystalline structures before dissipating into stardust. Its tail becomes a living serpent, weaving impossible geometries. Tiny figures on a bridge float effortlessly into the sky, their fear transforming into serene wonder as the world folds in on itself.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A colossal monster, with glowing eyes and engulfed in flames, lets out a guttural roar, its massive tail sweeping through skyscrapers, setting them ablaze. A wide shot reveals panicked people scurrying on a bridge below, a few looking up in terror. The camera dramatically zooms in on the creature's menacing gaze then pulls back, revealing distant explosions as debris rains down.",
