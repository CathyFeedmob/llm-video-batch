  "video_prompt": "The robot-like spider's iridescent blue and white body and legs subtly shift, emanating a soft blue glow that pulses faintly. Its numerous segments and joints articulate with precise, fluid motions, hinting at potential locomotion across the textured gray surface. The metallic elements subtly reflect changes in ambient light.",
  "image_prompt": "Detailed, high-quality, eye-level full shot of a futuristic robot spider on a dark gray surface. The spider is iridescent blue and white, with a segmented, robotic body. Its ovular cephalothorax features metallic white and blue plates with a white cross pattern and silver-gray nuts, and two small, silver-rimmed indentations resembling eyes. Eight thin, cylindrical legs with gold and silver/black joints and royal blue segments extend from the body, terminating in delicate white and blue cylindrical segments. Parts of the spider glow with a blue phosphorescent light. The background is a smooth, out-of-focus gray. Sleek, modern, imposing.",
