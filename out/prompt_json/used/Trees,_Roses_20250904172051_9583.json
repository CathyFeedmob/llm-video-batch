  "video_prompt": "Sunlight streams through tree branches, causing a bright starburst. Hanging roses gently sway downwards from above. Ground-level roses subtly shift, reaching towards the light amidst their lush foliage. Clouds drift across the blue sky. ",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a low-angle, surreal outdoor scene: a large, textured tree trunk on the left, its branches framing a sun-starbursted, clear blue sky with scattered clouds. Numerous perfectly formed, light pink to peach roses hang from the upper canopy like a rain of flowers. In the lower right, a bush of similar, in-focus roses (some red/dark pink) grows upwards with lush green foliage. The overall impression is a magical blend of nature and fantasy.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Dynamic sunlight flits and flares through shifting tree canopies. Hanging roses gently undulate downwards. Ground-level roses subtly unfurl and turn, their foliage softly rustling towards the light. Clouds drift unhurriedly across the sky."
