    "video_prompt": "Subtle orange light glows and flickers within the robot's mechanical components, especially around the eye area and within the exposed gears and wiring. The internal gears and mechanisms have a very subtle, almost imperceptible turn or shift, suggesting a dormant operational state.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"Highly detailed, close-up profile shot of a sophisticated humanoid robot, resembling a woman's head and upper torso. The robot is primarily constructed from highly polished, glossy black material, with intricate internal mechanisms and accents in bright, polished gold and fiery orange.\n\nThe right side of the robot's head (camera right) is a complex array of brass gears, cogs, wires, and metallic tubes, meticulously designed and interwoven. Large, circular gold components with radial lines and smaller gears are prominent. The top of the head features a metallic, segmented casing.\n\nThe robot's face is smooth, black, and reflective, with an elegant, almost human-like profile. Its eye (visible on the right) glows with an intense, warm orange light from within, creating a luminous effect. Orange lighting also spills from internal visible components around the head and neck.\n\nThe neck and upper torso are exposed, revealing a dense network of gold pipes, silver wires, springs, pistons, and orange-glowing mechanical parts. The overall aesthetic is a blend of futuristic technology and intricate clockwork mechanisms.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic and studio-quality, with precise highlights on the glossy black surfaces and vibrant illumination from the orange internal glows. The background transitions from solid black on the left to a bright, soft gray on the right, providing strong contrast while keeping the focus entirely on the robot. The atmosphere is sleek, technological, and slightly mysterious.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle, flickering orange light emanates from the robot's eye and internal mechanisms, intensifying with an imperceptible hum. Gears slightly rotate, hinting at latent function.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Unleash the dormant power! Robot's inner gears explode into a whirlwind of furious motion, limbs ripping apart and reconfiguring with aggressive, whirring intensity. Orange light erupts, blinding, as metallic tendrils coil and lash in a violent, electrifying surge. Watch the head snap, chassis contort, a mechanical beast awakened to chaotic, unpredictable fury.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robot's internal gears and wires swirl like sentient galaxies, shimmering with orange light that pulls entire dimensions into its core. Time reverses within the eye, showing nascent memories ripple outward, transforming wires into organic root systems that bloom impossible flowers. Gravity inverts for a microsecond, making internal components levitate and reform into swirling nebulae before collapsing back into metallic impossibilities, all accompanied by a chorus of unseen, impossible melodies.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in begins on the robot's glowing eye, a subtle pulse of orange light expanding as if awakening. The camera then glides back, revealing intricate gears and wiring within its shoulders slowly beginning to rotate, accompanied by faint sparks. A sharp, quick pan follows a critical mechanical arm as it extends slowly, then retracts with a soft whir, hinting at impending action. The entire scene is bathed in a dramatic shift from stark shadow to a sharp, contrasting orange glow.",
