  "image_prompt": "Generate a vertical medium shot of a young East Asian woman in a recording studio. She has long, dark brown hair in a ponytail with sun-kissed wisps, and side-swept bangs. She wears a white off-the-shoulder knitted top, with black and gold \"AKG\" headphones resting on her neck. Her fair skin is softly lit, with natural makeup and a contemplative expression as she looks slightly upwards to the left. Her right hand rests on a sound mixing board with visible controls. A studio microphone and pop filter are in the foreground. The background features a studio window with circular blue, pink, and yellow bokeh, and a faint wavy pattern. The scene is bathed in warm, bright light with subtle white speckles.",
