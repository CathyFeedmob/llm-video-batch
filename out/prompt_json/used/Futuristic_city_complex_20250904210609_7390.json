  "image_prompt": "A massive, multi-layered circular city/structure, resembling an amphitheater or power station, made of light stone/metal, in a vast turquoise body of water. Glowing blue energy emanates from and surrounds the structure, with light bands tracing concentric rings and crackling electrical discharges flowing into the water. An ornate bridge connects the structure to lush green cliffs with numerous waterfalls. A rugged mountain range is in the background under a dramatic, cloudy sky. Fusion of ancient architecture, futuristic energy, and powerful nature.",
