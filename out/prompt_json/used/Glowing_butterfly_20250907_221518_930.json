    "video_prompt": "A gentle swaying of the translucent butterfly wings. Subtle flaring and dimming of the light emanating from the butterfly's body. The glowing \"dandelions\" shimmer softly. Tiny light particles drift upwards like fireflies. The light patterns projected onto the path slowly undulate. Faint shimmering on the metallic grass blades.",
    "image_prompt": "A fantastical digital artwork depicting a vibrant, glowing blue and white butterfly positioned centrally, its intricate, translucent wings detailed with internal light patterns. The butterfly hovers over a magically lit, enchanting forest path at night. The foreground features glowing, metallic-looking blue grass or plant structures forming arched tunnels, interspersed with small, glowing blue orbs on the ground and within shrubbery. Further back, numerous bioluminescent dandelion-like flowers with spiky blue and white glows populate the scene.\n\nA partial, golden full moon shines brightly in the upper right background, casting a soft, warm light that contrasts with the predominant cool blue tones. Vertical strands of glowing blue light akin to rain or fiber optics stretch from top to bottom, enhancing the magical atmosphere. The ground features intricate, fern-like shadow patterns created by the light effects. The overall color palette is dominated by deep blues, luminous whites, and touches of gold from the moon. The style is highly detailed, ethereal, and dreamlike, with a luminous and shimmering quality. The lighting is low-key, with strong localized glows. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye to the central butterfly and leading it along the illuminated path. There is a shimmering effect and depth of field, with slight bokeh in the background. The bottom right corner features a silver, metallic \"C29\" with reflections from the scene.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Translucent butterfly wings gently sway, their embodied light subtly flaring and dimming. Glowing \"dandelions\" shimmer softly. Tiny light particles drift like rising fireflies. Projected path patterns undulate. Metallic grass blades faintly shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The butterfly's translucent wings violently snap open and shut, emitting blinding, strobing flares. The glowing \"dandelions\" suddenly erupt into pulsating bursts of light. Tiny, electrified light particles surge upwards in a chaotic torrent. The light patterns on the path violently ripple and distort. The metallic grass blades thrash and writhe as if alive. The moon pulsates dynamically.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The translucent butterfly wings pulse with a reversed luminescence, drawing in light. The metallic grass blades ripple upwards, levitating. Glowing dandelions detach, spiraling into the sky, their light coalescing into a shimmering moon that expands then shrinks. The ground beneath the path warps into a liquid mirror, flowing backwards, reflecting impossible constellations of light formed by the descending \"firefly\" particles.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A powerful, slow zoom into the translucent butterfly, revealing intricate wing patterns as its light dramatically pulses, illuminating the enchanting scene. The camera then gracefully pans across the shimmering, glowing \"dandelions\" and the metallic grass, highlighting the gentle sway, before ending on the mesmerizing, undulating light patterns on the path. Subtle shifts in the ambient lighting deepen the magical atmosphere.",
