    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the analysis of the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A warm, inviting full-shot photograph of a young Asian couple sitting facing each other at a wooden cafe table. The man is on the left, wearing a dark grey sweatshirt and blue jeans, looking intently at the woman. The woman is on the right, wearing a cozy brown knitted sweater and a black skirt, resting her chin on her hand, looking back at him. They both have dark hair. Two white coffee cups with latte art sit on the table between them, along with an open book.\n\nThe scene is set inside a cafe with a large window on the left, offering a blurred view of a vibrant orange and yellow sunset or dusk, creating long, streaky light trails from outside traffic, suggesting motion or cityscape lights. The window pane shows subtle reflections and faint lines of rain or dirt. The cafe interior features dark teal or deep blue-green wooden paneling or window frames, adding a rustic and intimate feel.\n\nThe lighting is soft and warm, emanating primarily from the sunset/street lights outside, casting a gentle, glowing ambiance inside the cafe. There are also subtle reflections of indoor lights visible in the window. The overall atmosphere is intimate, romantic, and contemplative, feeling like a quiet, shared moment. The composition is balanced, with both subjects prominently featured, framed by the window and cafe interior. The image has a naturalistic, slightly desaturated, and cinematic quality.\"",
