    "video_prompt": "Gentle ripples expand across the water, reflecting the soft glow of floating lights. Lotus flowers subtly sway, and delicate cherry blossoms drift downwards. The ethereal blue light from the glowing crosses pulses softly. Water cascades down the steps, its flow consistent but with subtle shimmering variations. Tiny, glowing particles ascend from the water and flutter through the air.",
    "image_prompt": "An ethereal and fantastical outdoor scene in an Asian-inspired garden. The architectural elements feature stately stone columns and multi-tiered pagodas with ornate roofs, all surrounded by lush, vibrant nature.\n\n**Composition:** The scene is framed by towering stone structures and a cascading series of platforms and steps. A serene body of water flows in the foreground, interspersed with large, smooth rocks. The eye is drawn along the illuminated steps and water flows towards the enchanting structures in the background.\n\n**Elements:**\n* **Architecture:** Ancient-looking stone columns with intricate carvings and dark, multi-tiered pagoda-style roofs. Some structures resemble elaborate fountains.\n* **Water:** A series of glowing, turquoise waterfalls cascade down multiple levels of stone steps, pooling into a reflective body of water in the foreground. Small ripples and subtle reflections are visible on the water's surface.\n* **Flora:** Delicate pink and white cherry blossoms (sakura) adorn the branches of trees and intertwine with the stone architectures. Pink water lilies (lotus flowers) float on the water and along its edges.\n* **Light & Atmosphere:** The scene is bathed in a soft, ambient blue light emanating from the waterfalls and glowing cross symbols. Scattered golden fairy lights or fireflies dot the air, adding a magical glow. The overall atmosphere is mystical, serene, and otherworldly.\n* **Specific Details:** Noticeable are the glowing, stylized cross or sword-like symbols embedded within arches and on fountains, emitting a vibrant turquoise light. Small sparkles and light streaks accompany the light sources.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by cool blues and teals for the water and ambient light, contrasted with warm pinks from the blossoms. Dark grey and brown tones for the stone and tree trunks provide grounding.\n\n**Art Style:** A blend of fantasy art and traditional Asian aesthetics, with a strong emphasis on glowing, luminous elements. The detail level is high, with a painterly yet almost photorealistic quality to the textures and lighting.\n\n**Overall Impression:** A tranquil and enchanting fantasy landscape, reminiscent of a mythical sanctuary or ancient, magical garden at twilight.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Ripples expand and contract across the water's surface. Floating lights subtly glow and dim. Lotus flowers gently sway. Cherry blossoms drift downwards. Ethereal blue light from crosses pulses softly. Water consistently cascades down steps, with subtle shimmering variations in its flow. Tiny glowing particles ascend and flutter.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive geysers erupt from the glowing crosses, blasting water upwards into a tumultuous torrent. The ornate pillars shatter and crumble, revealing monstrous, gnarled tree limbs that writhe violently. Cherry blossoms transform into razor-sharp projectiles, swirling in a deadly vortex. Lotus flowers contort into glowing eyes, staring menacingly, as the ground shakes and cracks with an intense, earth-shattering roar.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gentle ripples *contract* across the water, *absorbing* the soft glow of floating lights. Lotus flowers *rapidly bloom and retract*, while cherry blossoms *spiral upwards* into branches. Ethereal blue light from crosses *teleports* between structures. Water *flows upwards*, defying gravity, then *morphs* into shimmering crystals. Tiny, glowing particles *emerge from the sky*, *coalescing* into water as they descend.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, cinematic pan reveals ancient architecture bathed in ethereal blues. A gentle zoom in highlights the pulsating glow of the crosses, the light intensifying as a single cherry blossom drifts dramatically past a lotus flower, landing softly on the water. The camera then tracks the cascading water, catching the shimmering variations as glowing particles rise and swirl, creating a magical aura. The shot pulls back, encompassing the grand, mystical scene, concluding with a fade to black as a subtle, final flicker of light echoes.",
