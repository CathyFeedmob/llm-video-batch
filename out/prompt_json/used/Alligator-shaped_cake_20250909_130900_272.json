    "video_prompt": "Subtle eye blinks, slight rise and fall of the body suggesting breathing, small trembles in the cake's texture, and a gentle left-to-right camera zoom.",
    "image_prompt": "A close-up, high-angle shot of a cute, cartoonish crocodile-shaped cake, bathed in soft, natural light, on a plain white background. The cake is primarily a vibrant, light green, resembling matcha or pistachio, with a slightly textured, velvety surface like mousse or fine sponge crumbles. The crocodile has large, innocent eyes made of white and dark brown circles, protruding from its head. Its mouth is open slightly, revealing a creamy white filling inside, with a thin line of darker cake marking the separation of the upper and lower jaws. Small, triangular, light green protrusions line its back, mimicking crocodile scales. The composition is focused on the front half of the crocodile, with its head and part of its body visible. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the contours and textures of the cake. The overall atmosphere is playful and inviting, emphasizing the delightful appearance of the dessert. In the top left corner, there's a small gray rectangle with \"AI 生成\" written in black. In the bottom right corner, \"C29\" is written in black, stylized text.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are refined video prompts, focusing exclusively on movement, changes, human expression, or background alterations, while avoiding static image descriptions and staying concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on subtle human/object motion):**\nSubtle eye blinks. Slight torso rise and fall from breathing. Cake texture trembles. Gentle left-to-right camera zoom.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly more descriptive of changes):**\nEyes subtly blink, body imperceptibly breathes, cake surface gently jiggles, camera smoothly zooms left-to-right.\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasizing the *action* of change):**\nBlinking eyes. Breathing chest movement. Cake shimmers. Camera glides left.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The alligator cake suddenly rears its head, its eyes glowing fiercely as it lunges forward, mouth snapping open with a thunderous roar. Its body elongates rapidly, scales rippling violently, and its \"spines\" erupt into sharp, jagged projectiles that launch towards the viewer. The entire scene shakes with intense vibrations as the cake transforms into a monstrous, living creature.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The alligator cake slowly deflates, its eyes detaching and orbiting its head like planets. Cream filling bubbles upwards from its mouth, solidifying into tiny, edible clouds that drift away, pulling the cake with them as it floats off the plate and dissolves into shimmering dust.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, poised at a medium shot, slowly dollies forward, revealing the adorable green crocodile cake in stunning detail. A subtle, almost imperceptible quiver runs through the cake's body, hinting at life. A slow, dramatic zoom pushes in on its sugary eyes, which subtly blink, revealing tiny, dark pupils. The light slightly dims and then brightens, emphasizing the crocodile's playful form. As the camera circles the cake, we notice the subtle movement of tiny sprinkles on its back, a hint of texture. The full shot ending on a tight shot of the cakes gentle open mouth.",
