    "video_prompt": "Here are a few options, choose the one that best fits the desired level of detail for your model:\n\n**Option 1 (Most Concise):**\n\"A lone figure walks towards a colossal, glowing, decaying sci-fi megastructure in a vast, hazy, low-angle futuristic landscape, under a sky dominated by a giant gas planet. Warm orange and brown tones, reflective ground, emphasizing immense scale and mystery.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Detail):**\n\"Epic low-angle shot: A lone human figure, tiny on reflective ground, approaches a towering, intricate, decaying sci-fi megastructure, glowing intensely with warm orange light from its base. Giant, glowing ring structures surround it, under a hazy alien sky with a dominant gas giant. Palette of oranges, browns, and dark greys evoke wonder and discovery.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Focus on Composition/Feel):**\n\"Awe-inspiring vertical shot: A lone silhouetted figure faces a colossal, multi-layered megastructure, a fusion of ancient ruin and advanced city, emanating intense warm orange light from its base. The vast, hazy landscape includes curved, glowing ring-worlds and a giant celestial body in the distant sky. Low-angle perspective on reflective ground amplifies monumental scale and an ethereal, mysterious journey.\"",
    "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly longer to more concise, while retaining key details:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Evocative):**\n\"Awe-inspiring vast futuristic or fantastical landscape. Colossal central megastructure, an architectural fusion of ancient ruins, a decaying industrial city, and a towering organic tree, made of dark weathered metal with intricate gothic sci-fi details and spires reaching skyward. It is enveloped by massive, glowing ring-world structures. Dramatic low-angle, vertical composition. A lone, tiny, silhouetted human figure stands on reflective ground with tracks, gazing towards an intense, ethereal orange-yellow light emanating from an arched opening at the megastructure's base. The alien sky features a pale moon and a dominant reddish-brown gas giant. Rich palette of warm oranges, browns, dark grays, and muted greens. Hazy atmosphere, conveying immense scale, wonder, and isolation.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\"Vast, awe-inspiring, futuristic landscape. Colossal central megastructure, blending ancient ruins, decaying industrial city, and organic tree forms, in dark weathered metal with intricate sci-fi details. Surrounded by glowing ring-world structures. Low-angle, vertical shot. A lone, silhouetted human figure on reflective ground, facing an intense, ethereal orange-yellow light from the megastructure's base. Alien sky with pale moon and large reddish-brown gas giant. Warm orange, brown, dark gray, and muted green palette. Hazy atmosphere, emphasizing immense scale and wonder.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise - prioritizing core elements):**\n\"Awe-inspiring vast futuristic landscape. Colossal central megastructure (organic-industrial, decaying metal), surrounded by glowing ring-world structures. Low-angle, vertical composition. Lone, silhouetted human figure on reflective ground, facing an intense orange-yellow light from the megastructure's base. Alien sky with gas giant. Warm orange, brown, gray palette. Hazy atmosphere, immense scale.\"\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** Option 1 or 2 are likely best as they strike a good balance between conciseness and providing enough detail for the AI to generate a rich image. Option 1 is slightly preferred for its more evocative language like \"gothic sci-fi details\" and \"spires reaching skyward.\""
