    "video_prompt": "A light breeze rustles the palm tree leaves in the background. Subtle ripples appear on the surface of the water as the waves gently crash on the shore. The lime character's chest subtly rises and falls, simulating breathing, and its eyes occasionally blink. The straw in the drink ever so slightly sways. The shadow of the palm tree on the sand subtly shifts.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A cheerful, anthropomorphic cartoon lime character relaxing on a beach. The lime should be stylized with a smooth, bright green skin, resembling a large, perfectly round fruit. It has a wide, happy smile revealing white teeth, and small, subtly rounded arms that rest comfortably.\n\n**Outfit/Accessories:** The lime is wearing trendy, light green-framed sunglasses with dark lenses, slightly reflecting the sky. On its head, it sports a stylish, dark green fedora-style hat with a thin black band. One of its arms is holding a clear glass filled with a refreshing, light yellow-green beverage, garnished with a round slice of lime and two striped paper straws (green and white).\n\n**Setting:** The lime is comfortably seated in a miniature beach chair made of light natural wood with a blue and white striped fabric sling. The chair is positioned on a sun-drenched, sandy beach. The sand should be fine-grained and appear slightly textured.\n\n**Background:** In the midground, the serene, light turquoise-blue ocean stretches out, meeting a clear, bright blue sky with a few soft, faint white clouds. In the background, a large palm tree with a textured brown trunk and vibrant green fronds stands tall, partially out of focus, suggesting a tropical paradise.\n\n**Composition:** Medium close-up shot, with the lime and beach chair slightly off-center to the right, creating a balanced and inviting composition. The perspective is eye-level or slightly low, looking up at the lime.\n\n**Lighting:** Bright, natural sunlight hitting the scene from the upper left, creating subtle highlights on the lime's skin, sunglasses, and the drink, and casting soft shadows under the chair and lime. The overall feel should be warm and inviting.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Relaxed, joyful, tropical, and refreshing.\n\n**Style:** 3D digital art, high-resolution, photorealistic rendering with a slightly caricatured, playful aesthetic. Clean and crisp lines, vibrant colors, and detailed textures (e.g., on the lime's skin, sand, wood grain).\n\n**Additional details:** The bottom right of the image should subtly feature a logo/text \"c29\" in white, rounded sans-serif font.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Palm leaves sway gently. Water ripples expand as waves softly break. The lime character's chest subtly inflates and deflates, eyes occasionally flutter. The straw gently sways. A tree's shadow gradually lengthens.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The palm tree violently whips in a hurricane, leaves tearing. Gigantic waves violently crash, churning the water into a raging foam. The lime character hyperventilates, eyes bulging and blinking erratically. Suddenly, its arms flail, and the drink explodes, sending liquid and ice flying! The straw, contorting like a snake, whips around. The palm tree's shadow grotesquely stretches and shrinks at impossible speeds.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The palm tree sprouts a rainbow of leaves, swirling as the sky melts into a liquid ocean. The lime character's sunglasses warp into swirling vortexes, drawing tiny planets into its grinning mouth. The drink defies gravity, its contents dancing in a zero-G ballet, while the straw unravels into a shimmering serpent. The sand beneath them flows upwards, forming crystalline towers that shimmer and evaporate.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera swoops from the swaying palm, revealing the lime character's chest slowly rising. A dramatic zoom-in on its subtly blinking eyes before it grins, raising the drink as the straw sways. The camera glides down to the shore as delicate ripples appear and a singular wave breaks, then pans across the shifting palm shadow on the sand.",
