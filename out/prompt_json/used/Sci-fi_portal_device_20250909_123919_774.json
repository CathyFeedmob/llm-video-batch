    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the given image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA visually striking, grimdark, sci-fi dystopian landscape, highly detailed and rendered with cinematic lighting. The central focus is a massive, intricate, ornate clock-like or gauge-like structure, reminiscent of gothic Warhammer 40k architecture, suspended mid-air. It features spires, brass accents, and glowing digital readouts displaying data like \"10:38\" and \"UBG-\". A crosshair reticle is visible within its transparent, dark screen, which subtly reflects a distant, red-hued planet with an industrial structure on its surface.\n\nBelow the suspended device, thick, viscous, dark red organic matter or gore drips downwards, forming tendrils and lumps, leading to a fiery pyre or brazier on the blood-soaked ground. Flames erupt from this pyre, casting warm, hellish light upwards.\n\nThe foreground and midground are filled with a vast, chaotic army of armored, heavily-armed soldiers, reminiscent of Warhammer 40k Space Marines (some appear like Chaos Space Marines with glowing red eyes and spiked armor) and Imperial Guard, engaged in a massive battle. The ground is covered in pools and smears of blood and gore, suggesting intense conflict. Smoke and mist hang heavy in the air, adding to the oppressive atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, colossal, dark, industrial spacecraft or structures are visible in the murky sky, hinting at a vast, war-torn galaxy. The overall color palette is dominated by dark greys, deep reds, metallic bronze, and amber glows from the fire and digital displays. The lighting is dramatic and low-key, with strong contrasts between light and shadow. The composition is vertical, emphasizing the scale of the hanging device and the sprawling battlefield below.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize for generation:**\n\n*   **Genre/Style:** Grimdark, Sci-fi, Dystopian, Warhammer 40k aesthetic.\n*   **Central Object:** Large, ornate, gothic-sci-fi clock/gauge, suspended, dripping blood/gore, internal digital display with crosshairs.\n*   **Background:** Red planet with artificial structure, massive dark spaceships/structures in the sky.\n*   **Foreground/Midground:** Vast army of armored soldiers (Space Marine/Imperial Guard types), intense ground battle, blood/gore on ground.\n*   **Lighting/Atmosphere:** Cinematic, low-key, dramatic, hellish glow from fire, smoky battlefield, oppressive.\n*   **Colors:** Dominance of dark greys, deep reds, metallics, amber/orange glows.\n*   **Composition:** Vertical orientation, emphasis on scale.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera subtly zooms out. Pyre fire flickers and undulates. Metallic surfaces subtly shimmer and glint. Dark smoke wisps curl and drift. Red \"gore\" subtly pulsates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Central viewing device violently spasms, spewing torrents of gore as it rips free from its mounting, twisting grotesquely into an organic maw. Infernal fire explodes from the pyre, forming a sentient, clawing inferno that lunges at the viewer. Armored figures below surge into a frenzied, chaotic melee, weapons flashing with impossible speed, while distant battleships combust into searing nova. The very ground shudders and cracks, threatening to swallow the entire battlefield.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The central pyre's flames flicker wildly, reversing into liquid light that drains into the earth, coalescing into obsidian shards. The metallic viewing device oscillates, distending like molten glass, as red gore drips upwards, forming tendrils that reach into the sky, tethering to an unseen celestial body. Soldiers shimmer, their armor dissolving into shifting cosmic dust, as their forms are reabsorbed into the ground, leaving behind shimmering echoes. The distant planet pulses with an otherworldly luminescence, its surface rippling like disturbed water.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera subtly zooms out, revealing the vast battlefield. The central pyre's flames flicker wildly, casting dancing shadows. Light glints dynamically off the ornate viewing device and armored soldiers. Wisps of dark smoke curl and drift upward. The dripping 'gore' subtly pulsates, adding a visceral, unsettling rhythm. The camera then executes a sweeping pan across the charging army, settling on a close-up of a soldier's helmet as his eyes glow ominously.",
