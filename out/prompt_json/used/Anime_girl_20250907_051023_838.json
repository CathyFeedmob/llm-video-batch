    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The window glass shatters, shards exploding outward as torrents of rain blast inward. The woman's hair violently whips, entangled by gale-force winds. Her chest heaves in rapid, desperate gasps. Her eyes glow with piercing, otherworldly light, then abruptly vanish. The coffee cup melts into liquid metal, erupting in a molten geyser. Outside, cars levitate and crash, buildings ripple like water, and the street itself contorts with seismic fury.",

Her hair morphs into flowing ink tendrils, writing cryptic symbols on the air backwards. Her chest expands to reveal a cosmic nebula, exhaling stars.
