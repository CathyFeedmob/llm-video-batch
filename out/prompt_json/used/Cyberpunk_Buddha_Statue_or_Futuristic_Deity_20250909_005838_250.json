    "video_prompt": "Subtle light flickering on buildings and the statue, distant flying vehicles gently traverse the sky, emitted smoke from the train and building wafts softly, and faint steam rises from pipes.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Visual Elements:** A towering, ancient-looking statue of a multi-armed Buddhist deity (likely Guanyin or Cundi) as the central focus, crafted from weathered stone or metal, with glowing gold accents on its attire, crown, and ornaments. The statue is colossal, dominating the densely packed urban landscape. Surrounding the statue are intricate, multi-layered cyberpunk city structures: towering buildings with visible gears, pipes, scaffolding, and glowing neon signs in red, blue, and green. Elevated train tracks crisscross the mid-ground and foreground, with an old-style, dark green passenger train moving on them. Multiple futuristic flying vehicles, some emitting red light or smoke trails, traverse the sky at different altitudes. Steam and smoke emanate from various points in the city, including a prominent smokestack-like structure near the bottom right. Small figures of people are visible on the streets and platforms below. A large, illuminated \"C29\" sign hangs prominently near the lower right of the statue.\n\n**Style:** Cyberpunk meets ancient Asian mythology and industrial steampunk. Highly detailed, intricate, and a sense of verticality. A blend of aged, rugged textures with futuristic luminescence. The aesthetic evokes a lived-in, bustling, slightly dystopian future.\n\n**Composition:** A dynamic, slightly angled eye-level perspective looking down into a vast vertical cityscape. The large deity statue stands centrally, acting as a powerful focal point and anchor. The city structures frame the statue, creating a sense of immense scale and depth. The elevated train tracks and flying vehicles create leading lines and layers, guiding the eye through the scene. The composition is balanced but packed with visual information.\n\n**Colors:** Dominated by a warm, golden hour palette. Hazy, dusty orange and yellow tones fill the sky, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The city structures are primarily dark, rusted metallics, muted grays, and browns, providing a strong contrast to the bright neon lights. Accents of vibrant red, electric blue, and glowing green from the signs and vehicle lights stand out against the earthy tones. Gold details on the statue gleam.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused golden light from a setting or rising sun illuminating the top parts of the statue and distant skyscrapers. Strong, localized artificial lighting from neon signs, building windows, and vehicle lights creating pockets of glow and shadows. Light source in the background appears hazy, contributing to the atmospheric perspective.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Grand, awe-inspiring, mysterious, bustling, and slightly overwhelming. A powerful sense of scale and the passage of time, where ancient traditions meet advanced technology in a densely populated urban environment. A feeling of both grandeur and the grit of a lived-in, working city.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle light flickers on buildings and a statue. Distant flying vehicles gently traverse the sky. Smoke from a train and building softly wafts. Faint steam rises from pipes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings and giant statue lurch violently, lights strobe erratically. Steam and smoke erupt from pipes and train, billowing intensely skyward. Flying vehicles dart and weave erratically, crashing into each other. Fireballs erupt from rooftops, explosions rock the cyberpunk cityscape. The earth cracks beneath the train, sending sparks flying and debris catapulting as the train derails.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The colossal statue of Guanyin ever-so-slowly inhales the entire city, pulling buildings and trains into its glowing, internal void. Distant vehicles melt and reform into ethereal light beings that dance in reverse across the sky. Smoke and steam coalesce into crystalline filaments, weaving a delicate, impossible tapestry before dissolving into pure thought. Colors bleed from their forms, drifting like sentient clouds around the impossible scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, ethereal zoom out from the statue's serene face reveals the sprawling, cyberpunk city below. Distant flying vehicles glide silently across a hazy sunset sky as a train glides past, its steam gently rising. Subtle light flickers across buildings, hinting at untold stories within this ancient future.",
