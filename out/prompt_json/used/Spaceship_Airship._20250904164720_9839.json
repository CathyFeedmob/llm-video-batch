  "video_prompt": "A lone figure walks towards a colossal, hovering spacecraft descending with mechanical legs. Wind whips around the figure's hair and clothes as the craft's glowing elements fluctuate. Smaller flying vehicles move in the distant sky, while the ground, rendered with blueprint-like lines, suggests subtle topographical shifts. The scene transitions between detailed technical schematics and vibrant, cel-shaded rendering.",
  "image_prompt": "\"Awe-inspiring sci-fi concept art blending engineering blueprint details with vibrant anime illustration. A colossal, detailed white and grey hovering spacecraft with blue, red, and yellow accents (yellow/red core engine) dominates the frame, appearing as a cross-section/exploded view. Intricate mechanical legs descend towards a vast, blueprint-styled landscape with stylized trees and distant flying vehicles. In the foreground, a young woman with short white hair, wearing a yellow top and white shorts, walks confidently towards the spacecraft, emphasizing its immense scale. Wind ruffles her hair and shirt. The image perfectly merges technical drawing precision with imaginative, almost cel-shaded rendering.\"",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A figure strides forward, hair and clothes whipping in the wind. A colossal spacecraft descends, mechanical legs extending, as its glowing elements pulse. Distant flying vehicles traverse the sky. The ground's blueprint lines subtly undulate, indicating topographical shifts. The entire scene dynamically transitions between detailed technical schematics and vibrant cel-shaded rendering."
