    "video_prompt": "The enormous bagel in the foreground gently ripples its cream cheese 'water'. The figures in the bread-loaf building's windows subtly shift and converse. Overhead, the large bread loaves in the distance exhibit a very subtle, imperceptible breathing motion. The small boats on the cream cheese river bob slightly. The street lights in the tiny town below flicker softly. The green frosting on the donuts very slowly drips. Birds fly in the far distance in the sky.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical, highly detailed super wide shot of a fantastical city made of pastries, depicting a bustling miniature world. The central elements are towering buildings crafted from gigantic slices of bread, with visible interior levels bustling with tiny human figures. One such building, shaped like a sliced loaf of bread, has multiple floors acting as observation decks or balconies for the tiny people. Another prominent feature is a large, half-submerged bagel forming a waterway or canal filled with a light blue, gelatinous liquid, resembling water. Small, traditional wooden boats filled with tiny fruits and nuts navigate this 'waterway'.\n\nThe city's landscape includes numerous buildings and structures made from various bread products:\n- Stacked bagels form multi-story buildings, some topped with green-frosted donut-like roofs, reminiscent of moss or miniature gardens.\n- Smaller, round bread loaves or buns are used as foundations or parts of other structures.\n- A long, wavy piece of bagel forms a prominent 'river' or 'road', with people on its banks.\n\nThe overall scene is vibrant with deep, rich colors. The bread has a warm, golden-brown hue with visible crumbs and textures. The green frosting on some structures is a vivid, bright green, while the \"water\" is a clear, light blue. Subtle white sprinkles or sesame seeds are visible on the bagel and bun surfaces, adding texture and realism. Soft, warm lighting emanates from the windows of the bread buildings and from miniature streetlights, casting gentle glows and creating a cozy, almost enchanted evening atmosphere. Tiny human figures, dressed in various colorful clothing, are scattered throughout the scene, walking on streets, peering from buildings, and interacting, adding a sense of scale and life. The composition is dynamic, with various elements leading the eye around the vast and intricate scene. The atmosphere is playful and imaginative, like a miniature world brought to life.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The colossal bagel's cream cheese ripples. Figures in the bread-loaf building subtly shift and converse. Distant bread loaves subtly \"breathe.\" Small boats bob on the cream cheese river. Streetlights in the tiny town softly flicker. Green frosting drips from donuts. Birds fly in the distance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Dynamic Video Prompt:**\n\nThe enormous bagel in the foreground violently thrashes, sending cream cheese \"tsunamis\" crashing through the miniature city. The bread-loaf building's floors explode outwards, revealing frantic figures fleeing the collapsing structure. Overhead, the distant bread loaves grotesquely pulsate and contort. The small boats on the cream cheese river are violently capsized by the churning water, spilling their contents. The streetlights below dramatically spark and burst into flames, engulfing buildings. The green frosting on the donuts rapidly erupts and sprays outward like venom. A monstrous bread loaf rises from the distant horizon.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Cream cheese \"water\" vigorously churns, pulling the bagel-boat in a frantic whirlpool; passengers inside the bread-loaf building float upside down, their conversations echoing backwards. Distant bread loaves inflate and deflate like lungs, propelling themselves through the sky. Spectral birds soar into existence, leaving trails of light that reverse and coalesce back into the sky. Streetlights pulsate and stretch into impossible shapes. Green frosting solidifies then melts upwards, forming spiraling tendrils.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic zoom-in on the bagel building reveals figures gesturing wildly through the windows. The cream cheese river churns violently as the boats struggle against newfound currents. Overhead, colossal loaves undulate like monstrous beasts, casting shifting shadows. Streetlights flicker erratically. Green frosting oozes like toxic slime, accelerating its eerie descent. A single bird plummets from the distant sky.",
