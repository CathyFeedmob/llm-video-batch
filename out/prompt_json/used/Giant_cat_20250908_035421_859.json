    "video_prompt": "A giant tabby cat blinks slowly and breathes gently, its whiskers swaying subtly. Snowflakes drift down through the air, accumulating on the miniature village rooftops and trees. Two tiny skiers glide down the snowy slope. The lights inside the miniature houses flicker softly. A slow zoom out reveals the full scene.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical, surreal digital painting depicts a giant fluffy silver tabby cat, with striking greenish-yellow eyes and prominent ear tufts, partially visible on the left side of the frame. It gazes down at a miniature snowy village and ski slope below, creating a sense of immense scale contrast. The setting is a bright, clear winter day under a vibrant azure sky with softly falling snow creating a dreamy, slightly blurred effect in the background.\n\nThe miniature village features several quaint, traditional wooden houses with warm, glowing windows, nestled into a pristine, undulating snow-covered landscape. A dark wooden fence runs alongside some of the houses. In the foreground, two tiny, highly detailed human figures, dressed in red ski suits, are actively skiing down a white, textured slope that shows subtle ski tracks. Small, spiky evergreen trees are scattered throughout the snowy scene, adding to the wintery charm.\n\nThe lighting is natural and bright, highlighting the texture of the cat's fur and the sparkling snow. The color palette is dominated by cool blues and whites of the sky and snow, contrasted with the warm browns and yellows of the houses and the cat's eyes, and pops of red from the skiers. The composition places the large cat as an imposing, yet gentle, presence, with the miniature world meticulously detailed beneath it, conveying a playful and imaginative atmosphere. A subtle \"c29\" watermark is visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The giant tabby's eyelids slowly lower and rise. Gentle undulations ripple across its fur. Whiskers gradually shift. Snowflakes descend and accumulate. Tiny skiers move down the slope. Lights inside houses softly flicker. The entire scene recedes from view.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A colossal tabby cat ROARS, sending miniature houses tumbling! Violent gusts of wind whip through the village, scattering snowflakes everywhere. Skiers are flung airborne as the snow-covered slope SHIFTS and CRACKS. Buildings EXPLODE inwards, lights flickering wildly, as the cat's paw CRASHES down, creating an avalanche of debris. The entire scene ERUPTS into chaos!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A giant tabby cat, made of swirling snow, slowly melts into a river that flows upwards. The miniature village houses float into the sky, transforming into glowing snowflakes. Skiers on liquid skis ripple through the air, their tracks forming iridescent ribbons that unravel backward. The entire scene pulsates with an ethereal glow, defying dimension.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms in on a colossal tabby cat's eye as it slowly blinks, a single snowflake catching on its long whisker before dissolving. The lens sweeps down to reveal two miniature skiers, one veering sharply, kicking up a plume of snow. A swift pan across the illuminated miniature village highlights the gentle flicker of lights within the tiny houses, casting dancing shadows. The camera then smoothly tilts up and away, revealing the immense scale of the cat nestled amongst the snow-covered slopes and village, as soft snowflakes continue to fall.",
