    "video_prompt": "A gentle shimmer appears on the clear candy roof beads. The small sugary squares on the ground subtly wiggle. The vibrant colors of the background spheres appear to softly glow and subtly shift.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, whimsical close-up shot of a miniature gingerbread house made entirely of colorful, sugar-dusted gummy candies and adorned with clear, sparkling \"roof tiles\" that resemble gumdrops. The house features a bright pink door with a green frame and a small yellow doorknob, and a white window frame with a green cross. The house is surrounded by a charming path and landscape also made from various shapes and colors of gummy candies, including square, round, and irregular shapes in shades of pink, yellow, blue, and orange. Some candies have textured or sugar-coated surfaces. The background is softly blurred, showing out-of-focus large, colorful spheres in pastel hues, suggesting a playful and dreamlike setting. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the translucent qualities of the candy and the sparkle of the clear roof tiles. The overall atmosphere is sweet, inviting, and magical. A subtle watermark \"c29\" is in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Composition:** Close-up, slightly low angle, focusing on the gingerbread house and the immediate candy landscape around it. Rule of thirds applies to the house placement.\n**Style:** Whimsical, fairytale, confectionery art.\n**Colors:** Predominantly bright and pastel gummy colors (pink, yellow, orange, blue, green), with white and clear accents.\n**Lighting:** Soft, bright, diffused, highlighting the candy textures and translucency.\n**Atmosphere:** Sweet, playful, magical, enchanting, inviting.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The clear candy roof beads erupt in a blinding, explosive shimmer, shattering into a hail of glittering shrapnel. Suddenly, the small sugary squares on the ground violently convulse, launching into a chaotic, swirling vortex of color. Simultaneously, the vibrant background spheres pulsate with an infernal glow, rapidly expanding and contracting with violent bursts of light. The entire candy landscape shakes and shudders, on the verge of collapsing into a sugary maelstrom!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The clear candy roof beads stretch into opalescent coils, dripping liquid light. Sugary ground squares lift and dissolve into sparkling dust, reforming into spectral flora that hums with unheard melodies. Background spheres ripple, their colors bleeding outwards to construct a shifting, gravity-defying aurora that engulfs the entire scene, morphing the house into a fractal of pure joy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically tilts down from the subtly glowing background spheres, focusing sharply on the intricate candy house. A gentle shimmer ripples across the clear roof beads as a sweeping pan reveals the sugary squares below beginning to subtly wiggle, creating a mesmerizing wave-like motion. The camera slowly pushes in, highlighting the vibrant colors and playful movement, ending on a soft, ethereal glow settling over the entire edible landscape.",
