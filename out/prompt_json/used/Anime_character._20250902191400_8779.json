  "video_prompt": "A tall anime man's long silver hair gently sways. His intense red eyes subtly shift, and his serious, aloof expression subtly evolves. His loose red tie and open black trench coat softly flutter. The abstract black and white background continually swirls and smears, with sharp contrasting edges dynamically appearing and fading. Prominent red, green, and blue glitch effects constantly flicker, distorting across the character and environment. Chromatic aberration pulsates around edges, enhancing a sense of digital corruption and a shifting, dramatic light.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\nFull body illustration of a tall, slender male character in an anime style. He has long white hair, pale skin, piercing red eyes with sharp pupils, and a mysterious, serious expression looking down. He wears a black choker with a metallic charm, a cross earring, and finger rings. His outfit: unbuttoned white shirt, loose red patterned tie, silver chain necklace with blue gemstone, oversized open black trench coat with ornate gothic designs, loose black trousers with a belt and silver chains, black dress shoes, silver ankle chain. One hand in pocket.\n\nThe background is abstract, chaotic black and white paint strokes, overlaid with prominent red, green, blue glitch effects, digital distortion, and strong chromatic aberration. Cyberpunk, vaporwave aesthetic. High contrast, dramatic lighting. Full body, center-left composition.",
