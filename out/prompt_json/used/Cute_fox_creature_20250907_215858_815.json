    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on recreating the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA highly detailed, highly stylized close-up portrait of a fantastical fox-like creature, rendered in a hyperrealistic style with a strong sense of soft, volumetric lighting. The creature has rich orange-brown fur with distinct white and grey markings on its face and neck, with a shimmering, almost iridescent quality. Its large, expressive golden-orange eyes are the central focus, filled with a gentle, reflective light. Glistening golden glitter or flecks are strategically applied around its eyes and across some areas of its fur, catching the light like scattered jewels.\n\nSeveral clear, thin streams of water or liquid continuously flow down vertically across the foreground, appearing to drip directly from above and lightly interact with the creature's fur, creating small ripples and wet glints where they meet the surface, especially around the eyes, suggesting tears or a magical effect. Tiny, sparkling orbs of golden light (bokeh) are scattered throughout the scene, particularly in the background, creating a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere.\n\nThe composition is a tight, medium close-up, focusing on the creature's face from the eyes down to its chest, slightly angled. A golden tassel charm hangs visibly on the left side of the frame, near the creature's ear or collar. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, dominated by oranges, golds, and soft whites/greys, contrasted by moments of dark, deep blues in the background, possibly indicating a nighttime or mystical setting. The lighting is soft and glowing, with noticeable rim lighting outlining the fur, enhancing its texture and volume.\n\n**Art Styles:** Hyperrealism, mystical art, fantasy art, digital painting.\n\n**Additional details (if allowed by generator):**\n* **Camera Angle:** Eye-level or slightly looking up.\n* **F-Stop:** Shallow depth of field to emphasize the creature's face and the streaming water, blurring the background bokeh.\n* **Shutter Speed:** Fast, to capture the clarity of the flowing water.\n* **Lens:** Possibly a macro lens for detail and subject isolation.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Shimmering dust motes drift and coalesce. Water droplets fall and ripple outwards. The fox's gaze subtly shifts, its eyes tracking. Glimmers of gold on its fur softly expand and recede.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Golden dust motes erupt, swirling into a blinding vortex. Water droplets violently lash the air, coalescing into thorny spikes that pierce the ground. The fox's eyes snap, pupils dilating, its head whipping to track unseen threats. Gold fur shimmers with an internal, flickering combustion, hinting at explosive transformation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Sparkling dust motes drift and shimmer, water droplets fall then ascend, the fox's eyes subtly follow through time-reversal and reflection. Gold accents on the fox's fur softly glint as if absorbing light, then melt and reform into liquid gold flowing uphill. Tail fur shifts into a cascading waterfall, then solidifies into shimmering geodes. The fox's ears gently unfurl into iridescent wings, beating rhythmically in defiance of air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A close-up shot of the fox's face. The camera gradually tracks upward, revealing shimmering gold dust motes falling like gentle rain. Water droplets cascade down, creating subtle ripples on the fur. The fox's eyes, wide and luminous, slowly track left, then right, as the camera dramatically zooms into one eye, capturing the reflected sparkle. The gold accents on the fur catch the light with a soft, ethereal glow.",
