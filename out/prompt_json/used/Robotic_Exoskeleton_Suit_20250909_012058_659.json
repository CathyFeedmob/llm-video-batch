    "video_prompt": "Subtle sway of the massive robotic legs, light glinting on the metallic surface as if shifting slightly, the woman's hair softly moving as if a gentle breeze passes, the green interior lights subtly pulsing or flickering.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed and concise image generation prompt to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Full Prompt:**\n\n\"A highly detailed, cinematic shot of a futuristic bipedal mech suit on the moon, piloted by a sleek, confident woman in a black latex suit. The mech is predominantly reflective dark silver and black, with glowing vibrant green internal circuitry and holographic displays visible through transparent panels. The cockpit is a bubble-like enclosure, showcasing the pilot seated. The mech stands firmly on a desolate lunar surface with visible craters and rocks, under a stark, dark space sky. In the background, a minimalist white lunar base structure is partially visible on the left, and a large, dark planet or moon is subtly present on the right horizon. The lighting is sharp, creating strong reflections on the metallic surfaces and emphasizing the green glow. The style is hyperrealistic and sci-fi art, with a focus on polished textures and intricate details. Shot as a medium-full shot, capturing the full scale of the mech and its environment. Artificial intelligence generative art on the top left corner, and the text 'c29' on the bottom right corner\"\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Futuristic bipedal mech suit, piloted by a woman.\n*   **Pilot Appearance:** Sleek, confident woman, black latex suit.\n*   **Mech Appearance:** Predominantly reflective dark silver and black, glowing vibrant green internal circuitry, holographic displays, transparent panels, bubble-like cockpit.\n*   **Setting:** Desolate lunar surface (moonscape with craters/rocks), stark dark space sky.\n*   **Background Details:** Minimalist white lunar base structure (left), large dark planet/moon (right horizon).\n*   **Lighting:** Sharp, strong reflections, emphasized green glow.\n*   **Style:** Hyperrealistic, cinematic, sci-fi art, polished textures, intricate details.\n*   **Composition/Shot Type:** Medium-full shot, vertical orientation, capturing full scale of mech and environment.\n*   **Additional Elements:** \"AI 生成\" text (top left), \"c29\" text (bottom right).",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle mechanical undulations ripple through the robotic legs. Light shimmers and dances across the metallic surface. The woman's hair gently sways in an invisible breeze. Green interior lights pulse and flicker rhythmically.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "CRASH! The hulking mech violently shifts, legs buckling, sending a cascade of moon dust scattering. The polished metal exterior screeches as panels grind, revealing sparking internal mechanisms. Suddenly, the serene green interior lights riotously explode in errant flashes, illuminating the pilot's hair whipping wildly as if caught in a sudden, violent updraft. The previously static moon rocks jolt and tumble, a minor seismic event echoing the mech's thrashing. Explosive energy radiates from the shaking machine.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity warps, pulling the metallic legs skyward, while the woman's hair unravels into glowing data streams. Green interior lights blossom into fractal forests, their leaves breathing starlight. The moon's surface ripples like liquid, absorbing the mech's impossible steps, transforming into a kaleidoscope of fleeting colors as the entire scene dissolves into an echoing, silent dream.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Push in on the woman's determined face, the green lights casting an otherworldly glow. A slow, sweeping pan reveals the massive metallic legs begin to step, each movement a thunderous *thrum*. The ground shudders as the mech strides forward, dust rising slowly. A dramatic low-angle shot emphasizes the colossal scale, as a shadowy lunar mountain looms in the background, subtly darkening the scene.",
