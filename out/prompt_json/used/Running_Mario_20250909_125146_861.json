    "video_prompt": "A subtle, slow pan of the camera, tracking with Mario as if he's running against the wind. The colorful particles gently shimmer and float outwards, varying in intensity. The vibrant light trails behind Mario subtly pulse and undulate as if he's generating them with his speed.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-energy, vibrant digital illustration of Super Mario running mid-air from left to right, propelled by a burst of colorful light trails and exploding confetti. The background is a soft, bright blue and white gradient creating an expansive, upward dynamic.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Super Mario:** Iconic red cap with \"M\" logo, blue overalls, red long-sleeved shirt, white gloves, brown shoes, and a classic excited expression. He is depicted in a dynamic running pose, with his arms and legs actively moving. His 3D rendering is smooth and slightly glossy, almost like a vinyl toy.\n*   **Light Trails/Energy Streaks:** Emanating from behind Mario, a complex network of luminous, flowing lines in various bright colors – magenta, purple, orange, yellow, green, and blue – twisting and intertwining. These streaks are thick and appear to pulsate with light, indicating speed and dynamic force.\n*   **Confetti/Particles:** Billions of small, brightly colored shapes (circles, squares, irregular blobs) are scattered throughout the image, especially concentrated on the left side and along the light trails. Some are in sharp focus, others are gently blurred, creating depth of field and a sense of movement. The colors are highly saturated.\n*   **Text (top left):** Chinese characters \"AI 生成\" (AI Generated), small and subtle.\n*   **Text (bottom right):** Stylized \"C29®\" in a brushstroke font, fading from blue to purple, with a small registered trademark symbol.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Digital illustration with a clean, polished, and somewhat playful aesthetic.\n*   3D rendering for Mario, giving him volume and smooth surfaces.\n*   Abstract, energetic, and dynamic background elements.\n*   High level of detail on Mario's character model.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Full body shot of Mario, positioned off-center to the right, creating a sense of movement towards the empty space on the right.\n*   Diagonal flow from the bottom left to the top right, created by the light trails and confetti, enhancing the impression of upward and forward motion.\n*   Strong leading lines from the colorful energy trails guiding the eye towards Mario.\n*   Open, bright negative space on the right side of the canvas.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Bright reds, blues, purples, magentas, oranges, yellows, and greens for the light trails and confetti.\n*   **Mario's Palette:** Classic primary red and blue, with white, brown, and skin tones.\n*   **Background:** Soft, light blue and off-white/beige gradient, creating a clean backdrop for the vibrant foreground.\n*   High saturation and luminosity throughout.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Bright, even, and slightly dramatic general lighting, suggesting an artificial or studio light setup.\n*   Soft shadows on Mario, defining his form without harshness.\n*   The light trails themselves emanate glowing light, illuminating the surrounding particles.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Joyful, energetic, optimistic, and fast-paced. Conveys excitement and positive momentum.\n\nPrompt structure:\n`[Subject/Character description], [Action/Pose], [Key visual elements and their properties], [Background details], [Lighting], [Color palette], [Art style/Medium], [Atmosphere/Mood], [Camera angle/Composition].`\n\n**Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n```\nA full-body, dynamic digital illustration of Super Mario running mid-air from the left, composed towards the right side of the frame, with an excited expression. He wears his iconic red cap with the 'M' logo, blue overalls, red shirt, and white gloves. Emanating from behind and beneath him are vibrant, luminous energy streaks and swirling colorful confetti particles in magenta, purple, orange, yellow, green, and blue, creating a powerful sense of speed and forward motion. The background is a clean, bright light blue to off-white gradient sky. The style is 3D rendered, playful, and highly polished, with soft shadows and glowing elements. The overall atmosphere is energetic, joyful, and optimistic. Wide shot, upward diagonal composition.\n```",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The camera subtly and slowly pans, tracking Mario as if pushing against an unseen force. Colorful particles gently shimmer and float outwards, their intensity fluctuating. Vibrant light trails behind Mario subtly pulse and undulate, appearing generated by his motion.",

    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A camera levitates inverse to Mario, who races up a waterfall of shimmering, reverse-flowing light. Colorful particles, defying gravity, coalesce into impossible dimensions, then invert into echoing voids. His speed warps the air into liquid rainbows, each ripple defying physics, pulling dreamlike forms from the void before dissolving into impossible echoes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dynamic camera lunges forward, a rapid push-in to a dramatic medium shot of Mario, his face determined as he leans into an invisible gale. The camera then performs a sweeping crane movement, rising to reveal the shimmering, wind-blown particles momentarily slowing like glitter in syrup before bursting outwards. Concurrently, the vibrant light trails behind Mario intensify, pulsing rapidly, almost organically, as a final hyper-zoom captures his triumphant sprint into the distance.",
