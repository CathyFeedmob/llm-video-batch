    "video_prompt": "A subtle left-to-right camera drift, the lead soldier's chest subtly rising and falling with breath, minor glints of light reflecting off their helmet and weapon as they move, snow flurries dancing in the air, a faint ripple of heat haze rising from the distant landscape.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot of a tactical soldier in a desolate, snowy, and slightly rocky landscape, walking towards the viewer from the right. The soldier is equipped with a heavily armored, futuristic-military outfit in muted olive green and dark grey tones. They wear a full-face combat helmet with a dark visor and a detailed, segmented lower face mask, giving a menacing, determined expression despite the covered face. Over their uniform, they have layered tactical vests and chest rigs with pouches, and elbow and knee pads providing extra protection. A modern assault rifle is held across their body, angled downwards, with their hands securely gripping it. A subtle red indicator or highlight is visible on the rifle. On their back, a specialized, high-tech backpack is visible, with hints of a mechanical arm or weapon attachment extending upwards. Another soldier, slightly out of focus, is visible behind the main subject, also dressed in similar tactical gear, receding into the background on the left. The ground is covered in white, undisturbed snow with subtle ripples and small rocks. The background features blurred, dark, industrial or futuristic structures hinting at a war-torn environment, with hints of muted red and orange light emanating from them.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n* **Subject:** Tactical soldier, front-facing, walking.\n* **Clothing/Gear:** Futuristic military uniform, combat helmet, dark visor, segmented face mask, tactical vest, chest rig, elbow and knee pads, specialized backpack (with mechanical arm/weapon).\n* **Weapon:** Modern assault rifle with red highlight.\n* **Background Figures:** Another soldier, slightly out of focus.\n* **Environment:** Desolate, snowy, rocky landscape.\n* **Background Structures:** Blurred, dark, industrial/futuristic structures.\n\n**Style:**\n* **Art Style:** Digital painting, detailed illustration, semi-realistic but with a stylized, almost graphic novel aesthetic.\n* **Artistic Influence:** Possibly reminiscent of concept art from tactical video games (e.g., *Ghost Recon*, *Escape from Tarkov*, *Crysis* for the futuristic elements).\n\n**Composition:**\n* **Perspective:** Full shot, low-angle perspective, emphasizing the soldier's imposing presence.\n* **Framing:** Soldier placed slightly off-center to the right, leading the eye into the scene.\n* **Depth of Field:** Shallow, with the foreground soldier sharp and the background softly blurred, creating depth.\n* **Leading Lines:** The soldier's posture and the rifle create subtle diagonal lines.\n\n**Colors:**\n* **Dominant Color Palette:** Muted olive green, dark grey, black, and white.\n* **Accents:** Subtle reds/oranges from the distant structures and the rifle detail.\n* **Snow:** Bright white with cool grey shadows.\n* **Sky (implied):** Overcast or dark, contributing to the somber atmosphere.\n\n**Lighting:**\n* **Type:** Diffused, overcast lighting, suggesting a cloudy day or early morning/late evening.\n* **Source:** Appears to be ambient light from above.\n* **Shadows:** Soft, natural shadows on the snow and gear, adding dimension.\n* **Atmospheric:** Hints of distant glow from industrial structures.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n* **Mood:** Gritty, serious, vigilant, somewhat bleak and isolated.\n* **Sense:** Implies a post-apocalyptic or active combat zone.\n* **Feeling:** Professional, determined, and prepared for conflict.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle left camera drift. Soldier's chest rising/falling. Helmet and weapon subtly glinting. Snow flurries dancing. Distant heat haze rippling.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Cataclysmic tremor as the ground splinters, sending the lead soldier reeling! Their weapon blasts a blinding muzzle flash. Snow erupts into a violent blizzard, swirling into spectral forms. Distant structures twist and contort, their forms warping unnaturally. The sky rips open, revealing a pulsating vortex as arcane energy discharges.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A subtle left-to-right camera drift, the lead soldier's chest subtly rising and falling with breath, minor glints of light reflecting off their helmet and weapon as they move, snow flurries dancing in the air, a faint ripple of heat haze rising from the distant landscape.\n\n**Surreal/Impossible Prompt:**\n\nA subtle left-to-right camera drift as the lead soldier's chest expands, exhaling spectral wind that pulls the distant snow flurries backwards into a swirling, black hole. Their weapon dissolves into a flock of shimmering butterflies that orbit their helmet, which then inverts into a miniature, rotating galaxy, shimmering with impossible light. The soldier levitates, their boot prints in the snow reversing, swallowing the light as they float upward into the sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone, armored soldier trudges through a blizzard, footsteps crunching in the snow. The camera dramatically tracks their solemn advance, their breath misting in the frigid air. A sudden, tight zoom reveals the determined glint in their visor, a fleeting reflection of barren, snow-covered landscape. A faint, almost imperceptible tremor of the ground hints at an unseen threat, as the camera subtly pans down to reveal a faint, red glow from beneath the snow, ominous and unexplained.",
