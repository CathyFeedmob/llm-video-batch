    "video_prompt": "Subtle breathing motion in the chest and shoulders. Eyes softly blink. A very slight, slow zoom out with minimal camera roll.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, Cubist-inspired painting of a woman in a frontal, slightly tilted pose within a vertical portrait orientation. The artwork features bold, thick black outlines segmenting the subject into numerous geometric shapes – triangles, rectangles, and irregular polygons.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nThe woman's face is rendered with distinct features: two blue eyes, one appearing almost frontal and the other in profile, a sharp, angular nose in profile, and bright red lips forming a narrow, horizontal line. Her complexion is divided into areas of white and light pink. Her hair is a cascade of red, blue, and yellow geometric shapes. She wears a small, circular yellow earring on her visible ear. Her body is also fragmented into similar geometric shapes, with dominant colors of red, blue, yellow, white, and purple for her clothing and skin.\n\n**Style:**\nCubist, Pop Art influence, with distinct flat color blocks and strong linear definitions. The brushstrokes are visible, creating a textured, hand-painted feel, particularly evident in the background and within color blocks. The style is reminiscent of Picasso's synthetic cubism, but with a brighter, more graphic sensibility.\n\n**Composition:**\nThe woman occupies the majority of the vertical frame, centered. The background is a flat, muted blue-grey, also broken into large, subtle geometric planes with visible hatched brushstrokes. The signature \"c229\" in orange and white is located in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Colors:**\nHigh-contrast and saturated: primary reds, blues, and yellows are prominent, complemented by white, light pink, and purple. Black outlines provide strong separation and definition. The background is a cool, muted blue-grey.\n\n**Lighting:**\nFlat, even lighting that emphasizes the geometric forms and bold colors, with no discernible light source or shadows within the figures.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nModern, artistic, vibrant, and abstract. The overall impression is one of striking visual energy and a stylized interpretation of a human figure.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle breathing with chest and shoulder rise and fall. Soft, natural blinks. Minimal, slow zoom out with imperceptible camera roll.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Focus on the face. Eyes dart unpredictably, pupils rapidly dilating. The jaw clenches and releases, a subtle snarl building. The head twists sharply, then jerks back. Colors intensify and shift with each sudden movement. Background shards detach and collide with chaotic force. The entire canvas shudders and vibrates aggressively, threatening to tear apart!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The geometric facial planes melt and ooze, reforming into vibrant, pulsating, disembodied eyes that orbit the head like satellites. The black outlines shiver and expand, briefly revealing a swirling nebula. The earrings detach and float upwards, elongating into luminous strands that entwine the hair, which itself begins to ripple like water. The chest cavity opens, revealing an impossible garden of bioluminescent flora that sways with an internal breeze. The colors intensely shift hues, bathing the scene in an ethereal glow, while the entire construct slowly zooms out, revealing it's merely a floating fragment within a cosmic kaleidoscope.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, deliberate zoom-out reveals more of the stark, abstract environment. The figure's chest gently rises and falls, a subtle sign of life amidst the geometric rigidity. Her piercing blue eyes blink languidly, suggesting a quiet contemplation or perhaps a dawning realization. A soft, dynamic rotation of the camera enhances the sense of discovery, subtly shifting perspective to reveal the interplay of light and shadow, and the dramatic angles of her form.",
