    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a fierce, beautiful female warrior, likely a general or leader, with long dark hair styled in an elaborate bun and braids, adorned with intricate golden hairpins. She is riding a magnificent, mythical East Asian-inspired creature resembling a powerful, horned dragon-ox.\n\n**Visual Elements & Character:**\n*   **Female Warrior:** Young, strong, and determined expression. Dressed in ornate, dark green and gold armor with bronze-like accents. Her armor features detailed gold filigree and dragon-like motifs on the shoulder pads and chest plate, with smaller details on her bracers. She wears practical but decorative boots. Her left hand rests on the creature's back, while her right hand firmly grips a formidable, bone-like bladed weapon (resembling a large, ornate glaive or polearm) with a sharp, metallic spearhead. The blade portion has etched characters or symbols. A sword in a scabbard is visible at her hip. Red ribbons or sashes are wrapped around parts of her armor and trail behind her.\n*   **Mythical Creature:** Large, powerful quadruped with a sturdy, muscular build. Its hide is a deep, textured greenish-bronze color, resembling scales. It has two large, curved golden horns and a prominent, ornate golden faceplate with large, slightly bulging yellow eyes and a detailed snout featuring red whiskers or tendrils emanating from below its nose. Its mouth is wide open, revealing sharp teeth and a red tongue. The creature has thick, strong legs ending in clawed feet. Intricate golden harness and saddle straps adorn its back.\n*   **Composition:** Dynamic, eye-level shot looking steeply up at the warrior and creature as they advance forward, creating a sense of power and dominance. The creature occupies a large portion of the lower and central frame, with the warrior positioned elegantly atop it. The background shows hints of a vast, populated cityscape or encampment, with structures and distant figures.\n*   **Background & Environment:** Overcast or diffused sky, suggesting an epic, potentially stormy, or dust-filled setting. Buildings with traditional East Asian architectural elements (pagodas, market stalls) are visible in the mid-ground. A long, wide staircase or ramp leads up towards the background, populated by a multitude of background figures, giving a sense of a large army or gathering. Scattered skulls and weapon fragments (like a broken staff or spear) lie on the ground in the foreground, indicating a recent battle or a path of destruction.\n*   **Colors:** Predominantly muted earth tones, moss greens, and bronze metallics, contrasted with rich gold accents and occasional vibrant reds (from the ribbons/sashes and the creature's tongue/whiskers). The sky is a subdued blue-grey.\n*   **Lighting:** Diffused, atmospheric lighting, giving a slightly dramatic and heavy feel. Highlights emphasize the metallic elements of the armor and creature's adornments. Soft shadows define forms and depth.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Epic fantasy, serious, powerful, and slightly dark. Evokes ancient East Asian mythology and warfare. Sense of a leader leading forces into or after conflict.\n\n**Style:** Digital painting, highly detailed, realistic with a strong fantastical element. Brushstrokes are visible on closer inspection, giving a painterly quality despite the high detail. Inspired by traditional East Asian art combined with modern fantasy illustration.\n\n**Artist Influence (Optional, but can help guide style):** Loish, Ruan Jia, or similar artists known for dynamic figures and rich detail in fantasy settings.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Warriors ribbons and hair gently sway. Monster's eyes subtly blink, smoke unfurls from nostrils. Subtle camera zoom in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The warrior's ribbons violently whip, her hair lashes. The monster's eyes snap wide, smoke bursts from its nostrils. The camera rapidly zooms in. Red banners rip, debris explodes. Skulls shatter, cracked ground trembles. The very air pulses with raw, unbound energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The warrior's ribbons and hair become sentient tentacles, lashing wildly against an invisible force. The monster's eyes detach and float, morphing into swirling galaxies, exhaling constellations of smoke. The ground beneath them ripples into liquid, reflecting impossible inverted skies as the camera, itself a conscious entity, disassembles into pure light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The warrior's ribbons and hair softly sway. The monster's eyes subtly blink, and whisps of smoke curl from its nostrils. Slight camera zoom in.\n\nDramatic slow zoom from a wide shot, showcasing the bustling market behind. As the camera tracks forward, red ribbons on the warrior's back flutter intensely, revealing ornate armor. The monster she rides emits a deep growl, its eyes glowing faintly as it snorts, sending plumes of smoke curling upwards. The camera continues to slowly move, adding to the drama.",
