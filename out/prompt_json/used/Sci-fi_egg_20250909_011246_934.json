    "video_prompt": "Subtle golden light flicker and glow from the internal mechanisms, soft hum and vibration of the internal machinery, very slow and gentle rotation of the entire egg, slight camera zoom in and out.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, futuristic Faberge egg, resembling a mechanical and technological marvel. The egg is split into two main sections: the top part is a smooth, matte red, while the bottom section is black with intricate golden and bronze internal mechanisms exposed, giving it a steampunk or cyberpunk aesthetic.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Egg Structure:** The egg has a distinct split, red on top, black on the bottom. The black part is segmented with visible fasteners and panel lines.\n*   **Internal Mechanisms:** The exposed interior of the black section reveals a dense array of golden and bronze pipes, gears, wires, and glowing elements. There are circular, metallic structures with glowing centers, suggestive of power sources or lenses.\n*   **Details:** Small rivets, screws, vents, and glowing indicator lights dot the surface. Some black panels have subtle red accents.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Genre:** Blends steampunk, cyberpunk, and futuristic design.\n*   **Realism:** Highly realistic rendering with meticulous attention to material textures and intricate details.\n*   **Aesthetics:** Industrial, mechanical, sophisticated, and luxurious.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Subject:** The egg is the central and dominant subject, placed slightly left of center.\n*   **Angle:** Eye-level shot, slightly from below, emphasizing the grandeur and complexity of the object.\n*   **Foreground:** The golden text \"C29\" is positioned in the bottom right corner, casting a subtle shadow, balancing the composition.\n*   **Background:** A clean, plain, light grey background allows the egg to stand out without distraction.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Primary:** Dominant colors are deep red, matte black, and various shades of gold and bronze.\n*   **Accents:** Subtle orange and yellow glows emanate from the internal mechanisms.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Type:** Soft, even studio lighting.\n*   **Direction:** Appears to be illuminated from the front and slightly above, creating clear definition and subtle shadows.\n*   **Effects:** The internal golden elements emit a warm, soft glow, adding depth and visual interest. Reflections are visible on metallic surfaces, indicating polished materials.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Sophisticated, mysterious, technologically advanced, and a hint of opulence.\n*   **Feeling:** Evokes curiosity about the internal workings and purpose of the object.\n\n**Extra Details to include:**\n*   The Chinese characters \"AI 生成\" present in the top left corner.\n\n**Undesired Elements:**\n*   No other objects or distractions.\n*   No rough or unpolished textures.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The internal mechanisms subtly flicker and glow with an ethereal light. The egg gently rotates, causing the light to shimmer. The camera slowly zooms, enhancing the soft vibration and hum emanating from within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent internal mechanisms burst forth, ejecting sparks and shards in every direction. The egg itself convulses, jerking erratically, then slams down, creating fissures in the ground. Golden energy pulses outwardly in sudden, blinding flashes, accompanied by deafening, grinding roars. The egg rapidly transforms, panels shifting and reconfiguring at high speed, revealing new, glowing apertures that rapidly open and close.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "**Video Prompt:**\nThe egg floats, shimmering as internal gears spin counter-clockwise, simultaneously pulling apart and reassembling into golden butterflies that flutter into impossible negative space. Gravity reverses, drawing the butterflies back into the egg, which inverts its own colors, the red bleeding into chrome and the black into a radiant gold. All moves in slow-motion reverse, time folding in on itself.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, sweeping camera encircles the glowing, humming egg, revealing intricate golden mechanisms. A dramatic zoom-in highlights a subtle golden light flicker, emphasizing the internal processes. The egg slowly rotates, its soft vibration barely perceptible. As the camera subtly zooms out, a feeling of anticipation builds.",
