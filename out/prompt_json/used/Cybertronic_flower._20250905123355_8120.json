  "video_prompt": "A futuristic metallic flower's petals subtly open and close, revealing glowing internal mechanisms. Teal-blue light pulses from its core, reflecting off polished surfaces. Wavy, teal energy lines flicker dynamically in the background. Subtle shadows shift with the metallic flower's movements.",
  "image_prompt": "High-resolution 3D render of a futuristic, metallic flower. Sleek silver and gray petals with layered, hinged structures emit vibrant teal-blue light from internal strips and a glowing cylindrical core. Subtle bolts and panel lines detail the polished surface. A smooth, neutral gray background features generative teal-blue energy lines, emphasizing the high-tech, industrial-organic aesthetic. Dramatic lighting accentuates reflections and depth.",
