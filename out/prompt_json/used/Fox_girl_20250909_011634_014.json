    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nAnime-style illustration of a fierce and alluring kitsune woman. She has vibrant, reddish-brown hair styled in loose waves, paired with large, fluffy fox ears that are brown with white inner fur and black tips. Her eyes are a striking, glowing red, conveying an intense and powerful gaze. She wears a dark, possibly off-shoulder top or dress with white trim and fur details around the shoulders. A prominent golden bell on a red and black studded collar adorns her neck. Multiple large, fluffy fox tails (at least two visible) emanate from her back, exhibiting shades of reddish-brown and white. Silver chains are intricately wrapped around her body, arms, and drift freely around her, suggesting a captivating yet constrained presence. Her legs are visible, clad in light-colored, fitted footwear or wraps.\n\n**Style:**\nDynamic anime illustration with sharp lines, detailed character design, and a blend of realistic textures (fur) and stylized elements. The aesthetic leans towards a dark fantasy or mythological theme.\n\n**Composition:**\nFull-body portrait, shot from a low-angle looking upwards, making the character appear dominant and powerful. Her gaze is directed straight at the viewer, drawing them in. The chains create leading lines, adding depth and visual interest. The background is somewhat blurred, emphasizing the character.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are rich reddish-browns (hair, tails), stark whites (fur, trim), deep blacks/dark grays (clothing, background shadows), and vibrant glowing red (eyes). Accents of gold (bell) and silver (chains) provide metallic contrast.\n\n**Lighting:**\nDramatic and high-contrast lighting. A strong, ethereal light source seems to emanate from below and behind the character, casting soft glows on her fur and hair, and creating highlights on the chains. Her eyes glow intensely. The overall scene is slightly dark but with bright, atmospheric light effects.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nMysterious, powerful, alluring, and slightly ominous. There's a sense of latent energy or magic, enhanced by the ethereal glow and the character's direct, compelling stare. The chains suggest a story of capture, control, or perhaps even self-mastery.\n\n**Combine for prompt:**\n\"Anime-style illustration of a fierce kitsune woman from a low-angle perspective, powerful and alluring.

    "refined_video_prompt": "Torso gently expands and contracts. Fox ears twitch. Hair sways softly. Collar bell subtly jingles. Chains slightly clink. Red eyes narrow and flicker. Shoulder fur shifts. Smoke/mist dissipates and reforms. Dust particles drift. Imperceptible camera zoom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Fierce snarl, crimson eyes blaze, snapping chains whip around a suddenly thrashing body. Fox tails erupt, fur bristling, thrusting toward the viewer. The bell violently clangs, smoke bursts from the ground, shattering surroundings. Hair whips with explosive force, defying gravity as the character lunges forward, dissolving into a furious storm of fiery dust, then reforming, poised for attack.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fox ears become ethereal smoke, eyes dissolving into swirling galaxies. Chains coil and uncoil, transmuting into iridescent, humming ribbons. The bell, now a shimmering orb, inverts light, pulling particles into its core as hair liquifies into glowing rivers, flowing upwards against gravity. The fur bursts into crystalline formations, slowly fracturing and reforming. Mist transforms into living shadows, consuming and recreating depth. The character warps, her form flickering between solid and pure energy.",
