  "video_prompt": "Glass \u201cblueberries\u201d subtly shift position on a white plate, glinting and reflecting ambient light. Shadows deepen under the moving marbles. A fork's tines slide into view, then out. Tiny light flares softly appear and vanish around the glass. ",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a high-angle, close-up shot of nine handcrafted blueberry-shaped glass marbles, meticulously arranged on a white plate. The marbles should gleam with light and dark blue hues, some with a subtle purple tint, and feature dark, intricate calyxes. Their surfaces should sparkle with tiny flecks. The arrangement is uneven, with two marbles then four then three. A polished fork's tines are visible to the right. Natural light casts distinct shadows and creates subtle lens flares. The white surface has subtle texture and reflections. Include a \"c29\" watermark in the bottom right corner.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Glass \"blueberries\" subtly reposition, causing glints to travel across their surfaces and reflections to shift. Shadows beneath the moving spheres deepen and lighten. Fork tines slide into the frame, then retreat. Tiny light flares softly emerge and vanish around the glass."
