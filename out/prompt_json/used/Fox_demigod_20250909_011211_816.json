    "image_prompt": "A stunning full-body digital painting of a sophisticated anthropomorphic fox character, reminiscent of traditional Chinese ink art and fantasy illustration. The fox, with vivid reddish-orange fur, striking yellow eyes, and a confident, almost mischievous expression, stands tall amidst an atmospheric traditional Chinese temple setting.\n\nThe fox is adorned with an array of intricate jewelry and clothing in a fusion of traditional Chinese and tribal aesthetics. A prominent golden bell necklace, multicolored beaded necklaces, and large, ornate turquoise and gold dangling earrings complement the vibrant color palette. Multi-colored ribbons cascade from the fox's left arm and waist, adding a dynamic sense of movement. A dark, flowing robe is cinched at the waist with a vibrant, layered sash of rich blues, reds, and greens. A tucked katana hilt suggests readiness and skill. The fox holds a delicate pale green hand fan with a subtle motif in its left hand, while its right hand loosely holds a small, earthy-toned pouch with a distinctive bulb of garlic attached, indicating a unique character element.\n\nThe composition is centered, with the fox as the primary focus, yet the background is richly detailed. Behind the fox, traditional Chinese temple architecture, with dark, intricate roofs and elegant lanterns, recedes into a hazy, mystical landscape of mountains and faint bodies of water. The overall lighting is dim and atmospheric, suggesting either an overcast day or a twilight setting, with soft, diffused light highlighting the character. The color palette is dominated by muted grays, blues, and greens in the background, contrasting with the warm, rich oranges, reds, and turquoise accents of the fox and its attire. The brushstrokes, though digital, evoke a painterly quality with subtle textures and depth. The bottom right features stylized Asian characters and \"C29\" in a golden hue. The top left corner includes the text \"AI 生成\".",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle fan sway, ribbons softly rustle, fur slightly shifts, bell pendant gently moves, distant water faintly ripples, camera subtly pushes in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive fan snap, ribbons whip violently, fur bristles in a gale, bell pendant slams, water erupts into a geyser. The temple roof tears apart, statues shatter outwards. The fox's eyes burn, glowing. A supernatural force twists the landscape, pillars crumble, the ground cracks open. Rapid camera zoom and crash.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Ethereal fox, fan swirling reality into fractured light, rainbow ribbons transmute into shimmering liquid, fur ripples with inverse gravity, bell pendant chimes celestial echoes, moon-water ripples *up* the cliffs, architectural elements dissolve into swirling starlight as the perspective folds into itself.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic zoom-in on the fox's piercing eyes, holding the fan aloft with a flourish. Ribbons flutter wildly as a sudden gust of wind sweeps through the ancient temple, silhouetting the fox against a flash of lightning. The bell pendant swings violently, its deep chime echoing as the fox's tail dramatically whips to one side. The camera then swiftly pulls back, revealing the vast, storm-swept landscape.",
