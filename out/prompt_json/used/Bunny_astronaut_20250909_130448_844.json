    "video_prompt": "Subtle upward and downward floating motion of the rabbit astronaut, gentle swaying of the astronaut's flexible hoses and suit elements, slow drift of the moon in the background, a very faint twinkle of distant stars in the upper right.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a cute, chubby, cartoonish baby character in a meticulously detailed white astronaut suit, floating in space with the moon as the background. The astronaut suit features a clear helmet visor, intricate controls, wires, and tubes. The character has large, expressive, innocent eyes with visible pupils and irises, and soft, round features with rosy cheeks and a slight smile. Long, white and pink rabbit ears protrude from the top of the helmet. The character's pose is dynamic, with arms slightly outstretched as if reaching or floating.\n\nThe background features the moon's surface, clearly visible with numerous craters and varied textures, illuminated by soft, natural-looking sunlight, creating shadows that define its topography. In the upper right corner, a sliver of Earth's atmosphere is visible, showing a subtle blue gradient merging into the blackness of space. The scene is lit with a gentle, diffuse light source coming from the upper right, casting subtle shadows on the astronaut suit and enhancing the moon's surface details. The overall atmosphere is whimsical, adventurous, and slightly ethereal, with a focus on high detail and realistic rendering of the space environment contrasted with the adorable, stylized character.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize (if selectable in the model):**\n\n*   **Character:** Cute baby, cartoonish, chubby, rabbit ears, large expressive eyes, rosy cheeks, friendly expression.\n*   **Suit:** Detailed white astronaut suit, clear helmet, visible tubes/wires, realistic textures.\n*   **Setting:** Space, lunar surface, Earth's atmosphere (small visible sliver).\n*   **Lighting:** Soft, direct sunlight from upper right, subtle shadows, realistic illumination.\n*   **Composition:** Full body shot, character floating centrally, moon as primary background.\n*   **Style:** Stylized realism, high detail, whimsical, adventurous.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nRabbit astronaut gently bobs up and down. Flexible hoses and suit elements subtly sway. Moon slowly glides across the background. Distant stars faintly twinkle in the upper right.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive upward thrust of the rabbit astronaut, hoses whipping wildly, limbs flailing violently; the moon in the background rapidly expands and contracts, craters rippling like liquid under unseen forces. Distant stars in the upper right surge and pulsate with blinding intensity, shooting out streaks of light. The astronaut's suit unexpectedly inflates then violently deflates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The rabbit astronaut's suit inflates and deflates with each breath, pulling the moon closer and then pushing it away. Its floppy ears become liquid, dripping stardust that reforms into miniature, glowing planets, which then spiral upwards into the astronaut's helmet, reflecting impossible nebulae. The astronaut’s umbilical cords detach and gracefully wrap around the entire scene, morphing into spectral spacecraft that drift backward, leaving trails of pure color.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The \"rabbit astronaut\" slowly begins to rotate, showcasing the detailed textures of its suit against the deep space. The moon subtly shifts in and out of frame, its craters brought into sharper relief with a gentle light change, while a single, brilliant star emerges in the distant upper right, catching and reflecting a faint, ethereal glow on the astronaut's visor.",
