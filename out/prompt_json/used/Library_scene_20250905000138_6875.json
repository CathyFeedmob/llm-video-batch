  "image_prompt": "Whimsical high-angle: cozy rustic study with tall wooden bookshelves. Foreground: aged wooden desk with an open, illegible book from which vibrant green dandelions with floating white seeds burst forth. To the left, a ginger cat; to the right, a tiny gerbil watching the seeds. Further right, a drawing of a blue butterfly emerging from black ink beside a fountain pen. A large window on the right shows a warm setting sun, illuminating the scene. Serene wonder, magical, combining nature, literature, and art.",
