    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA delightful and whimsical dessert shaped like a cheerful green alligator, lying on a pristine white ceramic plate. The alligator is made of light green sponge cake with a visible layer of white cream filling in its mouth, mimicking teeth. It has charming black eyes and subtle brown dots on its snout for nostrils. Along its back, there are rows of raised, lighter green cake segments simulating scales, and a few small, round green grapes are adorned with dollops of white cream on top. One whole grape is placed towards the tail of the alligator, and another cut grape half with its inner pulp visible is near the head, each resting on a small dollop of white cream. The lighting is soft and bright, creating gentle shadows on the plate, suggesting natural light from the upper left. The overall aesthetic is clean, inviting, and slightly playful. The background is simple and out of focus, a neutral dark gray, allowing the subject to stand out. A small, subtle white text \"c29\" is in the bottom right corner of the plate.\n\n**Visual elements:** Green alligator-shaped cake, white cream filling, black eye details, brown snout dots, green grapes (whole and halved), white cream dollops, white ceramic plate.\n**Style:** Whimsical, realistic, playful, culinary photography.\n**Composition:** Close-up, eye-level shot, subject positioned diagonally from top-right to bottom-left, creating dynamic flow. Ample negative space around the subject on the plate.\n**Colors:** Dominant light green, white, black, brown, dark gray (background).\n**Lighting:** Soft, bright, directional (from upper left), creating subtle shadows for depth.\n**Atmosphere:** Clean, fresh, inviting, delightful, charming.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle light reflections shimmer across the cake's surface. Grapes subtly twitch and rotate. A very slow, slight zoom-in occurs.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "EXPLOSIVE GREEN CAKE: The crocodile cake violently thrashes, its body elongating and snapping, while the grapes ricochet off its scales like miniature projectiles. The white plate shatters into a thousand shards, reforming instantly around the frenzied beast. The entire scene pulsates with a blinding green flash as it hurtles towards the viewer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The green cake shimmers with an internal, pulsating light, and its scales slowly unfurl, revealing iridescent, feathery textures. The grapes, instead of twitching, detach and orbit the cake, briefly merging into a singular, glowing orb before returning to their positions, now subtly inverted. The cake then begins to slowly invert too, as if defying gravity, rotating on its plate just a fraction before righting itself. The plate itself softly undulates, its edges briefly blurring into a soft luminescence. A dreamlike, slow zoom in captures these impossible transformations.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, initially wide, slowly glides forward, revealing the pristine white plate and its vibrant green alligator cake. A soft, warm light begins to emanate from the cake, causing the green surface to subtly glisten, as if alive. The plump green grapes adorning its back\nimperceptibly shift, as if gently breathing. A dramatic, slow zoom-in commences, tightening on the alligator's face, its dark eyes seeming to follow the camera. The background subtly blurs, emphasizing the cake's enchanting presence. The soft light pulses.",
