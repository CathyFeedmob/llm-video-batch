    "video_prompt": "The girl's hair subtly sways as if a gentle breeze passes by. Her eyes blink slowly, then narrow just a fraction, as if observing something intently. A faint pulse beats at her neck. A soft, dynamic light shimmer across her clothing, highlighting the curves and folds.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Style & Medium:** Ink wash painting, traditional Chinese ink rendering, sumi-e, loose brushstrokes, expressive, textured paper, subtle splashes and drips. Black and white (grisaille) with varying shades of grey, emphasizing contrast and depth.\n\n**Subject:** A young woman, anime-inspired design, mid-shot composition. She has long, dark hair, styled partially swept back with ribbons/bows, and bangs framing her face. She wears what appears to be a modern interpretation of a qipao or cheongsam, featuring a high collar, distinct button-and-loop closures (frog fasteners) on the chest, and potentially long sleeves. Her expression is serene and contemplative, with large, soulful eyes looking slightly down and to the left. Delicate earrings are visible.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:** Waist-up portrait, slightly off-center, with the woman facing slightly to the left but her gaze directed downwards. The background is sparse and minimalistic, providing a clean, almost abstract setting that highlights the subject. Dynamic poses suggested by the loose brushwork on her arms, which are positioned as if folded or resting.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:** Soft, diffused light, suggesting an overcast day or studio setting, with shadows and highlights created by the varying ink density. The overall atmosphere is elegant, introspective, and a bit melancholic, yet refined. The rough texture of the ink adds to a sense of organic beauty.\n\n**Details:** Noticeable individual brush hairs and streaks contribute to the painting's hand-drawn quality. The eyes have subtle, visible pupils and catch-lights. The \"C29\" signature/mark is in the bottom right corner, rendered in the same ink wash style.\n\n**Emphasis:** Focus on the flowing lines of the hair and clothing, the delicate features of the face, and the expressive nature of the ink medium. The contrast between dark ink and lighter areas should be pronounced.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The girl's hair undulates with a gentle breeze. Her eyes slowly blink, then subtly narrow. A faint pulse visibly beats at her neck. Dynamic light shimmers across her clothing, highlighting shifting contours.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The girl's hair whips violently, each strand lashing like a serpent. Her eyes snap open, pupils dilating into void-like pools, then instantly converging to piercing pinpricks. Veins throb explosively on her neck. Her clothing ripples and flexes with an internal, turbulent energy, fabric tearing as hidden powers erupt, revealing pulsing light and shifting forms beneath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The girl's inky hair, now constellations, swirls into a vortex, swallowing the light. Her eyes, two miniature galaxies, blink backwards, stars winking into existence. A spectral pulse at her neck reverses time, wrinkles smoothing. Her cheongsam, a liquid nebula, shimmers with impossible colors, contorting into abstract geometries, defying fabric, becoming pure energy. Gravity falters, sending only her thoughts upward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly tracks forward, revealing the girl's subtle hair sway. A rapid, dramatic zoom-in highlights her slow, narrowing gaze and the subtle pulse at her neck, then the camera pulls back, arcing around her as the shimmering light across her clothing intensifies, casting dynamic shadows. Her pose becomes more assertive, hinting at a hidden resolve as the light pulses with her.",
