    "video_prompt": "Subtle light flickering across the city skyline, gentle wisps of mist drifting in the sky, and very slow, almost imperceptible scaling of the central sun as if it's setting. The glowing lines in the sky subtly shimmer and shift.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nAbstract cyberpunk city skyline silhouetted against a dramatic sky. On the left, tall, sharp, inky black skyscraper structures rise vertically, reaching towards a large, glowing, hazy full moon positioned centrally in the upper left quadrant. The buildings are minimalist, almost like sharp lines, with some suggestion of detailed, futuristic architecture at their bases. The sky transitions from a deep, atmospheric teal and dark blue at the top and bottom to a vibrant, warm orange and yellow in the middle, creating a striking gradient. Wispy, ethereal clouds or energetic light trails in shades of glowing orange and yellow streak across the sky, following a dynamic, diagonal flow, especially pronounced across the mid-ground and lower right. Similar light streaks are woven through the silhouetted cityscape, suggesting movement or reflected light, particularly around the lower left and middle. The overall composition is diagonal, with the urban sprawl extending from the lower left towards the mid-right horizon, featuring smaller, spiky, dark silhouettes of buildings. The aesthetic is highly stylized and painterly, with a blend of liquid-like textures and sharp, defined lines, evoking a futuristic, slightly ominous atmosphere. Cinematic lighting emphasizes the glow of the moon and the fiery sky.\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Abstract cyberpunk city skyline, full moon.\n*   **Style:** Abstract, painterly, futuristic, cinematic, high contrast.\n*   **Composition:** Prominent vertical lines (skyscrapers), large celestial body (moon), strong diagonal flow (light trails, city extension). Silhouetted foreground/midground.\n*   **Colors:** Deep teal/dark blue, vivid orange/yellow, bright white/pale yellow (moon), pure black (silhouettes).\n*   **Lighting:** Backlighting from the moon and glowing sky. Emissive light trails. High contrast between dark silhouettes and bright sky.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Dramatic, ethereal, dynamic, futuristic, slightly ominous.\n*   **Details:** Hazy moon, wispy/energetic light streaks, sharp and spiky building silhouettes, textural elements in the sky and foreground.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Prompt:**\n\nCity lights subtly flicker. Mist gently drifts. The sun imperceptibly scales and descends. Sky-lines softly shimmer and shift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "City skyline violently convulses, towering spires thrashing like whips, unleashing sharp shards against the sky. The central sun expands explosively, radiating intense, white-hot bursts that scorch the clouds. Glowing lines in the sky ignite into jagged lightning strikes, tearing through the air. Mist transforms into raging torrents, smashing against buildings. Pure, destructive energy rips through the scene with jarring, rapid movements.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The city's spires gently spiral inward, unraveling into streams of starlight. The central sun expands, then implodes, creating a black hole from which luminous liquid pours, defying gravity as it rains upwards, coalescing into impossible geometric forms. Glowing lines in the sky warp and intertwine, forming ephemeral constellations that shimmer with silent music, as the entire horizon bends and folds onto itself, revealing glimpses of other dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pulls back, revealing the entire futuristic cityscape blanketed in mist. Golden light explodes from the setting sun, casting dynamic shadows that crawl up skyscraper-like structures. Wisps of mist intertwine with shimmering light trails, forming a celestial dance. The camera glides down, revealing the city's hidden depths as a lone figure emerges into the subtle light, gazing up at the colossal, diminishing sun.",
