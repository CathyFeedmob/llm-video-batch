  "video_prompt": "A woman's face subtly turns, her bright blue eye shifting gaze. Futuristic AR glasses display dynamic holographic elements: a circular target pulsates, binary code streams, graphs fluctuate, and charts rotate. Digital text appears and disappears below her mouth, while a larger octagon-shaped display glows beside her chin. Soft background glows shift, revealing abstract shapes and sparkling light particles.",
  "image_prompt": "Close-up eye-level shot of a woman's futuristic face, angled slightly right, eye gazing upper-right. She wears clear AR glasses displaying complex holographic digital overlays: target, binary \"0110100101\", fluctuating line graphs, bar graphs, circular charts. Text \"ananlyzing data input errors\" and another circular chart appear below her mouth. A large \"C29\" octagon is visible by her chin. The background is a softly blurred, dark, glowing digital environment with abstract shapes and sparkling light particles. Dramatic lighting emphasizes facial contours and glowing digital elements.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A woman's face subtly pivots, her bright blue eye actively shifting gaze. Her AR glasses animate with dynamic holograms: a pulsating target, streaming binary, fluctuating graphs, and rotating charts. Digital text rapidly appears and vanishes below her mouth. A large octagon display beside her chin intensely pulses. The background glows fluidly shift and swirl, abstract shapes materializing and dissipating amidst continuously sparkling light particles."
