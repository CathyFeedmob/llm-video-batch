    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull-body shot of a powerful, futuristic gorilla-mech robot standing on a glowing sci-fi platform within a subtly blurred, futuristic urban environment at twilight. The robot is predominantly black and titanium silver, with prominent, bright neon blue glowing accents on its chest, forearms, shoulder pads, eyes, and lower legs, simulating internal energy. Its head is designed like a gorilla, with detailed metallic fur texture on its brow and glowing blue eyes that convey determination. Two glowing blue cylindrical energy tanks are mounted on its back, connected by a glowing blue tube. The robot exhibits a bulky, muscular build, with visible hydraulic components and intricate paneling across its armor. The composition is a low-angle, slightly upward shot, emphasizing its imposing size. The lighting is strong and contrasting, with highlights catching the metallic surfaces and emphasizing the blue glow. The atmosphere is sleek, high-tech, and futuristic. Subtle bokeh lights from the city can be seen in the distant background. The resolution is crisp and highly detailed, with a focus on metallic textures and glowing elements.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Powerful, futuristic gorilla-mech robot.\n*   **Pose/Action:** Standing still, full-body shot, asserting dominance.\n*   **Materials/Colors:** Predominantly black and titanium silver armor with bright neon blue glowing accents.\n*   **Key Features:** Gorilla-like head design with metallic fur textures and glowing blue eyes. Two glowing blue cylindrical energy tanks on the back connected by a tube. Prominent glowing blue lines on chest, forearms, shoulder pads, and lower legs. Bulky, muscular build with visible hydraulic components and intricate paneling.\n*   **Environment:** Glowing sci-fi platform. Subtly blurred futuristic urban environment at twilight/night.\n*   **Composition:** Full-body, low-angle, slightly upward shot.\n*   **Lighting:** Strong, contrasting, highlighting metallic surfaces and emphasizing blue glow.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Sleek, high-tech, futuristic.\n*   **Details:** Crisp resolution, highly detailed metallic textures, emphasis on glowing elements, subtle bokeh in background.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle rhythmic blue light glow on the suit. Gentle chest expansion and contraction, mimicking breath. Slow, subtle camera parallax shift from left to right.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Unleashing Primal Fury: A Cybernetic Gorilla's Explosive Roar!**\n\nThe cybernetic gorilla's chest violently expands, blue lights flash erratically, and its metallic limbs snap into a furious rampage. It smashes the ground, sending shockwaves of energy, sparks erupt from its joints as it lunges forward, claws extended. The camera aggressively pulls back, revealing scorching ground and debris flying from its destructive path.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The armored gorilla suit shimmers, its blue lights igniting and extinguishing randomly, then detaching and swirling like fireflies. The suit's chest expands and contracts, not with breath, but with ripples of liquid light that flow through its metallic form. The entire scene inverts and spins slowly, gravity pulling the gorilla upwards into the sky as celestial bodies appear and disappear around it. The camera warps and stretches, revealing impossible angles and dimensions. The suit's components deconstruct and reform into shimmering, non-Euclidean geometries, endlessly transforming.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The hulking metallic Gorilla-Mech stands under the city lights; a slow cinematic arc shot circles the Mech revealing subtle rhythmic blue light pulses. Suddenly, the camera dramatically zooms into its chest as it subtly expands and contracts, simulating a mechanical breath. The camera drifts in a smooth parallax shift from left to right across the Mech's illuminated eyes, intensifying its imposing gaze.",
