  "video_prompt": "A robotic bee-wasp takes flight from a low angle. Its metallic green and gold body shimmers. Transparent, iridescent wings with sparkling veins rapidly beat. Delicate mouthparts open and close. Front legs subtly articulate, and segmented legs beneath the body flex as it moves. The C29 logo in the corner might subtly pulse.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:**\n\nA stunning low-angle medium shot of a robotic bee-wasp against a stark black background. The creature features a metallic emerald green head and thorax, transitioning to a vibrant gold and emerald green segmented abdomen. It has large, glossy black compound eyes, thin articulated antennae, and delicate mouthparts. Two sets of transparent, iridescent wings with complex vein-like structures and sparkling dots emerge from the thorax. The robotic legs are a blend of slender gold and dark grey components. The C29 logo, bold and 3D with white faces and a gold outline, is in the bottom right corner. Soft, focused lighting highlights the metallic sheen and wing iridescence. Shallow depth of field, black background.",
