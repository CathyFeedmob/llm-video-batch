    "video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom out, slight haze and glow around the laser beams, distant shimmering of stars, Earth's clouds subtly shift, small moon rover slowly traverses the lunar surface.",
    "image_prompt": "A hyperrealistic vertical shot of a futuristic power station on the moon, with Earth visible in the background. The moon's surface is dark gray, cratered, and rocky, with distinct shadows from the structures and mountains.\n\nDominating the foreground and extending into the midground are rows of tall, dark gray, cylindrical towers with intricate mechanical details, glowing orange and blue lights, and large, flat, circular bases. Each tower emits a vibrant, glowing blue beam of light vertically upwards, with a glowing blue ring around the top. These beams converge towards the Earth in the background, creating a sense of energy transfer.\n\nThe Earth is prominently featured in the upper-midground, a large, detailed sphere with visible continents and oceans, illuminated as if by sunlight from the right. The sky is a deep, dark space, filled with countless tiny white stars. In the upper left, a small, crescent moon is visible, and in the upper right, a bright, white sun-like star with lens flare effects is present, casting bright rays and illuminating the scene from the upper right.\n\nThe overall lighting is dramatic, with strong contrasts between the illuminated areas and the deep shadows. The atmosphere is sci-fi and monumental. A small, white, box-like rover is visible on the lunar surface in the bottom right, and a subtle \"C29\" logo is in the very bottom right corner. The composition creates a strong sense of depth, leading the eye from the foreground structures to the distant Earth.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera dolly out, laser beams glow and haze, stars subtly twinkle, Earth's clouds gently swirl, moon rover slowly crawls.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**INTENSE ZOOM OUT reveals furious beams ERUPTING from the moon's surface, RIPPING through the atmosphere! The Earth violently SPINS, clouds WHIRLING into a CATACLYSMIC storm. Stars EXPLODE into dazzling nova. The moon rover JUMPS, then HURTLES  across the lunar landscape, leaving a trail of DUST and CRATERS in its wake.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Lasers bloom into vibrant nebulae, pulling Earth closer until landmasses meld into swirling paint. Moons orbit erratically, shrinking, then expanding into shimmering portals. The rover glides backward, leaving trails of light that condense into miniature stars. Lunar mountains ripple like liquid, dissolving into cosmic dust, re-forming as crystalline spires, while time itself loops and folds.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide, slow, cinematic pan reveals a lunar landscape bristling with colossal, glowing energy conduits, their blue laser beams piercing the hazy atmosphere towards a subtly shifting Earth. As the camera subtly zooms out, the moon rover, previously unseen in the vast emptiness, rolls into frame, its tiny form emphasizing the immense scale of the alien technology. Stars shimmer, and distant planets are hinted at, adding to the cosmic awe.",
