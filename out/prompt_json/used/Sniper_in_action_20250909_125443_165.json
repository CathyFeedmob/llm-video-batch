    "video_prompt": "A young woman in dark, tactical gear, holding a sniper rifle, kneels on a weathered wooden bridge under moonlight.\n\n**Movements:**\n*   Her chest subtly rises and falls with breathing.\n*   Loose strands of her long black hair gently sway.\n*   The material of her long dark coat slightly ripples, as if caught by a faint breeze.\n*   The reflective surface of her arm and leg armor shows a soft, almost imperceptible shimmer from ambient light.\n*   Her gloved fingers shift ever so slightly around the rifle's grip.\n*   The green light from the rifle scope emits a very subtle, almost pulsing glow.\n*   Distant city lights in the background appear to flicker gently.\n*   A slow, almost imperceptible zoom in on the woman, maintaining focus.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a female character, long straight black hair with bangs, wearing a sleek black, form-fitting tactical suit with futuristic armored elements on the knees, forearms, and shoulders, and a long flowing black trench coat. She is in a low, crouching sniper pose, aiming a long-barreled sniper rifle with a scope, right eye gazing intently through the scope, left eye visible. There is a distinctive grey eye patch covering her left eye. The rifle has a wooden grip and a black barrel with a suppressor.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:** Dynamic low-angle shot, looking slightly up at the character, emphasizing the length of the rifle barrel pointing out of the frame towards the viewer. The character is positioned slightly off-center to the left, occupying the midground.\n\n**Setting:** Outdoors, on a disused, weathered wooden railway or pedestrian bridge at night. The bridge features large, dark metallic girders and support structures.\n\n**Lighting:** Cool, urban night lighting with subtle blue and grey tones. Soft, diffused light highlights the character and the immediate foreground, creating depth. Distant city lights or car lights are blurred in the background, appearing as small, bright orange and blue bokeh dots. The top of the rifle scope has a faint green glow.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Gritty, serious, and tactical. A sense of quiet readiness and intent.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, highly detailed, slightly hyper-realistic with sharp focus on the character and rifle. Cinematic.\n\n**Additional details (if specific keywords are needed for AI):** military cosplay, futuristic armor, tactical gear, urban decay, night scene, sniper, warrior.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle rise and fall of chest with breathing. Loose hair strands and coat ripple gently from a faint breeze. Soft, almost imperceptible shimmer on reflective armor. Gloved fingers shift slightly on rifle grip. Rifle scope emits a subtle, pulsing green light. Distant city lights gently flicker. Slow, imperceptible zoom in, maintaining focus.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sniper scope flares intensely, crosshairs snapping onto target. Her coat rips violently upward, transforming into flapping wings. The wooden bridge splinters explosively, planks rocketing skyward as the entire structure twists and collapses. Distant city lights erupt into chaotic, surging streams, while the moon itself pulses with an angry, accelerating beat.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A young woman in dark, tactical gear, holding a sniper rifle, kneels on a weathered wooden bridge under moonlight.\n\n**Movements:**\n*   Her chest collapses inward, impossibly shrinking her form.\n*   Her long black hair streams upwards, dissolving into starlight.\n*   Her coat morphs into liquid shadow, flowing impossibly into the wooden bridge beneath.\n*   Her arm and leg armor ripple like water, revealing glimpses of glowing cosmic dust within.\n*   The rifle's grip in her gloved fingers stretches and twists into an infinite spiral.\n*   The green light from the scope pulses erratically, projecting impossible geometric patterns into the surroundings.\n*   Distant city lights in the background bloom into vibrant, non-Euclidean structures, then vanish.\n*   The entire scene slowly inverts its own colors, creating a negative photographic effect.\n*   The bridge planks slowly twist and writhe, transforming into sentient tendrils that reach for the sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A young woman, cloaked in dark, tactical gear, kneels on a weathered bridge, a sniper rifle poised. **The camera slowly glides past her, revealing the moonlit city below her.** As she breathes, **her chest visibly expands, then slowly contracts**. Her long black hair, **a playful tendril, dances across her cheek**. The rifle scope's **green light pulsates, casting an eerie glow on her face**. In the distance, **city lights twitch, each flicker a fleeting thought**. The camera **lingers, a silent observer in this nocturnal tableau.**",
