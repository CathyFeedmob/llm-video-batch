  "image_prompt": "A striking, vertically oriented still-life of a handcrafted, textile landscape. A light blue and white wavy \"river\" flows through soft, fluffy beige and light brown \"landmasses.\" A detailed white, black, and red Red-crowned Crane perches on a landmass. White felt flowers with yellow centers and green leaves are scattered throughout, along with fluffy light blue and white pom-poms. The scene has a soft, whimsical, plush toy-like quality with a serene, natural color palette. Soft, even lighting highlights the textures.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "River water subtly weaves and undulates, a crane's feathered wings gently unfurl and fold. Flowers unfurl their delicate petals. Fluffy cloud forms softly dissipate and reform, as the landscape's woven elements gently shift and ripple."
