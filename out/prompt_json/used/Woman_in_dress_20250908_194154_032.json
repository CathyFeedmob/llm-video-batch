    "video_prompt": "A subtle ripple propagates through the surface of the stream, making the reflection of the surrounding foliage shimmer slightly. Her hair strands gently sway with a soft breath, and her eyes blink naturally. The individual leaves on the floral headpiece and on the surrounding trees subtly rustle. The light on her glossy outfit gently shifts, creating a slight play of reflections.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body portrait of a beautiful young woman, standing in a lush, misty river canyon. She has long, dark brown hair styled with a central part, adorned with a floral crown featuring vibrant pink roses and dark purple berries. Her expressive eyes are light grey-green, with subtle eyeliner and natural brows. Her lips are a soft, natural rose color.\n\nShe wears a striking, form-fitting, high-collar dress made of glossy, iridescent black latex or a similar wet-look material. The dress is intricately embellished with raised, vine-like patterns and organic, blob-like textures that appear to drip and flow over the fabric, especially on the shoulders, bodice, sleeves, and hem. The design gives the impression of a liquid, almost sentient garment, with a subtle shimmer. The bust is molded and defined within the dress. She wears matching full-length, fingerless or glove-like sleeves that extend past her elbows, also covered in the organic, flowing textures.\n\nHer right arm is slightly bent, and her left hand is gently resting near her thigh. The setting is a deep, verdant canyon with sheer rock faces covered in moss and foliage. A clear river or stream flows gently at her feet, with rocks and green moss visible. The lighting is soft and diffused, characteristic of an overcast or misty day, creating a natural, slightly ethereal glow on her skin and the reflective surface of her dress. The atmosphere is mysterious and enchanting.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize for generation:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Young beautiful woman, ethereal, captivating gaze.\n*   **Hair:** Long, parted, dark brown, slightly wet look.\n*   **Headwear:** Pink roses (vibrant, realistic), dark berries, vine-like placement.\n*   **Attire:** Glossy black latex/wet-look dress, high collar, form-fitting.\n*   **Dress Details:** Intricate raised vine-like patterns, organic blob/drip textures, reflective surface, molded bust. Matching long sleeves.\n*   **Setting:** River canyon, lush greenery, misty/atmospheric, flowing water, mossy rocks.\n*   **Lighting:** Soft, diffused, natural, slightly ethereal.\n*   **Composition:** Full body portrait, centered subject.\n*   **Style:** Fantasy, dark fantasy, elegant, hyperrealistic, detailed.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle ripples expand on the water, distorting reflections. Her hair sways softly as she blinks. Leaves on her headpiece and nearby trees gently rustle. Light shifts across her outfit, altering reflections.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her glossy outfit violently ripples and melts, tendrils erupting to writhe and contort. The water below boils, impossibly surging upward, reflecting a chaotic and distorted forest. Leaves on the headpiece and trees thrash wildly, detaching and spinning into a vortex around her, while her hair snaps and whips like furious snakes. Her eyes gleam with an internal, flickering light, blinking with unnatural speed and intensity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her headpiece blossoms into iridescent jellyfish, trailing neon tendrils as her hair transforms into a flowing river upstream. The stream's reflection shows the river moving backwards, defying its own current. Her outfit, a swirling nebula of liquid light, morphs into a cascade of bioluminescent butterflies that flutter and dissolve into pure sound waves. The canyon walls undulate like breathing organs, and the very air shimmers with impossible geometry.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dark, cinematic close-up on her face, the foliage-adorned headpiece framing her intense gaze. The camera slowly zooms out as her eyes blink, revealing the glossy, almost fluid, black dress that contours her body. Then, a dramatic, sweeping shot from below, following the ripples in the stream as they expand, distorting the reflections of the deep green trees. The camera follows upward, revealing the dark, winding path of the stream through the mysterious forest, hinting at an unseen presence.",
