    "video_prompt": "A gleaming, chrome figure sprints forward, casting reflections of the city around it. A luminous, spiraling vortex of red and blue light trails around the figure, emanating faint, sparkling particles that glitter and dance in the air. Blurred human silhouettes move in the background. Subtle streaks of light from distant cars and lamps move across the ground. The image is set against a blurry urban background of skyscrapers. A metallic logo \"c29\" subtly shimmers on the bottom right. The camera subtly tracks the running figure.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A futuristic, sleek, chrome-plated android (humanoid robot) with glowing red eyes, running dynamically forward from a low angle. The robot should be highly reflective, showing subtle reflections of its urban surroundings.\n\n**Setting:** A bustling, vibrant city street in a major metropolis (e.g., Times Square, Tokyo Shibuya crossing feel) at twilight or night. Tall, modern skyscrapers frame the background, with some showcasing illuminated windows. The street is crowded with blurred, silhouetted human figures walking in various directions, indicating movement and a busy environment.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Perspective:** Low-angle shot, looking up slightly at the robot as it strides forward, creating a sense of power and motion.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The robot is positioned slightly off-center, dominating the mid-ground.\n*   **Depth:** Clear foreground (street), mid-ground (robot and blurred people), and background (buildings).\n*   **Dynamic Lines:** The motion blur of the people and the light trails create diagonal and horizontal lines, enhancing dynamism.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Key Light:** The robot emits a strong, internal red glow from its eyes, casting a subtle red sheen on its metallic body.\n*   **Ambient Light:** The city is aglow with warm and cool artificial lights from billboards, streetlights, and building windows, creating a vibrant, energetic urban atmosphere.\n*   **Special Effects (Light Trails/Particles):**\n    *   A large, concentric, spiraling vortex of bright, highly energetic light particles (predominantly red/orange and blue/cyan) emanates from behind and around the robot, suggesting speed, power, or a portal effect. These particles should be sharp and distinct, with some appearing as streaks due to motion.\n    *   Smaller, scattered red and blue light specks/orbs are present across the ground and in the air, creating a shimmering, dynamic effect, as if the robot is disturbing energy as it moves.\n    *   Reflections of these colored lights are visible on the wet or reflective street surface, appearing as elongated blurs.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Cool blues, grays, and black for the city structures and shadows.\n*   **Accents:** Vibrant, saturated reds, oranges, and electric blues from the glowing lights and energy trails.\n*   **Contrast:** High contrast between the bright, glowing elements and the darker, shadowed urban environment.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Photorealistic with sci-fi elements.**\n*   **Cinematic, high-energy, immersive.**\n*   **Sharp focus on the robot, with realistic depth of field blurring the background and foreground people.**\n*   **Vibrant and luminous.**\n\n**Overall Impression:** A powerful, futuristic entity in motion amidst a bustling, neon-lit cityscape, surrounded by an aura of dynamic energy.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The chrome figure glides, cityscape reflections rippling across its form. The swirling red and blue light vortex around it expands and contracts, its glittering particles drifting and dissipating. Human silhouettes in the background subtly shift their positions. Distant car and lamp light streaks streak across the ground. The camera smoothly tracks the figure's momentum.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Chrome figure surges, tearing through reality. City lights explode into a swirling vortex, dragging skyscrapers into its fierce kinetic dance. Red and blue energy coils, shattering into explosive sparks that pierce the ground. Blurred crowds whip past, their forms stretching, distorting. Ground blurs, asphalt melting into streaks as the figure punches through the fabric of space itself. \"c29\" ignites, pulsed with raw power.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A gleaming, chrome figure sprints forward as people reverse-walk into buildings. The luminous vortex morphs into a swirling black hole, sucking in cityscape elements which emerge as shimmering liquid on the ground. Faint particles explode into blossoming flowers, then phase through the chrome figure as it defies gravity, floating backward. Streaks of light from impossible sources weave through the impossible landscape. The c29 logo ripples.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A gleaming, chrome figure sprints forward, the camera following in a dynamic tracking shot. As it moves, a luminous, spiraling vortex of red and blue light trails around it, the sparkling particles intensifying and swirling to a dramatic crescendo. The camera then swiftly pulls back, revealing blurred human silhouettes caught in the dazzling light, their heads turning in slow-motion wonder. A sudden, sharp zoom-in on the figure's glowing red eyes, moments before it dramatically lunges forward, blurring the urban background and the \"c29\" logo.",
