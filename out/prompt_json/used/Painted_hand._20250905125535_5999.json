  "video_prompt": "A hand, with wet, glossy skin, gently unfurls its fingers. Vibrant flowers subtly bloom and sway around it. Translucent fabric clinging to an arm shimmers and shifts. The background's blues and greens fluidly meld, while small, circular specks twinkle and drift.",
  "image_prompt": "Digital painting of a woman's hand, glossy and wet, surrounded by vibrant cosmos-like flowers (orange, red, white, lavender) on a delicate vine. The hand is peach-toned with pink nails. Part of the arm is covered in sheer, wet, iridescent fabric. The background is a flowing, painterly blend of blue and green, with scattered white circular specks resembling raindrops or bokeh. The style mimics oil/acrylic with visible brushstrokes, evoking a dreamy, ethereal, and surreal atmosphere.",
