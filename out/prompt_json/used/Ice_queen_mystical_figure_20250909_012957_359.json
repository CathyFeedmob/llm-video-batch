    "video_prompt": "Faint glow of blue and gold particles subtly drift upwards and shimmer across her crystalline form. The sheer fabric veil behind her gently sways as if caught in a soft, unseen breeze. Slight rise and fall of her chest, indicating subtle breathing. Her eyelids gently flutter open, revealing eyes that slowly blink, then gaze upward.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA full-body shot of a majestic, ethereal female figure, designed as a \"Winter Spirit\" or \"Ice Queen.\" She stands tall, with her head slightly tilted back and eyes gently closed, as if in contemplation or embracing an unseen light. Her skin is pale and luminous, with delicate hints of glitter or frost. She wears an intricate, fantastical gown or armor of shimmering silver and ice-like textures, adorned with countless tiny, sparkling particles resembling crystals, diamonds, or glistening frost.\n\nThe attire features delicate, ice-encrusted feather-like details around her neck and shoulders, and subtle, elegant white feathered wings are visible emerging from her back, catching the light. Throughout her body and clothing, small, glowing specks of light are scattered, predominantly in shades of electric blue and warm gold/amber, creating a magical, twinkling effect. Her hands are elegantly posed, with a graceful, almost flowing appearance of her crystalline sleeves.\n\nThe background is dark and soft, with large swathes of sheer, translucent white or very light blue fabric draped vertically, creating a flowing, airy, and slightly mysterious atmosphere. Scattered bokeh lights, similar in color to the sparkles on her body (blue and gold), are visible in the background, adding depth and a dreamlike quality.\n\n**Visual elements:** Female figure, ethereal, Winter Spirit, Ice Queen, luminous skin, pale, glittering frost, intricate gown/armor, shimmering silver, ice textures, crystals, diamonds, glistening frost, delicate feather details, white feathered wings.\n**Style:** Fantastical, high-fantasy, elegant, ethereal, magical, artistic, hyperrealistic with a stylized fantastical twist.\n**Composition:** Full-body shot, vertical orientation, central focus on the figure, slightly low-angle perspective emphasizing her height and grandeur.\n**Colors:** Predominantly cold and cool tones (silver, white, ice blue), contrasted with subtle warm accents (gold/amber sparkles). Dark background that enhances the luminosity of the figure and lights.\n**Lighting:** Soft, dramatic, and directional lighting that highlights the crystalline textures and creates a glowing effect. Heavy use of shimmering light and glowing particles.\n**Atmosphere:** Majestic, serene, magical, mystical, dreamlike, cold but captivating.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle upward drift and shimmer of blue and gold particles across her form. The sheer veil behind her gently sways. Her chest subtly rises and falls. Eyelids flutter open, eyes slowly blink, then gaze upward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Violent gusts whip the sheer veil behind her into a tempestuous frenzy, tearing shreds of fabric. Jagged ice shards erupt from her crystalline form, piercing the air. Her eyes snap open, glowing with blinding blue light as lightning crackles across her skin. With a roar, she unleashes potent energy tendrils that rip through the illusion, causing the very ground to fracture and heave beneath her.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her crystalline form shatters into floating shards, each piece momentarily holding a fragment of the blue and gold light before reforming into shimmering, ethereal wings that unfurl upwards, pulling the androgynous figure into the swirling veil. The veil then solidifies into a towering ice sculpture, momentarily trapping her before melting into a torrent of liquid light that dissolves into the air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A soft backlight illuminates the diaphanous veil as it gently billows. The camera slowly tracks right, revealing a figure of ice and light. A subtle shimmer begins, intensifying into sparkling gold and cyan motes that dance across her crystalline form, momentarily illuminating her closed eyes. The camera gradually zooms in, settling on her face as her eyelids slowly part, revealing eyes that appear to glow internally.",
