  "video_prompt": "Dense mist swirls through a long, narrow industrial passage. A brilliant, hazy light at the distant end subtly pulses and intensifies, casting shifting greenish-white and warm yellow-orange glints on wet, reflective ground. Smaller glowing orbs flicker in the mid-ground. The heavy fog thickens and thins, obscuring and revealing details, as a hidden doorway on the left wall slowly creaks open, letting more light spill out. A small industrial cart in the mid-ground begins to slowly roll forward into the haze.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Concise & Detailed):**\n\"A long, narrow, industrial alleyway, central perspective, leading to a brilliant, hazy light source at the distant vanishing point. Shrouded in dense, cool mist. Desaturated cool palette of dark teal, murky green, and deep blue-grey, contrasted by bright greenish-white and occasional warm yellow-orange highlights. Dark, wet, reflective ground with puddles. Flanked by aged, grimy industrial walls with exposed pipes and low, dark platforms. A dark, indistinct cart in the mid-ground. A powerful, diffuse glow emanates from the far end, with smaller glowing orbs piercing the heavy mist, creating immense depth. Atmospheric, desolate, urban decay, and suspenseful mystery.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\"Long, narrow, misty industrial alley, central perspective towards a brilliant, hazy light source at the vanishing point. Desaturated cool tones of dark teal, murky green, blue-grey, with bright greenish-white and warm yellow highlights. Wet, reflective ground. Aged, grimy walls with exposed pipes and low platforms. Dark cart in mid-ground. Powerful, diffuse distant glow and piercing orb lights through heavy fog, creating a desolate, mysterious atmosphere of urban decay.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Ultra Concise - for models that infer a lot):**\n\"Misty industrial alley, long and narrow, central perspective to a blinding distant light. Cool desaturated palette (teal, green, blue-grey) with bright highlights. Wet reflective ground, aged walls, exposed pipes, dark platforms, mid-ground cart. Heavy fog with glowing orbs. Desolate, mysterious, urban decay.\"",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Dense mist swirls and billows. A brilliant, hazy light pulses and intensifies from the receding space, casting shifting glints. Glowing orbs flicker into and out of view. The swirling fog thickens and thins, as a concealed opening slowly creaks wider, letting light spill out and expand. An industrial cart rolls slowly forward into the billowing obscurity."
