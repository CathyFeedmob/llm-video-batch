  "video_prompt": "A small hovercraft glides slowly across a desolate, snow-covered alien terrain, its blue propulsion energy pulsing. As it approaches a colossal, ancient-looking cybernetic entity, the giant awakens. Its glowing golden and blue internal mechanisms subtly activate, pistons shifting, and its serene expression slowly evolves. Mist swirls around its base, while the vibrant cosmic nebula in the sky above pulsates and shifts, intensifying the star twinkle. The scene transforms from still mystery to active discovery.",
  "image_prompt": "A colossal, ancient humanoid cybernetic deity or statue, made of weathered light grey metal/stone with a stoic sculptural face, intricate glowing gold and blue mechanical conduits, and ship-like head structures, stands on a desolate, snow-covered alien planet with subtle buried ruins. A small industrial hovercraft with orange and blue glowing elements explores the icy foreground, dramatically emphasizing the giant's immense scale. The backdrop is a breathtaking cosmic sky with vibrant nebulae and countless stars. Detailed digital painting, painterly style, dramatic lighting, epic, mysterious, science fiction.",
