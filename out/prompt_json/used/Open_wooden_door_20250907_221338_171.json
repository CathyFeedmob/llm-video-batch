    "video_prompt": "Gentle swaying of the flowering bushes and leaves in an imperceptible breeze. Subtle twinkling and shimmering of the distant stars and milky way. A faint, slow pulse in the golden light on the horizon, as if from a distant sunrise or sunset.",
    "image_prompt": "A wide shot of an open wooden double-door leading outside, revealing a breathtaking view of the Milky Way galaxy. The doors are dark brown with brass handles and visible wood grain, partially obscuring the lower corners of the celestial scene. Lush green foliage with clusters of small pink blossoms frame the opening, adding life to the foreground and hints of a garden outside.\n\nThe sky is a deep indigo blue, transitioning to a warm, soft orange glow near the horizon, indicative of either a cosmic dawn or twilight. Countless tiny white speckles of stars fill the entire sky, with a prominent, ethereal band of the Milky Way stretching diagonally across the center, showcasing its swirling gas and dust clouds in varying shades of purples, blues, and faint browns.\n\nLong, sharp shadows from the open doors and the foliage stretch dramatically across the indoor wooden floorboards, cast by the bright external light. The overall lighting is a captivating blend of the bright, otherworldly sky and the subtly lit interior, creating a sense of wonder and transition. The composition draws the eye through the open doors to the vastness of space.\n\n**Visual elements:** Open double-door, wooden floor, green foliage, pink blossoms, starry night sky, Milky Way galaxy.\n**Style:** Realistic yet ethereal, with a touch of fantasy/surrealism due to the accessible cosmic view.\n**Composition:** Wide shot, central focus on the opening, framing elements in the foreground, strong diagonal elements from the Milky Way and shadows.\n**Colors:** Deep indigo, various purples and blues for the galaxy, vibrant green, soft pink, dark brown, brass, warm orange and yellow for the horizon glow, subtle hints of gray for the floor.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic contrast between indoor shadows and outdoor luminosity. Bright, soft light from the cosmic horizon, backlighting the foliage.\n**Atmosphere:** Dreamy, awe-inspiring, serene, magical, transcendent.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Suddenly, the wooden doors violently slam open, splintering at the hinges! The flowering bushes writhe and whip, their blossoms exploding into a fiery mist. The very stars hurtle across the sky, leaving burning trails as the milky way erupts into a swirling vortex of incandescent gas. On the horizon, the golden light pulsates with blinding intensity, then bursts forth in a cataclysmic, all-consuming flare. The floorboards buckle, cracks racing towards the viewer!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The flowering bushes and leaves, detached from their stems, ascend slowly towards the brilliant stars, their blossoms morphing into constellations of light. The milky way spins into an ethereal vortex, swallowing the golden horizon as stars pulse and fracture into shimmering dust motes that float upwards, defying gravity. Time compresses, reversing the movement, as the starry fragments reform into the milky way and the bushes descend, petals now translucent, before disappearing into the solid door frame. The door then closes itself, its wood melting into liquid gold, before reforming.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Medium shot of open French doors framing a dazzling Milky Way. The camera slowly pushes in, highlighting the subtle dance of flowering bushes and leaves, their pink blossoms catching a faint golden glow from the horizon. As the camera dollies closer, the distant stars begin to shimmer with a growing intensity, hinting at something immense beyond. A slow zoom into the golden light on the horizon reveals it pulsing with a gentle, rhythmic beat, filling the doorway with an ethereal warmth that beckons the viewer forward.",
