    "video_prompt": "A slight sway in the character's long hair, subtle blinking of the eyes, gentle rise and fall of the chestplate suggesting breathing, faint glow and flicker from the mechanical joints and panels, the long extensions on the character's back slightly shifting as if adjusting, and imperceptible dust motes drifting across the light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a detailed sci-fi mech suit worn by a young woman, set against a bright, airy, and slightly hazy futuristic urban landscape.\n\n**Subject:**\nA young, fair-skinned woman with long, straight brown hair, with a small green ribbon on one side, and striking green eyes. She has a serious but determined expression, looking slightly downward and to her left. She is integrated into a large, intricate, and heavily armored mech suit.\n\n**Mech Suit Details:**\nThe mech suit is predominantly dark green and black with significant white paneling and bright cyan glowing accents. It has multiple articulated sections, exposed hydraulic components, wires, and glowing blue lights integrated into its design.\n*   **Torso:** The upper body is bulky, armor-plated with white sections over the shoulders and chest area. Mechanical components and wires are visible around the neck and waist.\n*   **Arms:** One arm is raised, holding a futuristic black pistol with yellow glowing details. The other arm, though mostly obscured, appears equally armored.\n*   **Legs:** The legs are robust and heavily armored, with broad, flat feet/blades that extend downwards, ending in sharp points. They feature cyan glowing strips along the edges and yellow glowing accents in other areas.\n*   **Back/Shoulders:** Large, multi-jointed mechanical arms or weapon systems extend from the back and shoulders, curving upwards and outwards, with their own glowing blue indicators. These structures are substantial, indicating heavy-duty military or industrial capabilities.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:**\n*   **Full Body, Slightly Angled:** The character is depicted from head to toe, slightly angled, providing a clear view of the mech suit's structure.\n*   **Dynamic Pose:** The pose implies movement or readiness, with the pistol raised.\n*   **High Vantage Point:** The perspective suggests the mech is airborne or standing on a very tall structure, looking down over the city.\n\n**Environment/Background:**\n*   **Hazy Urban Landscape:** The background shows a sprawling, indistinct futuristic city, heavily blurred and desaturated, giving a sense of vast height and atmosphere.\n*   **Fog/Haze:** There's a noticeable atmospheric haze, possibly fog or cloud, that blurs the distant buildings and creates a bright, almost ethereal quality.\n*   **Sparse Details:** Very few discernible buildings or structures are clear, emphasizing the character and mech.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Bright, Diffused Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit, likely from above and slightly behind, suggesting daytime with some overcast conditions or strong atmospheric light diffusion.\n*   **Subtle Shadows:** Shadows are present but soft, adding depth without harshness.\n*   **Sci-Fi Glow:** The bright cyan and subtle yellow glowing elements on the mech provide contrast and reinforce the futuristic nature.\n*   **Serene yet Potentially Tense:** The overall atmosphere is calm due to the lighting but has an underlying tension due to the armed character and powerful mech.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n*   **Dominant Greens:** Dark forest green and olive green are prominent in the mech suit.\n*   **Neutrals:** Black, grey, and white are heavily used for armor plating and mechanical parts.\n*   **Accent Colors:** Bright cyan/electric blue for glowing lights, and subtle yellow for pistol and other mech accents.\n*   **Background Hues:** Light grey, muted greens, and pale blues for the hazy cityscape.\n\n**Art Style:**\n*   **Anime/Manga Inspired Sci-Fi Illustration:** Clean lines, detailed rendering, and a blend of realistic textures with stylized character design.\n*   **Digital Painting:** Demonstrates smooth blending and intricate mechanical details typical of high-quality digital illustration.\n*   **Emphasis on Detail:** High attention to detail on the mech's components, armor, and the character's face.\n\n**Artist Style Keywords (Optional, for more specific generation):**\n*   Mecha art, future urban city, concept art, character design, cyberpunk elements (subtle).",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle hair sway, gentle eye blinks, quiet chestplate movement, faint mechanical joint flicker, slight back extension adjustments, and imperceptible dust motes drifting.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The mech's weapon arm snaps forward, glowing fiercely. Its back extensions lurch violently as if powering up for attack, accompanied by a guttural whir. The character's eyes dart open, scanning rapidly, a jolt of energy coursing through her body. The ground beneath quakes as mechanical parts grind and shift with raw power, emitting sparks and flashes of light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Long hair morphs into liquid metal, defying gravity as it flows upwards, then solidifies into crystalline branches that sprout glowing bioluminescent flora. The character's eyes become swirling galaxies, their gaze warping the background into a kaleidoscopic vortex that spirals inwards and outwards. Chest plate undulates like a rhythmic portal, exhaling ethereal whispers that solidify into phantom limbs, before dissolving into shimmering dust motes that float upwards, reversing into microscopic stars. Mechanical joints pulse with impossible colors, casting iridescent shadows that dance and twist independently of their source. Back extensions extend infinitely, weaving into a lattice of shimmering light that projects kaleidoscopic fractal patterns onto the environment, collapsing and reforming with each pulse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pulls back from a close-up on her determined eyes (subtle blink), revealing the imposing mech. A sweeping arc showcases the subtle glow of the mechanical joints and panels, as her chestplate gently rises and falls (breathing). Her hair sways with a sudden head turn, revealing dusty motes catching the light. The back extensions subtly shift, preparing for unseen action.",
