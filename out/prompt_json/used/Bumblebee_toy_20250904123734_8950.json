  "video_prompt": "A hand squeezes a tube, dispensing a wavy, glossy golden paint stream. The paint pools dynamically around the feet of a yellow robot. The robot's eyes glow, and its expression shifts from worried to slightly embarrassed with subtle cheek blushes. The liquid paint reflects light, contrasting with the dark surface.",
  "image_prompt": "Highly detailed shot: a human hand squeezes golden, metallic paint from a yellow tube, forming a glossy, wavy stream. The paint pools around the feet of a yellow and black, Bumblebee-like robot figurine with glowing blue eyes and a worried expression. Soft, diffused lighting, shallow depth of field, dark contrasting surface, light gray background.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A hand actively squeezes a tube, propelling a flowing stream that dynamically expands. The liquid gathers and spreads, continually changing shape around a robot's base. The robot's eyes intensify with a pulsing glow, and its expression subtly shifts from apprehension to mild self-consciousness as a gentle blush develops on its face. Reflections actively dance and move across the liquid's shifting surface."
