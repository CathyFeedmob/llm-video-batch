    "video_prompt": "**Prompt:** The butterfly's wings subtly flutter, and its antennae twitch. Tiny golden particles twinkle and drift through the air, with some appearing and disappearing around the butterfly's wing tips. The background bokeh lights gently shimmer and shift.",
    "image_prompt": "Generate a highly detailed and vibrant close-up shot of a magnificent butterfly perched among small white flowers and lush green foliage. The butterfly's wings should display a stunning iridescence, with hues of shimmering blue and gold dominating. The top wings are predominantly blue, transitioning to gold towards the body, while the bottom wings showcase a broader golden area with hints of iridescent blue and a distinctive tail-like extension at the bottom of the hindwings, tipped with a glowing light effect. Black and subtle gold patterns outline the wing edges and veins. The butterfly's body should be a furry, vibrant blue, with delicate antennae capped with glowing tips.\n\nThe composition is a vertical portrait, with the butterfly centrally placed, slightly angled to the right, showcasing its open wings. The background should be a soft, dreamy bokeh effect, featuring blurred green leaves, hints of distant white flowers, and numerous glowing golden and bluish bokeh circles of varying sizes. Tiny, sparkling glitters and faint lens flares should be scattered throughout the scene, especially around the butterfly and in the background, creating a magical and ethereal atmosphere. The lighting is warm and glowing, highlighting the butterfly's iridescent wings and the sparkling elements. A subtle warm glow emanates from parts of the butterfly's wings.\n\nAt the bottom right corner, there are gold-colored, stylized characters \"c29\". The overall style should be hyperrealistic with a touch of fantasy, emphasizing delicate details, vibrant colors, and soft lighting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here's a refined prompt focusing *exclusively* on motion, changes, and expression:\n\n**Refined Prompt:** Butterfly wing **fluttering subtly**, antennae **twitching**. **Golden particles appearing, disappearing, and drifting** around it. Background bokeh lights **gently shimmering and shifting**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Prompt:** The butterfly's wings violently lash, body heaving as iridescent dust explodes from its form. Antennas whip, crackling with energy as the golden particles ignite, flaring into blinding bursts. The background bokeh lights contort, twisting into vortexes of swirling color, mirroring the sudden, chaotic surge of power emanating from the agitated creature.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The butterfly's wings ripple through shifting dimensions, each flutter painting new patterns of starlight on the air. Golden particles, like escaping dreams, coalesce from the ether, briefly solidify into miniature galaxies on its wingtips, then dissolve into swirling cosmic dust. The background bokeh lights distort, bending space and time, revealing glimpses of alternate realities before collapsing back into shimmering nothingness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic close-up begins on the butterfly's iridescent wing, slowly revealing tiny, glittering particles swirling around its tip. The camera dramatically zooms out, following the butterfly's graceful, arcing flight through a sun-dappled glade. A final, sweeping shot captures the butterfly landing flawlessly amidst shimmering bokeh lights, its antennae twitching, as the golden particles softly dissipate around it.",
