  "video_prompt": "A colossal warship slowly drifts through an apocalyptic, ochre sky. Viscous, blood-red liquid drips from its underside, falling towards roaring flames that engulf the landscape below. Thick plumes of smoke rise and swirl, merging with billowy orange clouds. A small figure dangles precariously from the ship. Below, two silhouetted figures walk across scorched earth, their path illuminated by the intense, shifting glow of the fires reflecting on wet terrain. In the distance, a molten-looking sea slowly churns around skeletal ruins.",
  "image_prompt": "A colossal airborne dark grey warship, its underside dripping with viscous, blood-red substance, looms diagonally bow-up-left, with a smaller vessel floating nearby. This ominous scene unfolds under a hazy, ochre-orange sky filled with billowy clouds, above a desolate, apocalyptic landscape consumed by roaring, vibrant flames and thick dark smoke. A tiny solitary figure dangles from the main warship, while in the foreground, two silhouetted human figures walk away on scorched, wet terrain reflecting the fire. In the far distance, skeletal structures of wrecked warships and spire-like ruined city towers rise from the fiery expanse. Intensely atmospheric, high detail, dominated by fiery reds, oranges, and dark greys with dramatic lighting.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A warship slowly drifts as the sky's ochre tones subtly shift and undulate. Viscous liquid, appearing blood-red, drips from its underside, falling towards roaring flames spreading across the landscape. Thick plumes of smoke actively rise, swirl, and merge with billowy orange clouds. A figure dangles and sways precariously from the ship. Below, two figures walk, their silhouetted forms shifting with the intense glow of reflecting fires. In the distance, a molten sea slowly churns, revealing and obscuring ruins."
