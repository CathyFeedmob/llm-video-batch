    "video_prompt": "The Little Prince's golden cape gently sways. The paper clouds subtly flutter. The tiny white specks resembling stars or dust particles softly drift. The paper trees on the planet slightly rustle.",
    "image_prompt": "A visually striking, full-body portrait of a character reminiscent of \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, crafted in a detailed quilling or papercut art style. The character, with light yellow hair and blue clothing, stands central on a stylized, light cream-colored planet with a yellow ring, akin to Saturn. The planet has cut-out openings and is adorned with various quilled elements: some appearing as colorful, tight spirals (pink and blue), and others as green, fan-shaped trees.\n\nA long, flowing yellow \"scarf\" or tail extends from behind the character, curving upwards and to the left, mimicking a celestial arc. The background is a flat, solid grey, with scattered small white circular elements and white, fan-shaped quilled clouds or stars.\n\nThe overall style should emphasize the layered, dimensional quality of quilling or paper art, with subtle shadows and depth to highlight the individual paper strips. The lighting is even and soft, creating a gentle, dreamlike atmosphere. The composition is balanced and engaging, drawing the eye to the central figure and his miniature world. The color palette is dominated by creams, yellows, blues, and grey, with accents of green and pink. The scene evokes a sense of whimsical fantasy and childlike wonder. No text or watermarks are present.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Golden cape gently swaying. Paper clouds subtly fluttering. Tiny white specks softly drifting. Paper trees on the planet slightly rustling.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The Little Prince's golden cape SWIRLS VIOLENTLY, whipping around him. The paper clouds EXPLODE outward, scattering fragments. The tiny white specks SHOOT across the screen like meteors. The paper trees on the planet JOLT AND TEAR, their leaves thrashing wildly. The planet itself RUMBLES and SHAKES, its rings vibrating erratically.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The Little Prince's golden cape unfurls into a celestial river, reversing its flow. Paper clouds expand, then implode into swirling galaxies. Tiny white specks, now shimmering eyes, float upwards, becoming constellations. The paper trees on the planet, morphing into delicate crystal structures, begin to sing, their melodies bending light and warping the planet into a pulsating heart, defying all known physics.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic close-up: the Little Prince's golden cape flares dramatically as a gust of wind (implied by the swooping camera) passes. Paper clouds ripple and unfurl. The camera pushes in on a tiny White speck as it ascends, then pivots to reveal the prince's subtle smile. A sweeping crane shot reveals the miniature planet as paper trees bow dramatically, their leaves rustling.",
