    "video_prompt": "Tiny, subtle movements in the cat character, like a slight twitch of an ear or the soft puffing of breath could bring the image to life. The cape could gently sway. Slight flickering of light in the distant sky could create an illusion of movement.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of a cute, chubby, fluffy anthropomorphic orange tabby cat, standing upright like a human. The cat is armored like Thor, wearing a detailed blue and gold Norse-inspired chest plate with circular silver accents, gold armbands, and a flowing vibrant red cape behind its shoulders. Its paws are visible, with small, soft toe beans. The cat holds a realistic, metallic Mjolnir hammer firmly in its right hand, the handle textured and reddish-brown. The cat has wide, expressive, round black eyes with light reflections, and its mouth is slightly open in a surprised or awestruck expression, showing small teeth and a pink tongue.\n\nThe cat stands on a dark, rough, slightly uneven ground surface, with small pebbles and dirt visible. Extending from the bottom center of the frame and going towards the cat's feet, there is a vivid, shimmering rainbow path or bridge, showing distinct colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) that appear somewhat wet or reflective.\n\nThe background is a vast, cosmic night sky, filled with sparkling golden and blue nebulous light and countless small, blurry, bokeh-like stars and cosmic dust. The overall lighting is dramatic and magical, with glows coming from the cosmic background illuminating parts of the cat, especially around its head and shoulders. The mood is wondrous and heroic. Hints of light orange glow are present in the upper left of the background, contrasting with the dominant blues and purples.\n\n**Style:** High-resolution, hyperrealistic, fantastical, Pixar-animation inspired, detailed fur and textures, soft cinematic lighting, depth of field.\n\n**Composition:** Full body shot, centered subject, low angle perspective emphasizing the cat's heroic stance, strong vertical lines, and a leading line from the rainbow.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominantly dark cosmic blues and purples, golden celestial light, vibrant red (cape), royal blue and gold (armor), and the bright, saturated colors of the rainbow. Orange and cream for the cat's fur.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Magical, awe-inspiring, heroic, cute, whimsical.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refined Prompt:\n\nSubtle ear twitches and soft breath puffs animate the cat. The cape gently sways. Distant sky flickers with light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive surge of Mjolnir's cosmic energy emanating from the cat, cracking the ground and causing the rainbow bridge to violently ripple and expand. The cat's cape whips into a frenzy; its fur bristles with an intense electrical charge. Distant stars pulsate and streak across the sky as the cat roars, launching itself with incredible speed, a blur of golden fur and crimson cape, leaving a swirling vortex of energy in its wake.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cat's fur ripples like cosmic dust, and its cape disintegrates into a nebula of shimmering stars. Mjolnir melts into a rainbow river, defying gravity and flowing upwards into shattered fragments of the moon. The cat's eyes become swirling galaxies, breathing out miniature universes that expand and contract. Its paws sink into the ground, pulling the earth upwards until it wraps around the cat like a soft blanket, becoming an interstellar cradle.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**(Opening shot: Slow, deliberate camera push-in on the cat's face)** Tiny, wide-eyed twitch as the camera dramatically reverses, revealing the Thor-clad cat (medium shot). The red cape billows majestically (cinematic, sweeping camera pan), revealing a shimmering Rainbow Road (dolly zoom). A powerful hammer-strike (dynamic, quick zoom-in to hammer impact), sending ripples through the ground as distant stars pulsate (subtle, ethereal light changes). The cat emits a low growl, eyes burning with resolve (tight close-up, dramatic lighting shift).",
