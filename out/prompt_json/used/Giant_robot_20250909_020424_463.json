    "video_prompt": "A slight sway to the mech, as if shifting its weight. The girl's hair subtly rustles, and her chest slowly rises and falls with a deep breath. Faint green light flickers across the cybernetic displays within the cockpit. Dust motes gently drift in the air around the mech's feet.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down into key elements:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA colossal, highly detailed, dark gray and black bipedal mech suit stands in a vast, desolate desert landscape. The mech has glowing green accents on its joints, chest, and arms. Its design is intricate, showcasing numerous panels, hydraulic elements, and connectors, giving it a realistic, functional appearance. The central torso houses a large, spherical, transparent cockpit with a glossy finish. Inside, a young woman with long, brown hair and headphones sits comfortably in a pilot's chair, wearing a light blue top and white shorts. Her expression is calm. Behind her and surrounding her within the cockpit are multiple holographic green screens displaying lines of code and data. The mech's arms are long and articulated, ending in multi-fingered hands. The legs are thick and sturdy, anchored firmly to the ground. In the background, rolling sand dunes and distant, jagged mountains can be seen under a bright, overcast sky. Scattered debris and rocks litter the immediate foreground and midground. On the lower right, faintly visible, \"c29\" is present. On the top left, faint Chinese characters are visible.\n\n**Style & Composition:**\nRealistic, cinematic, and slightly sci-fi. The composition is a full-body shot of the mech, framed from a low-angle perspective, emphasizing its immense scale and dominance over the landscape. The mech is positioned centrally, taking up most of the vertical space. The wide-angle shot creates depth, with the desert stretching into the horizon.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are dark grays, blacks, and metallic tones for the mech. Vibrant, electric green for the glowing accents and holographic displays. Muted, earthy tones of beige and light brown for the desert sand and mountains. Light blue for the pilot's top. The sky is a soft, light gray/white.\n\n**Lighting:**\nSoft, diffused natural daylight from an overcast sky, creating subtle shadows and highlighting the metallic surfaces of the mech. The green glowing elements within the mech provide internal illumination to the cockpit and a distinct glow to the exterior accents.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nPowerful, technologically advanced, and slightly serene, despite the desolate setting. A sense of awe and quiet purpose.\n\n**Camera:**\nWide-angle lens, low-angle shot, bringing the viewer to eye level with the mech's lower body, emphasizing its height.\n\n**Keywords:**\nMecha, giant robot, pilot, cockpit, futuristic, sci-fi, desert, desolate, detailed, realistic, cinematic, green glow, powerful, machinery.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Mech subtly shifts weight, swaying. Girl's hair gently rustles, chest slowly rising and falling. Faint green display flickers. Dust motes drift around mech's feet.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A GIANT mech, CRASHING its foot down, shaking the ground. Dust billows violently, obscuring the landscape before EXPLODING outwards. The cockpit screen SHATTERS into a million shards as the girl inside screams, her hair whipping around as if caught in a HURRICANE. Sparks fly, gears Grind, and the mech's arm SWINGS with devastating force, leaving a destructive trail. The entire scene pulsates with raw, uncontrolled energy!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The mech's limbs slowly uncoil, extending impossibly towards a shimmering sky as the girl levitates serenely from her seat, her form rippling into pure light. Dust motes coalesce into glowing orbs, then dissolve through the ground, which itself folds inward like paper. The green cockpit glow bleeds outwards, transforming into swirling nebulae that absorb the entire scene, only to reform as a miniature cosmos reflected in the mech's polished surface.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle shot reveals the colossal mech, its bulk subtly shifting, the ground imperceptibly trembling. The camera slowly dollies up to the cockpit. Inside, the girl’s chest performs a shallow, weary breath, her hair gently rustles against the hum of the mech. Green data streams flicker across displays. A dust devil swirls around the mech's metallic feet, hinting at a vast, desolate landscape.",
