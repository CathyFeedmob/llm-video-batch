  "video_prompt": "The numbers \"2029\" shift and reconfigure, with internal glowing lights pulsating blue and purple. Golden spheres on the \"2\" spin, the \"0\" branches grow and contract, its golden fruits appearing and disappearing. A gilded filigree on the bottom \"2\" expands and retracts. The large silver gear within the \"9\" rotates, its internal mechanism whirring. Olive branches sway, and the background subtly darkens and brightens.",
  "image_prompt": "Digital rendering of \"2029\" in three-dimensional, glowing, technological-opulent style. \"20\" on top, \"29\" on bottom. Numbers are clear acrylic/glass with internal blue/purple LED-like glow and subtle grid pattern. Top \"2\" has three golden spheres. Top \"0\" is a circuit-board-like tree with golden sphere clusters. Bottom \"2\" has ornate golden filigree. Bottom \"9\" integrates a detailed silver gear. Dark, warm brown background. Two dark green olive branches frame the bottom. Small \"c29\" logo in light gold bottom right. Emphasizes translucency and glow.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "The numbers 2029 reconfigure, their forms shifting. Internal blue and purple lights pulse and glow. Golden spheres on the '2' actively spin. The '0's branches grow and contract, while golden fruits appear and disappear. A gilded filigree on the lower '2' dynamically expands and retracts. The large silver gear inside the '9' rotates, its mechanism whirring. Olive branches sway. The background subtly darkens then brightens."
