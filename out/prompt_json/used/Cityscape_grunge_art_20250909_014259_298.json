    "video_prompt": "Subtle ripple effect in the lower third mimicking a reflection, with very slow, almost imperceptible upward mist or smoke rising from the bottom. The overlaid text subtly brightens and dims, as if a soft light were passing over it. A faint, slow flickering or shimmering of light on the cityscape in the background.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA monochromatic, high-contrast digital painting depicting a stylized New York City skyline. The upper two-thirds feature a clean, crisp silhouette of buildings against a bright white background, dominated by a prominent, dark skyscraper on the right with an antenna at its peak, reminiscent of the Empire State Building or Chrysler Building to its left. The lower third transitions into abstract expressionism, with dark, dripping paint strokes resembling ink or charcoal. This \"paint\" descends from the base of the buildings, creating a sense of urban decay or melting.\n\nHandwritten script, in a loose, casual style, is integrated into the design. Some text appears faintly over buildings in the upper left, especially near the large skyscraper on the right, suggesting architectural markings or notes. A larger, more legible block of handwritten text in white or light gray cursive is prominent on the dark, painted portion of the central skyscraper and bleeding into the abstract lower section. The text reads in parts \"Che\", \"Che\", \"wind the re copy\", \"attree the arr li\", \"Clurt tre it le cass\", \"illre to\", \"yee backsi\", \"T\", \"prontod lee tho\", \"k and\".\n\nAnother smaller, fainter handwritten text section is across the bottom right, merging with the drips. The overall color palette is strictly black, white, and a range of grays, with strong emphasis on dark silhouettes against a stark white. The lighting is non-realistic, rather emphasizing graphic contrast. The composition is vertical, with a dynamic interplay between sharp architectural lines and fluid, organic paint textures. In the bottom right corner, a bold, dark, handwritten \"c29\" acts as a signature or designation. The atmosphere is artistic, urban, and somewhat melancholic or gritty.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle water-like undulations expand from the bottom edge. Wisps of vapor ascend slowly and dissipate. The overlaid text gently pulses with changing luminosity. The distant cityscape exhibits a soft, wavering glow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The city violently shimmers, buildings warp and writhe like liquid. Black ink explodes upwards, consuming the skyline in a furious, churning vortex. The text lashes across the sky, crackling with raw energy before vanishing in a blinding flash.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The city, a spectral mirage, slowly inverts, buildings sinking into the sky. Ink-drip waterfalls ascend from the ground, morphing into ghostly script that writes itself backward, then disintegrates into starlight. The \"c29\" flickers like a distant neon sign, then becomes a flock of iridescent butterflies, momentarily illuminating a swirling void where the city once was, before dissipating into pure thought.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A subtle ripple effect in the lower third mimicking a reflection. Very slow, almost imperceptible upward mist or smoke rises from the bottom. The overlaid text subtly brightens and dims. A faint, slow flickering or shimmering of light on the cityscape in the background. A slow, dramatic zoom-in on the text as the ripples intensify.",
