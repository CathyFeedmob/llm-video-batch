  "video_prompt": "Golden-armored warriors on horseback advance. Horses' legs move rhythmically. Spears subtly sway. Feather plumes on helmets gently shift. Two foot soldiers walk in sync behind them. The procession actively approaches a multi-tiered temple complex. Subtle changes in light indicate progression. \n",
  "image_prompt": "Generate an eye-level, highly detailed image of an ancient Chinese warrior procession. Three warriors on horseback in golden scale armor with blue fabric accents and feathered helmets, their faces painted with feline features, dominate the foreground. Two warriors on foot follow closely behind. All carry upright spears. The horses are brown and black with matching golden harnesses. In the background, a grand, multi-tiered ancient Chinese temple complex with green, brown, and red roofs and a surrounding wall stands under a clear, hazy blue sky. The ground is paved stone. Soft, even lighting highlights the textures and depth, conveying majestic power and tradition.",
