    "video_prompt": "Tears silently trail down her cheek, collecting at her chin. Her chest subtly rises and falls with each gentle breath. The faint glow of light from the right softly flickers, illuminating strands of her hair as they sway almost imperceptibly. Her left eye blinks slowly, catching a glimmer of the ambient light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nAnime style illustration of a young girl, about 16 years old, with shoulder-length dark brown hair with lighter brown highlights, leaning forward with her arms crossed on a surface, subtly resting her head on her stacked hands/forearms. She is crying with tears streaming down her cheeks and her eyes are partially closed, conveying sadness and deep emotion. Her skin is fair, with slight blush around her eyes and nose from crying. She wears a dark blue school uniform with white triple stripes on the cuffs of her long sleeves and possibly a white collar visible.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic and moody, with warm orange and yellow light from the upper right strongly illuminating her right side (hair, arm, shoulder) and back, creating a strong rim light effect. Cooler blue light from the upper left illuminates her left side and the background on that side. The background is blurred and out of focus, depicting indistinct city lights or interior reflections, with warm oranges and golds contrasting with cool blues and hints of darker shadows. The overall atmosphere is melancholic and introspective. Full body shot, portrait orientation.\n\n**Breakdown of elements and reasoning:**\n\n*   **Anime style illustration:** Specifies the art style directly.\n*   **Young girl, about 16 years old:** Defines the character's age range.\n*   **Shoulder-length dark brown hair with lighter brown highlights:** Describes hair color and length, noting the subtle highlights visible in the warm light.\n*   **Leaning forward with her arms crossed on a surface, subtly resting her head on her stacked hands/forearms:** Describes her posture and position. \"Subtly resting\" captures the nuance of her head not being fully supported but just touching.\n*   **Crying with tears streaming down her cheeks and her eyes are partially closed, conveying sadness and deep emotion:** Crucial emotional and facial details. \"Partially closed\" instead of fully closed or wide open.\n*   **Her skin is fair, with slight blush around her eyes and nose from crying:** Adds detail to her complexion and the effect of crying.\n*   **She wears a dark blue school uniform with white triple stripes on the cuffs of her long sleeves and possibly a white collar visible:** Specifics of her clothing, including the visible stripes. \"Possibly a white collar\" allows for slight variation as it's not clearly visible in the original.\n*   **The lighting is dramatic and moody, with warm orange and yellow light from the upper right strongly illuminating her right side (hair, arm, shoulder) and back, creating a strong rim light effect.**\n*   **Cooler blue light from the upper left illuminates her left side and the background on that side.**\n    *These two sentences are key for recreating the distinct split lighting, directionality, and color temperature. \"Rim light effect\" emphasizes the strong backlighting.*\n*   **The background is blurred and out of focus, depicting indistinct city lights or interior reflections, with warm oranges and golds contrasting with cool blues and hints of darker shadows:** Describes the background's appearance and colors, emphasizing its blurred nature. \"Indistinct city lights or interior reflections\" covers the ambiguous nature of the blurred shapes.\n*   **The overall atmosphere is melancholic and introspective:** Defines the mood and feeling of the image.\n*   **Full body shot, portrait orientation:** Specifies the framing. (Initially, I thought it was a tighter crop, but on review of the original, it's more of a full character shot, still vertically oriented.)",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Tears stream and gather on her chin. Her chest gently rises and falls. Light subtly flickers, illuminating swaying hair. Her left eye blinks slowly, catching a glint.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A sudden, violent tremor rips through the scene, sending the girl's body lurching forward, tears flung from her eyes like shattered glass. Her hair whips and writhes around her head, infused with chaotic, erupting energy. The background lights pulse erratically, growing blindingly bright, then plunging the room into oppressive darkness, as the desk violently shudders and splinters. The air crackles with unseen forces, distorting everything. Her left eye snaps open, ablaze with frantic light, as an uncontrollable sob erupts from her.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her tears, instead of falling, rewind into her eyes, shimmering like nebulae. Her breaths cause her chest to ripple sideways, warping her uniform into liquid moonlight. Hair strands, glowing with impossible hues, snake skyward, pulling ambient light into swirling vortices. Her blinking left eye detaches itself, becoming a cosmic lens that inverts the universe within its gaze, revealing impossible constellations.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, initially blurry, sharpens to reveal a tear tracing a path down her cheek. A sudden, tight zoom on her chin, catching the tear as it falls. The ambient light brightens dramatically, silhouetting her hair as a gentle breeze (unseen) causes it to sway. Her left eye slowly blinks, a single glint of light piercing the darknessâ€”a silent, intense moment.",
