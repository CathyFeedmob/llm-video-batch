    "video_prompt": "Subtle body sway and gentle hair ripple, light shimmer on suit's reflective surfaces, soft glow emanating from the background light source with slight flicker, very slow upward camera tilt revealing more of the cosmic backdrop. Particles drift gently across the frame.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image, focusing on its visual elements:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion, in her iconic red plugsuit with intricate black and grey detailing, standing on a futuristic, dark, slightly reflective metallic platform. She is looking directly at the viewer with a determined expression, her blue eyes piercing. Her long brown hair flows around her, displaying her characteristic twin pigtail buns. Massive, stylized black and red mechanical wings or support structures rise behind her, symmetrically flanking her.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic and ethereal, emanating from a bright, glowing vertical opening or light source directly behind her, creating powerful backlighting and a strong silhouette effect. This light projects a radiant glow around her figure and illuminates the underside of the mechanical structures. The background gradually fades into the blackness of space, accented by faint, scattered golden specks resembling distant stars or debris. Below the platform, the curvature of the Earth is visible, adorned with subtle orange and white lights of cities, indicative of being in orbit or at a very high altitude. The overall atmosphere is commanding, epic, and slightly melancholic.\n\n**Specific details incorporated:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Asuka Langley Soryu, full body.\n*   **Attire:** Red plugsuit, black/grey accents, twin pigtails.\n*   **Expression:** Determined, direct gaze.\n*   **Pose:** Standing, facing forward.\n*   **Background Elements:** Futuristic metallic platform, large mechanical wing-like structures behind, Earth's curvature (orbital view), distant city lights.\n*   **Lighting:** Strong backlighting from a vertical glowing source, light emanating outwards, creates silhouette.\n*   **Colors:** Predominantly red, black, and grey for the character/structures, deep space blacks, warm golden light, subtle blues/whites for Earth.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Epic, commanding, somewhat melancholic, space opera feel.\n*   **Style:** Anime-inspired, crisp lines, slight glow effects, detailed textures on suit/platform.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle body sway, hair ripple, suit shimmer, and background light flicker. Very slow upward camera tilt. Gentle particle drift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden, violent tremor shakes the suit; hair whips chaotically as if in a gale. The suit's reflective surfaces spark and crackle with raw energy. Background light pulses intensely, strobing erratically. The cosmic backdrop rips open, revealing an inferno. Particles ignite and explode across the frame.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses as suit *unforms* into liquid light, ascending. Hair *unbraids* into cosmic dust. The background light source *implodes* into a black hole, then *explodes* into nebulae, while the cosmic backdrop *unfurls* like a tapestry, revealing other dimensions. Particles *orbit* chaotically, defying motion. Time *fractures*, looping and reversing within the unfolding chaos.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-out reveals a triumphant Asuka in her shining red plugsuit, standing firm amidst cosmic debris. Twin light beams converge from behind, illuminating her and casting an otherworldly glow on the surrounding stars. As the camera subtly arcs, a low-angle shot reveals her determined gaze, reflecting the vastness of space. The scene culminates in her launching forward, her wings unfurling, silhouetted against a nebula’s fiery embrace.",
