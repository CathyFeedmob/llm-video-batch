  "image_prompt": "Generate a vertical image of two vibrant, detailed koi fish forming a yin-yang symbol in clear blue water, with a pink water lily (lotus) centrally between them. The upper fish is white, orange, and blue; the lower is red and white. Show light refraction through water, subtle ripples, and air bubbles. The water's blue deepens towards the bottom. The overall scene should evoke tranquility and natural beauty.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Koi fish fluidly glide and undulate, their fins subtly propelling them in an elegant, continuous circle. Their scales shimmer as light playfully dances and refracts, casting shifting patterns across their bodies and the water. Gentle ripples continuously expand and fade, demonstrating the water's dynamic, responsive surface."
