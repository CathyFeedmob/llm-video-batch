  "video_prompt": "Ethereal light rays slowly pierce through a dusty, hazy atmosphere, descending from above. Countless dust motes gently dance and shimmer within these beams, illuminating the vast space. Two figures, their backs turned, subtly shift their heads, captivated by the overwhelming scale. Their long shadows gently stretch and sway on the uneven stone floor as the overhead light subtly brightens and dims.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed but concise):**\n\"A colossal, towering cylindrical library interior. Immense curved bookshelves stretch infinitely upwards, packed with countless ancient, well-worn books, featuring aged leather bindings in faded muted colors (browns, reds, greens, blues). Brilliant natural light streams through a large circular skylight, casting ethereal god rays through a dusty, hazy atmosphere. On the uneven stone floor in the foreground, two tiny figures (a child in a dark gown with curly hair, and an adult in earth-toned clothing) stand with their backs to the viewer, casting long dramatic shadows. Piles of old books and manuscripts litter the floor. Awe-inspiring, mystical, and profound quiet, evoking a sense of discovery and boundless knowledge.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More concise):**\n\"Colossal cylindrical library, towering curved bookshelves filled with countless ancient, faded books. Bright circular skylight casts ethereal light rays through a dusty, hazy atmosphere. Two small figures (child and adult, backs to viewer) stand on an uneven stone floor littered with old books, casting long shadows. Awe-inspiring, mystical, profound quiet.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Very concise, focusing on core elements):**\n\"Vast cylindrical library with infinitely tall, curved bookshelves packed with ancient, faded books. Circular skylight with dramatic god rays through dust. Two tiny figures in foreground (child, adult, backs to viewer) on a stone floor with scattered books. Awe-inspiring, mystical atmosphere.\"",
