    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze blows from the left, slightly swaying the blonde hair and causing a few red leaves to drift diagonally from top left to bottom right. The sunlight subtly flickers, creating a soft shimmer across the metallic armor.",
    "image_prompt": "A **half-body view** of a **young woman with long, flowing blonde hair**, positioned towards the left of the frame but looking slightly to the right, in a **fantasy, anime-inspired style**.\n\n**Visual Elements and Character:**\n*   **Character:** Young woman with fair skin, delicate features, and striking **cyan-blue eyes**. Her nose is small and slightly upturned, and her lips are full with a natural, light pink hue.\n*   **Hair:** Long, straight, golden blonde hair cascading over her shoulders and back, with some strands blowing gently in the wind.

There are distinct sparkles and reflections on the metallic surfaces.\n*   **Shadows:** Soft shadows are present, indicating a clear light source but without harsh contrasts.\n*   **Atmosphere:** A serene, ethereal, and slightly melancholic atmosphere.

    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movement & Change:** Blonde hair delicately sways. Red leaves drift diagonally. Sunlight subtly flickers, causing armor to shimmer. **No static descriptions.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A powerful gale erupts from the left, violently thrashing the blonde hair, ripping free a cascade of red leaves that spiral chaotically downwards. The metallic armor catches exploding sunlight, flaring with blinding intensity. The ground beneath sheers and buckles, a fissure tearing open. The sword pulsates with crackling energy, sparks flying.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Reverse gravity pulls red leaves upwards into the sky, morphing into crimson butterflies that pulse with light. Her hair, now liquid gold, cascades upwards, forming ethereal, glowing tendrils that intertwine with the shimmering armor, which dissolves into a flowing river of polished mercury, reflecting distorted, impossible landscapes. The sword, now a fractal of shattered light, spirals into timelessness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, initially wide, slowly pans right, revealing the vast field and the distant mountains. As the breeze picks up, the camera subtly zooms in, focusing on the shimmering light playing across the armor. A red leaf, caught in a dramatic updraft, briefly pauses mid-air before spiraling down, narrowly missing the camera, as the focus sharpens on the warrior's resolute gaze.",
