    "video_prompt": "Long hair softly blows to the left, strands gently fall over the face, lips subtly part and close. Light snow particles drift downwards across the frame.",
    "image_prompt": "A full-body shot of a young woman seated, with her long, dark brown hair blowing around her face and shoulders. She is wearing a light grey, pleated, sleeveless dress with a high slit revealing her leg. Her left arm is resting on her knee, and her right hand is placed on a light-colored surface she is sitting on. She has fair skin, pink lips, and dark eyes. The background is a soft, muted grey, and there are small, out-of-focus white specks or glitter appearing to float in the air, creating a dreamlike or ethereal atmosphere. The lighting is soft and bright, casting gentle highlights on her hair and skin. The composition focuses on her, with her face slightly turned towards the viewer, and the overall mood is serene and somewhat melancholic. In the bottom right corner, a stylized logo or text \"c29\" is visible.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Hair cascades left, obscuring then revealing face. Lips part, then close. Snowflakes drift and fall throughout the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A gale-force wind rips through, violently whipping long hair leftward, individual strands thrashing and clawing at the face. Lips rapidly contort and snap open, then slam shut. A maelstrom of sharp, crystalline shards bursts horizontally across the frame, then violently implodes. The backdrop shatters, revealing a chaotic void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A flowing cascade of black hair, now an independent entity, levitates upwards, each strand a shimmering wormhole opening to reveal miniature, swirling galaxies, defying gravity as the \"snowflakes\" (actually shards of shattered time from future) rise and coalesce into an ethereal, pulsating orb above the woman's head. Her lips stretch into a dizzying infinite loop of smiles, each radiating a different color of the rainbow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A close-up shot of her face, wind blowing her long hair dramatically across her face as her lips part slightly, then a slow zoom-out revealing the \"snow\" is actually falling debris from a crumbling ceiling. Her eyes dart nervously, reflecting distant fiery glows, as the camera pans down her body, revealing a worn, torn dress. Her hand reaches out tentatively, then clenches into a fist, showcasing determination. The frame ends with a sudden, rapid zoom back to her intensely focused eyes.",
