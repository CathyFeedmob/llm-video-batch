    "video_prompt": "A large wave of orange liquid crests and froths over a blue car in a desert landscape. The orange liquid subtly drips and splatters, with droplets falling and splashing on the sand. The turbulent blue liquid in the wave's hollow moves realistically. Subtle dust particles drift in the air around the car. The man on the car's roof gently sways with the vehicle's movement. The car's tires subtly kick up sand and tiny rocks as it moves forward. The desert plants gently rustle in an imperceptible breeze. The shadows cast by the objects subtly shift as if a cloud passes overhead.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-angle, cinematic shot captures a vibrant and surreal desert scene at daylight. A striking, massive wave of molten gold liquid and turquoise water is the central focus, arching dramatically over a blue retro car with a man waving from its roof, creating a powerful sense of motion and wonder. The desert foreground is sandy orange with scattered sparse vegetation and rocks, adding to the arid beauty. The background reveals majestic orange mountains under a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds to the right, and the the top left corner is a close up of the molten gold liquid mixed with droplets. The entire image is rendered in a highly detailed, illustrative style with sharp focus on all elements, vibrant colors, and dynamic lighting that enhances the golden liquid's sheen and casts subtle shadows on the desert floor.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Orange liquid violently crests, froths, drips, splatters, and splashes over a moving blue car. Droplets hit the sand. Turbulent blue liquid swirls within the wave. Dust particles drift. A man sways on the car's roof as it moves forward, kicking up sand and tiny rocks. Desert plants subtly rustle, and shadows shift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A monstrous orange wave, a liquid inferno, explosively crashes down. The blue car, propelled by unseen forces, violently jerks and spins as the wave engulfs it. Debris and liquid globules explode from the impact, spraying wildly. The man on the roof flails, battling the sudden onslaught. Desert plants whip and thrash, uprooted and sent flying. Shadows writhe and dance, then abruptly vanish as the very air around the car shimmers and distorts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A colossal, shimmering wave of molten gold liquid defies gravity, cresting perpetually over a perpetually falling, azure quantum car. Droplets of solidified light float upwards, splintering into fractal dust. The desert sand undulates like liquid metal, mirroring the car's replaying tire tracks. A shimmering phantom of the man on the roof dissolves into the golden wave, their form rippling through impossible dimensions. Ancient desert flora blooms and retracts instantly, their shadows elongating into surreal tunnels that swallow the fading light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, sweeping crane shot reveals a colossal orange wave engulfing a blue car in a vast desert. As the wave crests with a visceral splash, the camera rapidly zooms onto the driver, who defiantly raises his fist. A quick pan follows the car rocketing through the liquid, then a rapid reverse zoom pulls back, showcasing the grand scale of the surreal event. The scene climaxes with a slow-motion shot of orange droplets cascading onto the sand and a final, lingering close-up on a ripple.",
