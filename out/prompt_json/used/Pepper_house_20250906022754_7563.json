  "image_prompt": "A meticulously designed, cozy room inside a hollowed-out green bell pepper, featuring a living area with a sofa, desk, and bookcase, and a bedroom with a queen-sized bed, nightstands, and armchair. The inner walls are textured and slightly translucent, complementing the muted green interior. Green vines cascade from the top, and the pepper rests on a base of moss and foliage. The background is a plain light gray wall.",
