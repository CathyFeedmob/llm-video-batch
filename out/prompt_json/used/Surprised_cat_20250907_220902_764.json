    "video_prompt": "The cat slowly blinks, its whiskers twitch, and its chest subtly rises and falls as if breathing. There's a slight rustling sound effect accompanying the movement.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, realistic photograph of a black and white cat, its head and front paws emerging through a ragged, torn hole in a plain white surface. The cat has wide open, golden-yellow eyes with black pupils, looking directly at the viewer with an expression of surprise or curiosity. Its pink nose and mouth are visible, and its sharp white fangs are slightly showing, adding to its surprised look. Long, delicate white whiskers fan out from its snout. The fur on its face is a mix of black and white, while its paws are white with visible pink toe beans. Through the torn edges of the white surface, a vibrant, solid yellow background is visible, creating a strong contrast with the white and the cat's fur. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the textures of the cat's fur and the torn paper. The composition is a frontal close-up, focusing entirely on the cat and the torn opening, creating a sense of immediacy and interaction.\n\n**Artistic style:** Realistic photography with high detail.\n**Composition:** Close-up, centered on the cat's face and paws within the torn opening. The cat's face fills the majority of the torn hole.\n**Lighting:** Bright, soft, and even, emphasizing textures and colors.\n**Colors:** Dominant white and black of the cat, bright golden-yellow for the background, with touches of pink for nose/paw pads.\n**Atmosphere:** Playful, surprising, curious.\n**Photographic aspects:** Sharp focus on the cat's face and paws, shallow depth of field to subtly blur the very edges of the torn paper if needed, but not the cat.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The cat's eyes slowly narrow then widen, its whiskers subtly flicking. Its body expands and contracts with a gentle rhythm. A soft rustling accompanies the minimal motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The ripped paper violently tears open further, revealing the cat's wide, glowing eyes. Its fangs elongate sharply as it lunges forward, claws ripping the paper to shreds. A ferocious snarl erupts, and a shockwave of energy bursts from its expanding paws, shattering the surrounding space into fragments.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cat spontaneously disassembles into a swirling vortex of fur and golden eyes, then reassembles inside out within the paper, its paws phasing through, leaving trails of inverted color. The paper pulses, then flows like liquid, engulfing the cat before blooming into a universe where whiskers become nebulae and purrs echo as cosmic hums.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow zoom reveals a black and white cat's wide, golden eyes peeking through a ragged tear in white paper. The cat's pupils slowly constrict and dilate, accompanied by a subtle, deep rustling sound. Its pink nose twitches, then one paw slowly extends, claws just visible, tapping the paper dramatically. The background shifts to a vibrant, glowing yellow, intensifying the suspense.",
