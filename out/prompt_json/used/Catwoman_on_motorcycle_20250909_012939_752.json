    "video_prompt": "A subtle shift in wind causes sections of her red hair to gently sway. Her right eye subtly blinks. The city lights in the background show a very subtle shimmer, and the reflections on the wet ground gently ripple. The glow from the motorbike's small lights slightly pulsates.",
    "image_prompt": "A full-body eye-level shot of Catwoman, in a sleek black leather suit with a long-sleeved top and tight pants, and a black mask, riding a black motorcycle. Her right foot is on the ground, and her left foot is on the motorcycle footrest. Her body is positioned at an angle, facing forward while looking at the viewer. Her long red hair cascades over her shoulders. She points a small black pistol forward, holding it with both hands. The motorcycle has a glowing yellow Batman logo and two round headlights on the back. The setting is a wet, dark city street at night, illuminated by city lights reflecting on the ground. A large full moon takes up most of the upper background, with tall, lit-up buildings on either side. The atmosphere is suspenseful and edgy, with dynamic lighting. The art style is a blend of realistic comic book art and digital painting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Her red hair subtly sways in sections. Her right eye gently blinks. The city lights in the background shimmer faintly. Ripples disturb the reflections on the wet ground. The motorbike's small lights pulsate softly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her red hair whips violently around her head. Her right eye snaps wide open, pupils dilating intensely. City lights in the background burst into blinding flares, buildings lurching and twisting. Reflections on the wet ground explode into geysers of water, defying gravity. The motorbike's small lights crackle with aggressive energy, pulsating erratically before exploding into sparks.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The motorbike's tires morph into shimmering lunar dust, propelling Catwoman effortlessly upwards towards the colossal moon, which subtly shrinks into a glowing cat's eye. Her hair, now liquid gold, streams downwards, defying gravity, as the city lights stretch and ripple into abstract constellations, and the ground below transforms into a reflective, starry nebula.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle dolly shot begins on the motorbike's glowing lights, subtly pulsating as it inches forward. A soft breeze stirs Catwoman's red hair, building into a dramatic sweep as the camera rapidly pulls back and upward, revealing her intense gaze and a slow, deliberate blink of her right eye, the moonlight gleaming in her pupils. Her grip tightens on the pistol, and the cityscape lights shimmer and expand outwards, reflecting in the ever-widening ripples on the wet ground. The movement concludes with a dramatic zoom-in on the iconic Bat-symbol emblazoned on the motorbike's seat.",
