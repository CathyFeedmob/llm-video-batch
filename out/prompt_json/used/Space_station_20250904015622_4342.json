  "refined_video_prompt": "Nebulae swirl and stars perpetually twinkle. A colossal ring station intensely pulsates with shifting red and orange light. Smaller glowing red spheres subtly drift and orbit around it. An elongated spaceship gracefully glides into view, its blue-white orb propulsion powerfully flaring and diminishing. Asteroids continuously drift and slowly shift, dynamically altering the foreground and background."
