  "video_prompt": "A colossal, landscape-feathered eagle-like bird soars majestically over an expansive, cloud-shrouded mountain range. Its massive wings glide rhythmically, subtly adjusting to air currents. The bird's head slowly turns, its piercing red-orange eyes scanning the panorama below, perhaps with a subtle, ancient glow. One powerful talon flexes slightly, poised to grasp. Ethereal clouds drift and swirl around the mountain peaks, constantly shifting the view. A distant river shimmers and flows through the valley. The entire scene is bathed in dynamic sunlight, with highlights and shadows subtly shifting as the bird moves and time progresses.",
