    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmering on the building's glass facade, individual people walking and vehicles moving along the roads, water rippling gently in the lake, clouds drifting slowly across the sky, and very subtle, distant air traffic movements.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Detailed Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n\"A majestic, futuristic skyscraper, predominantly white and light blue, featuring sleek, curved architectural elements and expansive glass sections. The building spirals upwards, tapering at the top with a distinctive spire design. The skyscraper is centrally positioned, dominating the frame.\n\nThe surrounding environment depicts a sprawling modern city by a large, serene body of water (possibly a lake or wide river), with numerous bridges connecting different landmasses. Lush green trees and vegetation dot the landscape around the waterfront and bridges. In the far background, a hazy urban skyline stretches towards distant mountains.\n\nThe sky is a vibrant, clear blue with fluffy white cumulus clouds scattered throughout. Numerous advanced, grey-white flying vehicles or drones are soaring in the sky at varying distances, some closer and more detailed, others smaller and further away, suggesting a bustling aerial traffic.\n\nThe overall lighting is bright and clear, indicative of a sunny day, with soft shadows creating depth and dimension on the buildings and landscape. The atmosphere is clean, futuristic, and aspirational. The composition utilizes an elevated, wide-angle perspective, capturing the grandeur of the skyscraper and the vastness of the city. There are miniature figures of people and vehicles (cars, buses) visible on the roads and walkways around the skyscraper's base, adding a sense of scale and life to the urban scene. The aesthetic is clean, high-tech, and slightly fantastical.\"\n\n**Breakdown of Prompt Elements:**\n\n*   **Subject (Skyscraper):** \"majestic, futuristic skyscraper, predominantly white and light blue, sleek, curved architectural elements, expansive glass sections, spirals upwards, tapering at the top with a distinctive spire design, centrally positioned, dominating the frame.\"\n*   **Environment (City/Water/Landscape):** \"sprawling modern city by a large, serene body of water (possibly a lake or wide river), numerous bridges connecting different landmasses, lush green trees and vegetation dot the landscape around the waterfront and bridges, hazy urban skyline stretches towards distant mountains.\"\n*   **Aerial Elements:** \"vibrant, clear blue sky with fluffy white cumulus clouds, numerous advanced, grey-white flying vehicles or drones are soaring in the sky at varying distances, some closer and more detailed, others smaller and further away, suggesting a bustling aerial traffic.\"\n*   **Lighting & Atmosphere:** \"bright and clear, indicative of a sunny day, soft shadows creating depth and dimension, clean, futuristic, aspirational.\"\n*   **Composition & Perspective:** \"elevated, wide-angle perspective, capturing the grandeur of the skyscraper and the vastness of the city.\"\n*   **Details & Scale:** \"miniature figures of people and vehicles (cars, buses) visible on the roads and walkways around the skyscraper's base, adding a sense of scale and life.\"\n*   **Style/Aesthetic:** \"clean, high-tech, slightly fantastical.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A cityscape comes alive: shimmering building facades, bustling streets with pedestrians and moving vehicles, a gently rippling lake, and clouds drifting under a sky dotted with subtle, distant air traffic.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Building's glass facade shatters outward, shards swirling into a vortex. Pedestrians erupt into chaotic sprints, vehicles swerving violently and colliding. Lake water surges upward in colossal geysers, cresting waves collapsing into impossible spirals. Clouds morph into sentient, wind-whipped entities, tearing through the sky as air traffic engages in frantic, high-speed evasive maneuvers, some exploding into fiery debris.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The futuristic tower undulates like liquid, its glass skin bleeding vibrant hues into the sky. Flying vehicles morph into schools of fish, swimming through inversed waterfalls that fall upwards. Pedestrians flow like mercury, their movements reversing and rewinding in a chaotic ballet. Distant cities pulse and shimmer, exchanging places with the floating clouds, as the lake's surface splinters into reflective shards, mirroring impossible realities.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**A sleek, futuristic skyscraper pierces the clouds, its glass facade subtly shimmering under a dramatic, shifting light.**\n\n**The camera glides downwards, revealing the bustling cityscape below.**\n\n**Air vehicles weave through the sky, their subtle movements hinting at a vibrant, unseen rhythm.**\n\n**A lone figure on a bridge pauses, watching the lake's gentle ripples, while a bus cruises by, and then the camera sweeps across the skyline with a subtle tilt, capturing the grand scope of this futuristic world.**",
