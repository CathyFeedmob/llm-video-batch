    "video_prompt": "The floating butterflies softly flutter their wings, with some strings subtly swaying. The glowing particles along the fabric gently twinkle and flow. The woman's hair and dress subtly sway with her movement, and the tip of the fabric holding the ornament gently sways. A subtle camera zoom out reveals more of the surrounding forest, which has a very gentle fog floating through the trees.",
    "image_prompt": "A fantasy-themed vertical-format image featuring a woman on an ethereal, glowing, S-shaped ribbon flowing through a mystical forest.\n\n**Visual Elements and Composition:**\n- **Central Figure:** A young woman, seen from the side, wearing a long, elegant white gown, walking gracefully on the glowing ribbon. Her brown hair is loose and appears to be blowing slightly.\n- **Ethereal Ribbon:** A wide, translucent, and iridescent ribbon sweeps upwards in a graceful 'S' shape from the bottom of the frame towards the upper right. It glows with an inner light, casting sparkles and highlights, especially towards the bottom. The ribbon appears to be made of delicate, shimmering fabric.\n- **Butterflies/Moths:** Numerous glowing butterflies or moths (some appearing to be light sources) are scattered throughout the scene, some hanging by thin threads, others seemingly floating. Their light source aligns with the overall magical ambiance.\n- **Forest Setting:** The background is a dense, enchanting forest with tall, dark tree trunks and lush green foliage. The trees are predominantly dark green and dark brown, providing a strong contrast to the bright ribbon and lights.\n- **Foreground Elements:** Dark green foliage is visible in the very foreground, obscuring the bottom of the ribbon slightly.\n- **Magical Element:** A decorative, golden, antique-looking element resembling a weight or finial is attached to the upper right end of the ribbon, hinting at its anchor.\n\n**Colors and Lighting:**\n- **Dominant Colors:** A harmonious blend of muted greens and browns for the forest, contrasting with the bright, glowing whites, golds, and light blues of the ribbon and light sources. The butterflies emit a warm, soft yellow or peach glow.\n- **Lighting:** The scene is softly lit, creating a dreamlike and mysterious atmosphere. The primary light source comes from the glowing ribbon and the illuminated butterflies. There's a subtle mist or haze in the air, enhancing the ethereal quality and contributing to the glow and depth.\n\n**Atmosphere and Style:**\n- **Atmosphere:** Magical, dreamlike, mysterious, serene, ethereal, enchanting.\n- **Style:** Fantasy art, digital painting, conceptual art. The image has a high level of detail with a painterly rendered quality, giving it a somewhat photorealistic yet fantastical appearance.\n\n**Technical Aspects:**\n- **Aspect Ratio:** Vertical (portrait).\n- **Depth:** Excellent depth of field with the foreground elements blurred, the central figures and ribbon in focus, and the background softly blurred to create a sense of distance.\n\n**Keywords:** fantasy forest, glowing ribbon, magical path, ethereal, dreamlike, luminous butterflies, enchanted, serene, mystical, sparkling light, long dress, flowing hair, fairytale, cinematic lighting, digital art, concept art.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Butterflies flutter. Strings subtly sway. Particles twinkle and flow. Hair and dress subtly sway. Fabric tip gently sways. Camera subtly zooms out, revealing more swaying fog in the forest.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**The grand finale! The fabric bursts into a chaotic whirl, violently whipping and coiling. The woman is propelled through the air, her hair and dress thrashing wildly. Butterflies ignite into fiery projectiles, careening through the forest. Luminous particles explode from the fabric, forming blinding nova bursts. Trees groan and twist, branches lashing out like enraged serpents. The ornamental tip lunges forward, dragging the collapsing fabric into a monstrous vortex.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The shimmering fabric, now water, flows upwards defying gravity, its glowing particles becoming fish that swim into the woman's hair, her dress now blossoming into a swirling galaxy. The butterflies, inverted into shadows, pull the forest out of the ground, tree roots unfurling into swirling smoke. The ornament, a living eye, blinks. Time folds in on itself, causing elements to un-form into pure light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide-angle lens slowly cranes upwards, revealing the woman bathed in ethereal light as she gracefully glides along the shimmering ribbon. As she turns, the camera slowly rotates with her, following the gentle flow of her white dress and hair. Butterflies drift in a mesmerizing dance, illuminated by the soft light reflecting off the luminous ribbon. A slow zoom-in focuses on the woman's face, her eyes reflecting the magical glow of the forest, before a dramatic sweep pans down the ribbon, revealing its full, majestic form disappearing into the misty forest.",
