    "video_prompt": "Subtle glinting across the alien's biomechanical surfaces, with faint atmospheric haze drifting in the background. The glowing elements on the alien's body and in the distant cityscape softly pulse, and a minor camera sway simulates breath or movement.",
    "image_prompt": "A digital art rendering featuring a predatory, bio-mechanical Alien Xenomorph in a futuristic, neon-lit cityscape. The creature is posed dynamically, almost crouching or leaping, with its long, sleek body covered in reflective black and dark metallic textures. The head is elongated and smooth, with a hint of an inner jaw and sharp teeth visible. Multiple tube-like appendages emerge from its back, adding to its alien anatomy.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic, with strong contrasts between deep shadows and vibrant light sources. There's a predominant cool blue ambient light coming from above, possibly from the hazy sky or distant buildings, and a warmer, orange-red glow emanating from the foreground and lower parts of the scene, illuminating the Xenomorph's underside and reflecting off its glossy surface. This red light suggests emergency lights, warning signs, or a burning city.\n\nThe background is a blurred cityscape with towering buildings outlined by bright, rectangular lights, creating a sense of scale and an overwhelming urban environment. In the foreground, partially visible structures with glowing red elements, including the alphanumeric display \"C29\", contribute to the futuristic and potentially industrial setting. The overall atmosphere is tense, eerie, and action-oriented, emphasizing the creature's menacing presence within a high-tech world. The style is hyper-realistic with sharp details, especially on the creature's texture and the glow of the lights.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle glinting across the alien's biomechanical surfaces. The alien's glowing elements softly pulse. Faint atmospheric haze drifts. Distant cityscape lights softly pulse. Minor camera sway simulates breath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Terrifying, rapid lunges of the alien, its biomechanical surfaces flashing with blinding reflections. Explosive bursts of light from its body and the pulsating cityscape. Buildings violently sway and warp, their lights flickering erratically. The ground ruptures as the alien slams down, sending debris flying. A violent camera shake mirrors the alien's aggressive movements, emphasizing its destructive power.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The alien's glossy exo-skeleton shimmers, reflecting an inverted cityscape where buildings melt upwards into cotton candy clouds. Its limbs elongate and retract like liquid tendrils, phasing through solid structures as time spirals backward, unwinding its predatory stance into a graceful, impossible dance. Distant neon glows ebb and flow, morphing into spectral flora that bloom and wither around the creature, all held in a perpetually shifting, gravity-defying kaleidoscope.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The Xenomorph, a sleek, biomechanical horror, stalks silently through a neon-drenched metropolis. Subtle glints trace its path, reflecting cityscape lights. A slow zoom in on its terrifying mandibles, highlighting the faint atmospheric haze. The camera then tracks the alien as it leaps across rooftops, its glowing elements pulsing with predatory intent, leaving the distant, pulsing cityscape in its wake.",
