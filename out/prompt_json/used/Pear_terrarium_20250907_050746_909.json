    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer on the liquid surface, gentle bobbing of the miniature house and island as if floating, slight swaying of the tree leaves, soft animation of tiny cloud particles drifting, a faint ripple through the water on the base, and a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom into the scene.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on recreating its visual elements, style, and atmosphere:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A highly detailed, miniature fairytale world encased within a clear, stylized pear-shaped glass terrarium, resembling a snow globe. The terrarium sits upright on a simple, light wooden base, with a subtle rainbow reflection on the surface below.\n\n**Glass Pear Terrarium:**\n*   The glass pear is filled with crystal clear water, creating a subtle magnifying and distorting effect, particularly on the edges.\n*   The stem of the pear is a natural brown, rooted in a vibrant green top.\n*   The interior scene floats a small, irregular island of lush green grass and tiny, colorful pebbles around its perimeter, creating a floating landmass effect within the water.\n\n**Miniature Fairytale Scene:**\n*   **Path:** A winding, miniature cobblestone path made of light-colored stones, meticulously detailed, leads through the scene.\n*   **Fungus/Mushrooms:** Several vibrant red and white polka-dotted toadstools (Amanita muscaria-like), varying in size, are scattered throughout the grass, some close to the path, others further afield.\n*   **Trees & Flora:** A prominent, well-proportioned miniature tree with a brown trunk and a dense, light green leafy canopy stands near the left side of the path. Other small, varied green flora and tiny white flowers dot the grassy landscape.\n*   **Buildings:** A charming, quaint miniature wooden house with a grey roof, small windows, and a front porch is situated on the right side of the path. Adjacent to it is a taller, slender white tower with a distinct purple, conical roof, possibly a fairy tale castle turret.\n*   **Sky/Clouds:** Inside the upper portion of the terrarium, above the water line, fluffy, pure white three-dimensional clouds reminiscent of cotton or felt are suspended, creating a whimsical sky.\n*   **Subtle Particles:** Tiny, almost imperceptible floating white particles or speckles are visible, especially in the water and slight scattering around the clouds, adding to the magical snow globe effect.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Lighting:** Soft, diffused, natural daylight, possibly from a window, creating gentle shadows and highlights on the terracotta, wooden base, and the miniature elements. There's a subtle rim lighting effect on the glass where light passes through.\n*   **Background:** A clean, solid, light grey (slightly blue-grey) studio background, uncluttered, emphasizing the terrarium.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Whimsical, magical, serene, detailed, and highly realistic macro photography style with a fantasy element.\n\n**Composition & Style:**\n*   **Composition:** Vertical orientation, centered, with the terrarium occupying the majority of the frame. The base is fully visible at the bottom.\n*   **Style:** Studio shot, hyper-realistic miniature, intricate detail, clean, high-resolution.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n*   Dominant greens, browns, light wood tones, white, red, purple, and pastel blues/pinks/greys for the pebbles. Clear water.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   No watermarks or text.\n*   Sharp focus on the terrarium and its interior.\n*   Depth of field that subtly blurs the background.\n*   The overall impression is one of a meticulously crafted, delicate, and enchanting scene.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle liquid shimmer, gentle house/island bobbing and tree leaf sway. Tiny cloud particles drift softly. A faint ripple expands on the water base. Very slow, almost imperceptible zoom in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive, chaotic liquid surges, miniature island violently spins, house shudders and fragments, pear stem writhes, clouds churn into a furious vortex, scattered mushrooms launch skyward, tree violently sheds leaves, water bursts upwards, and rapid, jarring zooms and cuts intensify the pandemonium.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses, the island ascends, house slowly detaches and floats upwards. Water shimmers, then forms inverted droplets that gracefully rise and coalesce with the aether. Clouds stretch and dissipate into swirling cosmic dust. Tree branches writhe and transform into iridescent tentacles. The entire pear shell oscillates, distorting the scene into a kaleidoscopic vortex, then reforms, leaving the house hovering at the apex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic push-in reveals the pear-globe, a luminous orb against a stark, ethereal backdrop. The camera subtly shifts, revealing the miniature world withinâ€”the house and island gently bob, the tree leaves softly sway. As we imperceptibly zoom, tiny cloud particles drift in a cosmic dance. A ripple shimmers the water, hinting at a hidden force, before a final, deliberate focus on the pear's stem, silhouetted against the deepening celestial glow.",
