  "video_prompt": "An abstract digital artwork comes alive. Luminous liquid-gold lines and swirling fractal patterns flow dynamically, resembling energetic plasma or tendrils caught in a current. These golden elements expand and converge around a dark, reflective sphere whose surface shows shifting, swirling gold patterns and emanating light. Tiny, glittering white and multi-colored energetic particles drift and sparkle against a deep blue-black void. Metallic ribbons shimmer with cyan reflections, adding to the sense of constant, flowing energy.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Comprehensive):**\n\"Highly detailed, dynamic abstract digital artwork. Striking interplay of luminous gold and deep blue-black, accented with vibrant cyan and white sparkles. A prominent, highly reflective blue-black sphere, swirling with gold patterns and emitting a star-like glow, sits slightly off-center. Intricate, flowing golden filigree and fractal tendrils, luminous like liquid gold or energetic plasma, dominate the composition. Broader, polished metallic ribbons, some pure gold, others dark with vivid cyan reflections, slice diagonally. Set against a deep, void-like background, punctuated by countless tiny, glittering white and multi-colored speckles. Intensely lit with emissive light, highly reflective polished metallic surfaces create a luxurious, futuristic, and cosmic aesthetic.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Concise & Punchy):**\n\"Dynamic abstract digital art: luminous gold and deep blue-black with cyan accents and white sparkles. Central, highly reflective blue-black sphere featuring swirling gold and a star-like glow. Intricate, flowing golden filigree and fractal tendrils, like liquid gold plasma. Diagonal, polished metallic ribbons (gold and dark with cyan reflections) cut through a deep, void-like background. Countless glittering speckles. Intensely lit, emissive, highly reflective, futuristic, cosmic, opulent.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise - ideal for models that interpret core concepts well):**\n\"Abstract digital art, dynamic, intricate. Luminous gold and deep blue-black, cyan highlights, white sparkles. Prominent, reflective blue-black sphere with gold swirls and star-like glow. Flowing golden filigree, fractal tendrils, liquid gold plasma. Diagonal polished metallic ribbons (gold, dark with cyan reflections). Deep void background with glittering cosmic speckles. Intensely lit, emissive, highly reflective, futuristic, opulent, cosmic.\"\n\n**Key considerations for the prompt:**\n\n*   **Remove Redundancy:** Phrases like \"resembling a celestial body or a cosmic scene contained within\" are descriptive but can be simplified to \"star-like glow\" or \"cosmic aesthetic.\"\n*   **Strong Adjectives:** \"Luminous,\" \"reflective,\" \"intricate,\" \"dynamic,\" \"emissive,\" \"futuristic,\" \"opulent.\"\n*   **Keyword Density:** Ensure key elements like \"gold,\" \"blue-black,\" \"sphere,\" \"filigree,\" \"ribbons,\" \"sparkles\" are present.\n*   **Implied Concepts:** \"Movement,\" \"energy,\" \"texture,\" and \"lighting\" are often conveyed through descriptive verbs and adjectives rather than explicit statements.\n*   **Watermark:** The watermark detail (\"AI\u751f\u6210\") is typically *not* included in a positive prompt, as you wouldn't want the model to generate it. If anything, it would be a negative prompt.\n\nI recommend **Option 2** for a good balance of detail and conciseness, providing enough information for the AI without being overly verbose.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Dynamic motion initiates the scene. Luminous, liquid-gold patterns actively flow, swirling, expanding, and converging like energetic plasma tendrils caught in a current. A dark, reflective sphere's surface continually shifts with swirling gold patterns and emanating light. Tiny, glittering particles incessantly drift and sparkle. Metallic ribbons shimmer with evolving cyan reflections, conveying constant, flowing energy."
