    "video_prompt": "Subtle swaying of tree branches, gentle rippling of water on the pond with lily pads bobbing slightly. The small white creatures blink occasionally and one on the treehouse platform subtly shifts its weight. Tiny yellow flowers on the grass and treehouse roof flutter slightly in a gentle breeze.",
    "image_prompt": "A charming, whimsical forest scene with a clear, vibrant pond in the foreground, featuring lily pads and small yellow flowers on water and around its edges. In the midground, a large, inviting treehouse with a green, grass-like roof adorned with small yellow flowers and a bright orange pumpkin sitting atop it. The treehouse has a light-colored wooden platform supported by a sturdy tree trunk, and features various window frames with warm light emanating from within. Three large, white, round, soft-looking creatures with small black eyes are visible; one is curled up on the treehouse platform, another is peering out from the treehouse doorway, and a third is on the grass to the left of the treehouse. In the background, lush, dense forest trees with varying shades of green foliage create a tranquil and natural atmosphere. The overall lighting is bright and cheerful, suggesting a sunny day. The art style is reminiscent of a cartoon or children's book illustration, with clean lines and a soft, inviting color palette. The composition is balanced and engaging.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Whispering foliage. Rippling reflections. Blinking curiosity. Shifting posture. Fluttering blossoms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Massive tree branches whip violently, threatening to uproot. The pond water erupts, sending lily pads flying, as a monstrous creature lunges from its depths. The white creatures shriek, rapidly scattering and transforming into aggressive, shadowy figures. The treehouse violently buckles and splinters as explosive tendrils of light burst from within. The pumpkin ignites with an infernal glow, and the yellow flowers writhe into thorny vines.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The forest floor begins to float upwards, trees invert their roots into the sky, and water from the pond cascades *into* the lily pads, coalescing into glowing orbs. The white creatures melt and reform into liquid, then vapor, then solid, their eyes spiraling like galaxies. The treehouse spins on its axis, its roof’s flowers blossoming with eyes as the pumpkin inflates and bursts into a swarm of colorful butterflies that phase through the environment.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide shot reveals a tranquil forest pond; a single white creature blinks, triggering a slow, dramatic zoom. The camera cranes up to reveal a cozy treehouse, its resident white forms subtly shifting. A sweeping pan shows the shimmering water, lily pads gently nudging one another. The wind picks up, rustling the green roof and causing tiny yellow flowers to dance. The camera then descends, framing a creature by the water, its gaze fixed on the gently rippling surface, a quiet moment of introspection.",
