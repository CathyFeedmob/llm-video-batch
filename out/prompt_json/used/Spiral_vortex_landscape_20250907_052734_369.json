    "video_prompt": "A subtle shimmer and sway in the DNA-like helix as light particles drift around it and within its glowing strands. The white dust on the ground softly billows and shifts with imperceptible currents, and small pebbles subtly vibrate on the surface of the sand and within the crater. The light above flickers gently.",
    "image_prompt": "A surreal full shot from an aerial perspective over a vast, ethereal, otherworldly desert landscape bathed in soft, bright diffused light, creating long shadows.\n\nIn the center, a large, perfectly circular, shallow impact crater is formed from a light, sand-colored material, resembling a volcanic caldera or moon crater. Within the crater's smooth, sloped inner walls, and spilling over its outer rim, are numerous small, irregularly shaped, light-colored pebbles or stones.\n\nFrom the crater's center, a massive, tightly wound spiral structure, constructed from the same pebble-like material, ascends vertically into the slightly hazy, bright sky. This spiral appears to be composed of segmented, chunky rings. Entwined around the spiral are thin, glowing blue and soft red lines or wires, some emitting bright, star-like light nodes that resemble energy or data flow. These lines emanate from the top of the spiral, suggesting a connection to something unseen above.\n\nBelow the crater, in the foreground, two small, silhouetted figures in dark suits stand on the flat, sandy ground, looking towards the crater and the ascending spiral. Their long, dark shadows stretch behind them. The overall scene conveys a minimalist, futuristic, and mysterious atmosphere, hinting at a blend of organic and technological elements. The color palette is dominated by whites, grays, and very light browns, with subtle touches of blue and red from the glowing lines. The ambient light suggests either a bright, overcast day or an alien sunrise/sunset. A subtle signature \"c29\" is visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The DNA-like helix subtly shimmers and sways, with continuous light particle movement around and within its glowing strands. White dust softly billows and shifts on the ground. Small pebbles vibrate subtly on the sand and within the crater. The overhead light flickers gently.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The massive DNA-like helix violently contracts then explodes upward, showering luminous particles while its glowing strands crackle with raw energy. Simultaneously, the white ground dust erupts into a violent whirlwind, swallowing the figures as pebbles launch into the air, hammering the crater walls which drastically heave and ripple like ocean waves. The light above strobes blindingly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A subtle shimmer and sway in the DNA-like helix as light particles drift around it and within its glowing strands. The white dust on the ground softly billows and shifts with imperceptible currents, and small pebbles subtly vibrate on the surface of the sand and within the crater. The light above flickers gently. The helix, defying gravity, begins to unravel upwards, its glowing strands morphing into liquid light that drips towards the sky. The crater on the ground inverts, becoming a shimmering mound as the sand and pebbles flow upwards, forming impossible crystalline structures that then dissolve into starlight. The figures on the ground begin to float, their shadows detaching and dancing autonomously before re-merging, all while the sky pulses with colors normally unseen.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic wide shot reveals a colossal DNA-like helix spiraling into a vast desert crater, its glowing strands pulsed with shimmering light and drifting particles. Two figures, dwarfed by the landscape, slowly approach the crater's edge. A low-angle shot from the crater's interior captures the helix's descent as it emits subtle tremors, causing sand to cascade down the crater walls. Rapid cuts showcase the figures casting long, converging shadows as the ground beneath them begins to subtly undulate, raising dust and briefly obscuring their forms.",
