    "video_prompt": "Subtle antenna swaying, tiny mechanical movements of legs, faint internal gear whirring, very slight camera zoom in and out.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed 3D render of a robotic shrimp, predominantly in vibrant red and metallic white, against a dark, minimalist background. The shrimp's body is segmented, showcasing intricate mechanical details, wires, and joints in silver and darker tones beneath the glossy red and white armor plating. It features multiple spindly legs with red and silver segments, delicate antennae, and a complex head with a single prominent black eye. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the reflective surfaces and creating strong contrasts and subtle gradients. The overall style is futuristic and sleek, with a focus on mechanical intricacy and polished aesthetics. A white logo \"c29\" with a registered trademark symbol appears in the bottom right corner, suggesting corporate branding or artist signature.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refinement:**\n\nSubtle antenna sway, tiny leg twitches, faint internal gear shifts, minor camera zoom in/out, and a gentle head tilt.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden mechanical shrimp lunges forward, claws snapping. Metallic legs rapidly scuttle, whipping antennae. Gears rapidly whir and grind, an explosive, high-pitched shriek. Zoom rapidly in and out, simulating a frantic, close-up chase.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity-defying shrimp levitates, its antenna dissolving into iridescent smoke threads that reweave into crystalline wings. Gears reverse-whir as its body phases through translucent states, revealing a nebula within. Legs ripple like liquid mercury before morphing into ethereal tentacles, pulling it through a collapsing vortex of time and space, leaving a trail of impossible, shifting colors.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pushes in, capturing the intricate dance of the shrimp's mechanical legs as they subtly flex and twitch, accompanied by the faint, sinister whirring of internal gears. A sweeping, slow-motion arc reveals the antenna, now snapping erratically, its tip briefly touching the dark, reflective surface below before recoiling. A sharp, almost imperceptible zoom in highlights the segmented tail, showcasing its sudden, powerful curl inward, then an elegant, slow unfurl, hinting at an imminent, unseen leap. \n\\\n\\",
