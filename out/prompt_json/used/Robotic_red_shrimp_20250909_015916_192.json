    "video_prompt": "The red antennae subtly twitch and sway. The small, segmented legs underneath the body exhibit a delicate, undulating motion. A faint, internal glow flickers from the exposed mechanical parts along the shrimp's back.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, realistic, and photorealistic rendering of a red and silver robotic shrimp, designed with a sleek, futuristic aesthetic. The shrimp is positioned dynamically on a light-colored, slightly textured surface, possibly a workbench or blueprint, with subtle technical diagrams or patterns visible.\n\n**Composition:** The robotic shrimp is the dominant subject, viewed from a slightly elevated, side angle, showcasing its full length and intricate details. It curves naturally, with its tail slightly curled to the right. The background is softly blurred, providing context without distraction, hinting at an industrial or workshop environment with abstract shapes and muted colors like dark grays and blues.\n\n**Subjects:** The robotic shrimp is fashioned from glossy red and metallic silver components, mimicking the segmented body of a real shrimp.\n    *   **Head/Carapace:** Features a mix of red plating and exposed silver mechanisms with intricate golden and bronze gears and wiring visible through openings. Two long, thin red antennae extend upward and backward from the head. A small, dark spherical \"eye\" or sensor is present on the head.\n    *   **Legs:** Multiple pairs of slender, jointed legs, primarily red with silver connections, extend from its underside, giving it a stable, grounded appearance.\n    *   **Body Segments:** The main body is composed of several large, smooth, interconnected red segments, each accented with silver banding or panels, giving a robust, armored look.\n    *   **Tail:** The tail flares out into distinct, fin-like red and silver plates, completing the shrimp's form.\n\n**Lighting:** Studio lighting with soft, even illumination highlighting the metallic sheen and glossy texture of the robot. There are subtle reflections on the red and silver surfaces, indicating light sources. A hint of dramatic backlighting might enhance the contours.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are vibrant red and cool metallic silver. Accents include gold/bronze for internal mechanisms, dark grey/black for shadows and background elements, and subtle blue from distant blurred background elements.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Sci-fi, clean, precise, and sophisticated. The image evokes a sense of advanced engineering and modern design.\n\n**Style:** Photorealistic rendering, 3D render, highly detailed, sharp focus on the robot, shallow depth of field, industrial design, mecha.\n\n**Additional details:**\n*   Small, subtle markings or text on the robot's surface, resembling model numbers or warning labels (e.g., \"S-08,\" \"C29\" visible near the bottom right of the image).\n*   The surface beneath the robot might have subtle imperfections or light scratches to enhance realism.\n*   The overall aesthetic is polished and high-tech, like a product render for a cutting-edge piece of robotics.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The red antennae subtly twitch and sway. The segmented legs undulate, propelling the mechanical shrimp forward. A faint, internal glow flickers and pulses along its back.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The robotic shrimp erupts, legs scrabbling wildly, flinging itself from the surface. Its antennae whip violently, seeking prey. Exposed mechanics glow intensely, whirring with explosive energy as the segmented body twists, contorts, and launches into a furious, unpredictable aerial maneuver, defying gravity with shocking agility.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The shrimp's robotic body warps, its metallic segments dissolving into a shimmering liquid. Red antennae unravel into spectral ribbons, defying gravity as they coil upwards, disappearing into an ethereal void. Legs morph into translucent wings, beating in a chaotic, reverse-motion rhythm, propelling the creature through a swirling dimension where light fragments into impossible hues.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow zoom-in on the mechanical shrimp reveals its vibrant red antennae subtly twitching. The camera then gracefully sweeps along its sleek, segmented body, highlighting the delicate, undulating motion of its numerous legs. As the camera pauses, focusing on an exposed mechanical section, a faint, internal glow flickers, casting an ethereal light on its metallic exoskeleton. The lighting shifts, intensifying the dramatic reveal of this intricate robotic marine life.",
