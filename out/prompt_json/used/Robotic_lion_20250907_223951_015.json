    "video_prompt": "A subtle, slow pan to the right, revealing more of the lion's body. The robotic eyes glow softly, dimming and brightening slightly. The individual segments of the mane subtly shift and articulate as if the lion is gently settling its weight. Tiny, almost imperceptible wisps of \"steam\" or \"energy\" rise from the exposed gears and tubing. The golden accents on its claws and joints shimmer with a faint, internal luminescence that pulsates slowly. A very subtle, low hum emanates, suggesting internal machinery.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image of a white robotic lion:\n\n**High-quality render of a majestic white robotic lion, in a dynamic, slightly crouching pose, mid-ground focus. The robot is crafted from pristine, smooth white panels, accented with intricate gold-toned and brushed metal mechanisms visible through gaps. Prominent internal workings, including wires (red and gold), pistons, and gears, are meticulously detailed. The eyes glow with a vibrant cyan blue light. The head features a stylized, layered mane with a metallic sheen, mimicking natural fur. Subtle details include a pink inner nose area, small black dots for whiskers, and soft white artificial fur for the beard. The paws are heavily armored with golden claws. The lighting is sharp and studio-like, casting subtle reflections on the glossy white surfaces, highlighting the metallic textures. The background is a minimalist, industrial setting with concrete walls and floor, slightly out of focus to emphasize the subject. The overall aesthetic is sleek, futuristic, and powerful.**",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rightward pan, revealing more lion. Robotic eyes softly glow and dim. Mane segments subtly shift, articulating weight. Nearly imperceptible energy wisps rise from gears/tubing. Golden accents pulsate with faint internal luminescence. Low hum suggests internal machinery.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "An intense, rapid pan to the right, followed by the robotic lion lurching forward, claws extended, its mane segments violently snapping into position. Blue energy blasts from its eyes as the internal machinery whirs loudly, glowing intensely. Golden accents on joints flare with blinding light. The ground cracks and dust explodes under its crushing weight, hinting at a powerful, impending pounce.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robotic lion's form flickers, its segments dissolving into liquid light that flows upwards, defying gravity. Gears spin backward, drawing energy tendrils into its core. Mane feathers morph into crystalline wings, vibrating with impossible frequencies. Golden accents emit pulsating rainbows, projecting ephemeral, shifting dimensions onto surfaces as the lion phase-shifts through reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, starting on the glowing eye, tracks left, panning slowly along the shimmering mane and articulated body. A subtle hum fades in, accompanied by faint steam from exposed gears. The golden claws glow with a gentle pulse as the mechanical lion shifts its weight, each segment of its sleek white armor flexing. The camera then smoothly arcs upward, revealing the full powerful form of the majestic, robotic beast, eyes blazing.",
