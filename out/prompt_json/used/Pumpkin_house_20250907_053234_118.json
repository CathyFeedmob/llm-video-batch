    "video_prompt": "Gentle flicker of light from the pumpkin house windows. Subtle rippling of the water in the stream, with the fishing line making tiny concentric circles. The fisherman's oar creates a slight splash. A soft rustle through the leaves of small plants and a slight sway of the pumpkin's stem.",
    "image_prompt": "A miniature fantasy food landscape, showcasing a large, vibrant orange pumpkin house with illuminated windows and a stone pathway leading to a front door. A small, winding river with bright teal water flows beside the house, with a tiny fisherman in a wooden boat casting a line, creating ripples. Surrounding the pumpkin house and river bank is a lush, textured ground covered in green moss, interspersed with various miniature vegetables like red tomatoes, purple and white onions, and green grapes. The overall scene has a warm, whimsical, and detailed aesthetic, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the foreground elements. Bright, natural lighting illuminates the scene. The image quality is high, with sharp details and rich colors.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Pumpkin house windows softly illuminate and dim. Stream water subtly ripples around concentric circles expanding from a bobbing fishing line. A gentle splash erupts where the fisherman's oar dips. Small plant leaves softly rustle, and the pumpkin's stem gently sways.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Suddenly, the pumpkin house violently *shakes*, its glowing windows *bursting* light outwards. The stream water *erupts* into a chaotic foam, *flinging* the fisherman's boat upwards as the fishing line snaps taut, *whipping* in the air. The oar *splinters* on impact. All plants *thrash* wildly, some *tearing* from the ground, as the pumpkin's stem *twists* and *contorts* like a screaming mouth, *swallowing* surrounding leaves.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The pumpkin house windows, now portals, suck light inward, then violently expel it as liquid gold, forming self-aware tendrils that dance with the reverse-flowing river. The fishing line transforms into ethereal smoke, drawing water upwards in spiral reverse-vortices. The fisherman's oar, now a feather, makes no splash but instead vibrates reality into shimmering hues. Leaves of the plants unfurl into crystal fractals, while the pumpkin's stem stretches and writhes like a living serpent, pulling the entire scene into an upward-cascading kaleidoscope.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Camera dramatically pulls back from the glowing pumpkin house, sweeping across the miniature landscape. The stream's ripples intensify, the fishing line's circles expanding as the fisherman, with a sudden jerk, pulls a shimmering fish from the water. His oar slices the surface, sending a cascade of droplets sparkling in an unseen light. Leaves quiver, revealing unseen creatures scurrying, as the pumpkin's stem vigorously sways as if breathing.",
