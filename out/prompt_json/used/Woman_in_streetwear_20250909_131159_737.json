    "video_prompt": "A slight shift in her weight, causing subtle ripples in her clothing near her thighs and midriff. Her eyes shift slightly, then blink slowly. The neon light below her subtly flickers and glows, casting a gentle, dynamic light on the graffiti below. A faint, almost imperceptible shimmer around the gold jewelry as if reflecting light.",

    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle weight shift creating clothing ripples. Eyes subtly shift, then a slow blink. Neon light below flickers dynamically, illuminating graffiti. Faint shimmer around gold jewelry reflects light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Suddenly, the graffiti explodes outwards, fragments spinning wildly, reforming into pulsing neon glyphs that lash at the air. Her eyes flash, emitting blinding white light that shatters the digital space. Her gold chains surge, coiling and snapping like furious serpents. The ground beneath her cracks, fiery fissures erupting to swallow the neon glow. She lunges forward, dissolving into a blinding streak of light, leaving only raw, burning energy in her wake.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses, rippling her clothing upwards as she slowly floats. Her gold jewelry shimmers into living snakes, coiling lazily. The neon light morphs into a spectral river, flowing *up* the graffiti-clad wall, which begins to breathe and pulse with impossible colors. Her eyes melt into swirling galaxies, then reform, blinking backwards. Time itself unravels, her every movement reversing and accelerating, until she phases into pure light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically swoops down, tracking her descent as she lands precisely on the ledge. A slow, artistic zoom on her eyes as they dart right, then left, before a deliberate, slow blink. The iridescent glow of the neon shifts, painting dramatic shadows across the graffiti as a gust of wind causes subtle shimmers on her gold jewelry, illuminating hidden tattoos.",
