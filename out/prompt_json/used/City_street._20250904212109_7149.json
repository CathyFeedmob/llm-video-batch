  "video_prompt": "Bustling city street at dusk. Pedestrians flow along sidewalks and cross streets in streams. Vehicles, including a prominent yellow taxi, traverse the street, their lights shifting. Building windows flicker and deepen in color as ambient light fades. Streetlights hum to life, casting expanding and contracting pools of warm light. Distant skyline subtly shifts as more lights appear.",
  "image_prompt": "Highly detailed, stylized, painterly illustration of a bustling city street at dusk. Strong one-point perspective down a canyon-like street lined with tall buildings. Features illuminated windows, storefronts, pedestrians, and cars with glowing headlights/taillights, including a yellow taxi. Tram tracks reflect warm light. The sky is a soft blue, contrasting with warm artificial lights. Diverse color palette with rich blues, warm oranges/yellows, and various building shades. Ornate domed buildings and distant modern skyscrapers add to the skyline. Captures vibrant street life and an evening atmosphere.",
