    "video_prompt": "Subtle atmospheric haze shifts around the planet-face. Individual light trails in the void gently pulse. The clouds on the lower left show minor, slow drift. The bright \"eye\" light flickers softly. Small particulate glows slowly emanate from the glowing point on the cheek.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A grand, cinematic vertical shot of a colossal human face merged with the Earth itself, viewed from space. The face, sculpted from continents and oceans, dominates the right half of the frame, with the nose and mouth facing left, peering towards the viewer. The 'skin' of the face is represented by the Earth's textured surface â€“ swirling white clouds form features like the brow and cheekbones, while darker blues and browns of land and sea define contours.\n\nParticularly emphasizing:\n*   The right eye: a bright, metallic, reflective sphere, reminiscent of a spacecraft or an advanced probe, embedded within the cloudy 'socket.'\n*   The left cheek: features a glowing, star-like burst of warm, orange light, suggesting an active, intense energy source or a distant city cluster. Tiny scattered lights across the 'dark side' of the face resembling city lights at night.\n*   The 'hairline' or upper part of the forehead: transitions into the dark, starry exosphere.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, the curve of the Earth's atmosphere is visible, transitioning from a soft, hazy blue near the planet to the deep, cosmic black of space. Streaks of brilliant, radiant blue light arc gracefully across the sky, like energetic cosmic rays or warp trails, creating a sense of dynamic movement and advanced technology. Several small, sleek, futuristic spacecraft are subtly visible in the distance on the left, trailing subtle blue light, enhancing the sci-fi atmosphere.\n\n**Composition:** Vertical, Rule of Thirds applied for the face's positioning, immense scale, slight Dutch tilt.\n**Style:** Hyperrealistic, Sci-Fi Epic, Cosmic Art, Surrealist.\n**Colors:** Predominantly cool blues, deep blacks, and whites, with accents of bright reflective silver/chrome, warm orange, and vibrant electric blue.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic side lighting from an unseen cosmic source, highlighting the contours of the 'face-Earth.' Glowing elements from within the planet (cities, eye, energy burst). Backlit atmospheric glow.\n**Atmosphere:** Awe-inspiring, mysterious, vast, technologically advanced yet natural. A feeling of cosmic consciousness or a living planet.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few refined options, focusing exclusively on dynamic elements:\n\n**Option 1 (Concise & Direct):**\n> Atmospheric haze subtly shifts around the planet. Light trails in the void gently pulse. Cloud formations on the lower left drift slowly. The \"eye\" light softly flickers. Particulate glows slowly emanate from the cheek.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Evocative):**\n> Whisps of atmospheric haze subtly undulate across the planet-face. Individual light trails in the void rhythmically pulse. Clouds in the lower left section exhibit a minor, languid drift. The bright \"eye\" light flickers with a soft, persistent energy. Minute particulate glows gradually bloom and ascend from the luminous point on the cheek.\n\n**Option 3 (Focus on Organic Movement):**\n> Observe the subtle undulation of atmospheric haze around the planet. Gentle, rhythmic pulsing of light trails in the void. A minor, slow drift of clouds on the lower left. The bright \"eye\" light softly, almost imperceptibly, flickers. Small particulate glows subtly emanate and dissipate from the glowing point on the cheek.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Planet-face convulses violently, facial features rapidly shifting and reforming. Blistering light trails lash out erratically across the void, exploding into blinding flashes. Clouds in the lower left churn into a furious, swirling vortex. The bright \"eye\" light flares intensely, then darkens completely. From the glowing cheek point, a torrent of superheated particulate jets outward, impacting the atmosphere with concussive force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The planetary face breathes, exhaling nebulous clouds that cascade upwards, forming sentient patterns. The glowing eye weeps streams of starlight that crystallize into constellations. Blue light trails, like celestial worms, slither out from the face, warping spacetime and folding distant galaxies into view. Meteors undulate as liquid light before dissolving into ethereal whispers. The entire cosmic vista undulates, breathing with a silent, impossible rhythm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A celestial entity, the planet-face, slowly comes into focus from a sweeping, wide shot of deep space. The camera glides closer, past ethereal light trails that pulse intermittently. A majestic camera arc reveals subtle atmospheric haze swirling around the giant features. Below, clouds drift languidly, emphasizing the entity's immense scale. A bright \"eye\" flickers, drawing the camera into a slow, dramatic dolly toward the glowing point on the cheek, from which particulate glows softly emanate, hinting at cosmic energy.",
