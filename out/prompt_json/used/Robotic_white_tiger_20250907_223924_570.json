    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image of a robotic panther:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A majestic, highly detailed, photorealistic robotic panther, sitting gracefully on a reflective, slightly damp concrete or metallic floor. The robot is primarily white and gold, with exposed internal wiring and mechanisms.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Body:** Sleek, futuristic white armored plating covers most of the robot's body, designed to mimic the smooth musculature of a panther. The plating has a high-gloss, reflective finish.\n*   **Exposed Mechanisms:** Significant portions of the robot's interior are visible, particularly along the spine, neck, and joints. These internal components are intricate, featuring numerous brass/gold metal gears, pistons, coils, and hydraulic pipes.\n*   **Wiring:** Bundles of various colored wires (red, blue, grey, black) are neatly routed through the exposed sections, adding to the mechanical complexity.\n*   **Head:** White armored head with soft, almost organic-looking fur details around the ears and chin (beard-like and whisker-like). The nose has a slight pink hue.\n*   **Eyes:** Piercing, luminous electric blue eyes that glow subtly, providing a focal point.\n*   **Paws/Claws:** Articulated robotic paws with white armored segments and sharp, shiny gold-tipped claws, giving a sense of power and precision.\n*   **Tail:** A multi-segmented, articulated tail, predominantly white with gold connections, culminating in a decorative gold finial.\n*   **Details:** Small, subtle markings or engravings are present on some of the white plating, resembling stylized floral patterns or technical symbols. Small LED-like lights glow light blue within some of the internal machinery.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:**\n*   **Angle:** Slightly low-angle shot, looking up at the panther, emphasizing its stature and power.\n*   **Framing:** Full body shot, with the panther occupying the majority of the frame, showing its entire form from head to tail and paws.\n*   **Pose:** The panther is in a noble, seated position, with its head turned slightly to the left, gazing intently forward. Its front paws are extended slightly.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Lighting:** Soft, diffused studio lighting, with subtle reflections and highlights on the glossy white and metallic surfaces. The light casts soft shadows, defining the robot's form without harsh contrasts.\n*   **Brightness:** Well-lit, bright image, making all details clearly visible.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Clean, futuristic, sophisticated, and slightly sterile, like a high-tech showroom or laboratory.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Pristine white and polished gold/brass.\n*   **Accent:** Luminous electric blue (eyes, internal lights), hints of red, blue, and grey in the wiring, subtle pink on the nose.\n*   **Background:** Muted, desaturated teal/grey solid wall, providing a clean, non-distracting backdrop that complements the robot's colors.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Realism:** Hyperrealistic, photorealistic, with extreme attention to material textures and mechanical detail.\n*   **Genre:** Sci-fi, Mecha, Robotic Art, Industrial Design.\n*   **Aesthetic:** Clean, sleek, sophisticated, and powerful.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The surface of the floor reflects the robot, indicating a wet or highly polished surface.\n*   Subtle depth of field, with the foreground and background slightly blurred to keep focus on the robot.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle eye glow pulsation, twitching whiskers, faint internal whirring and clicks, slight haptic feedback on claw tips, barely perceptible camera push-in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Robot panther lunges at viewer, jaws snapping. Metallic fur bristles, exposing sparking internal wiring as it scrapes claws across the floor, leaving deep gouges. Its glowing eyes flare, emitting concussive blasts that shatter the environment into flying debris. The tail whips like a scorpion, generating sonic booms. Its body distorts and expands, revealing hidden weaponry.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses for the robot and its reflection, pulling it skyward with impossibly elongating limbs, as internal wires writhe and sprout bioluminescent feathers, replacing claws with glittering cosmic dust that leaves star trails.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Begin with a slow, sweeping crane shot (low angle) revealing the majestic robot panther's form. A subtle, theatrical spotlight illuminates its glowing blue eyes. As robotic whirring intensifies, conduct a rapid, dramatic zoom into its twitching whiskers, then a quick whip pan to its internal mechanisms as hidden panels subtly open and close, revealing intricate gears. End with a cinematic, low-angle tracking shot as its gold-tipped claws subtly tap the reflective surface, leaving faint ripples.",
