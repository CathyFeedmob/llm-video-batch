Her metallic blue suit's reflective surfaces catch shifting light, creating a liquid effect, while red glowing lines on her suit, glasses, and dangling earrings pulsate. In the futuristic cityscape background, holographic billboards animate with abstract patterns.

  "image_prompt": "A highly stylized digital artwork depicting a formidable young woman in a futuristic, neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape. She has dark wavy hair, fair skin, and determined vibrant red eyes visible through bright red futuristic wraparound glasses. Her attire is a sleek, form-fitting metallic deep blue suit with a liquid-armor appearance, featuring a deep V-neck, a high stiff collar, sharp scale-like shoulder armor, a prominent glowing red diamond emblem on her chest, and intricate red glowing lines accentuating her physique. She wears a dark fedora with a red band and dangling red earrings. Posed confidently with a raised left hand, her gaze is direct and intense. The vibrant background features towering dark skyscrapers, glowing blue and red holographic billboards, pulsating red lightning-like energy streaks, and crystalline red glowing rock formations. The scene is dominated by cool blues and vibrant reds, illuminated by neon glow, creating a powerful, high-tech, and action-oriented atmosphere.",
