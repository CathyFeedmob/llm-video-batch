    "image_prompt": "A sprawling, cyberpunk city at night under a clear, dark sky, viewed from a low angle. Towering, dilapidated skyscrapers flank a street bustling with indistinct human figures viewed from behind, their silhouettes creating a sense of urban anonymity. The street itself is dark and wet, reflecting the neon glow of signs and building lights. The focal point is a colossal, menacing robotic monster with glowing red eyes, its clawed hand raised, appearing to either destroy or emerge from a building on the left. Its metallic body is dark and textured, casting a massive shadow over the city. A faint mist or smoke rises from the ground around the monster, adding to the dramatic tension. The overall lighting is desaturated and cool, dominated by shades of blue, gray, and black, punctuated by vibrant neon oranges and blues from the city lights. This creates a dark, gritty, and awe-inspiring atmosphere, evoking a sense of human insignificance against a monstrous, otherworldly threat. The composition guides the eye from the foreground figures up towards the gigantic monster, emphasizing its scale and dominance. This cinematic shot captures the essence of a sci-fi monster movie poster.\n\n**Style:** Cyberpunk, Cinematic, Sci-Fi, Dark Fantasy\n**Composition:** Low angle shot, Rule of thirds (monster as dominant element), Deep depth of field, Foreground figures leading the eye.\n**Colors:** Dominant cool tones (blues, grays, blacks), contrast with warm neon highlights (orange, blue).\n**Lighting:** Dramatic chiaroscuro, atmospheric, glowing elements (monster eyes, city lights), reflections on wet ground.\n**Atmosphere:** Menacing, awe-inspiring, dark, gritty, dystopian, tense.\n**Specific Visual Elements:** Colossal robotic monster with red glowing eyes and claws, futuristic cityscape, neo-noir lighting, indistinguishable human silhouettes, wet reflective surfaces, smoke/mist.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Dynamic Camera Pan: Violent upward lurch, debris raining down, the giant robot's *arm SMASHES* into a building, sparks *erupt*, smoke *billows* and *swirls* with furious intensity. The crowd *explodes* into panicked, scrambling movement, streetlights *flicker wildly*, neon signs *shatter* and *explode*, sending glass shards *flying* as the ground *trembles* and *cracks* underfoot.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A shimmering, liquid city skyline melts upward, dissolving into the giant robot's glowing, multifaceted form as it subtly pulls the moon and stars into its crimson eyes. The ground below ripples, then inverts, revealing an impossibly vast, cosmic abyss from which debris of crystalline light floats *up* into the heavens. The crowd moves in reverse, their bodies subtly twisting into ethereal smoke that drifts *into* buildings, transforming them into ancient trees bearing luminous fruit.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Crane shot reveals a towering, menacing robot, its red eyes glowing. The camera slowly pans upward, revealing debris falling from its metallic body, dramatically kicking up dust. Below, a diverse crowd reacts: some pointing skyward in awe, others panicking, a few defiantly continuing their walk. A sudden lightning flash illuminates the robot, its shadow engulfing the terrified city as the camera zooms into its glowing red eyes just before a cut to black.",
