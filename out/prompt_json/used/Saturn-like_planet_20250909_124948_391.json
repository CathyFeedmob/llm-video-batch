    "video_prompt": "Subtle swirling and diffusion of the blue smoke/gas; the Saturn-like rings slowly rotating; faint twinkling of distant stars; a very slow, subtle upward camera zoom; the small planets (moons) below the rings showing imperceptible orbital motion.",
    "image_prompt": "```\nHighly detailed space art rendering of a majestic ringed planet (like Saturn) partially obscured by ethereal, swirling blue and teal nebulous clouds and gas, set against a deep indigo and black starry sky. The rings are prominent, bright white and gray, and appear to have some liquid or gas flowing over and around them, creating a dynamic, almost wave-like effect. Below the planet, a vibrant Earth-like planet with a visible atmosphere and clouds occupies the lower third of the frame, with smaller moons or asteroids scattered in orbit. Bright starburst highlights are visible in the upper right, and a soft, bright glowing light emanates from the upper left, casting light across the scene. The composition is vertical, emphasizing the scale of the celestial bodies. The overall feel is mystical, grand, and serene, with a touch of surrealism due to the unusual blue gas interacting with the rings. A stylized, blue-to-teal gradient \"c29\" is subtly placed in the bottom right foreground.\n```",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle smoke swirling and diffusing. Rings slowly rotating. Distant stars faintly twinkling. Very slow, subtle upward camera zoom. Small planets imperceptibly orbiting.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Blue gas bursts, violently swirling through the rings as they judder and spin erratically. Distant stars flare and streak, while the camera violently whips through the cosmos. Moons below catapult upwards, then crash back down. Objects explode and vanish, reappearing in unexpected places with dynamic, supernatural force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The rings of Saturn begin to impossibly liquify, bleeding into the blue smoke which then condenses into ethereal humanoid figures. Distant stars spiral inward, becoming black holes that exhale vibrant nebulae. The planets below warp into shimmering portals, sucking in the rings and the sky, while the camera warps into a sentient, pulsating eye, its gaze unraveling reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow zoom outward reveals a colossal, ethereal Saturn-like ring system, its white bands subtly rotating as electric-blue nebula violently churns within its embrace. Distant stars glint into sharp focus as the camera sweeps down, revealing a gas giant below, its moons orbiting with an almost imperceptible, unsettling sway, hinting at the vast, silent dance of cosmic forces.",
