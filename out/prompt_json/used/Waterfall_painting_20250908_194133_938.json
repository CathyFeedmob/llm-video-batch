    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze rustles through the leaves of the trees within the painting, causing the waterfall to shimmer with subtle currents and splashes as it flows from the frame and pools on the floor, softly rippling the water. The distant clouds in the painting drift slowly across the sky. The flame within the desk lantern subtly flickers, casting dancing shadows on the books. The goldfish in the bowl leisurely swims around, its fins gently fanning.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A highly detailed and realistic, fantastical interior scene seamlessly blending a lavish library with a natural mountain landscape. The focal point is a massive, ornate golden framed painting on the left wall, depicting a majestic, verdant mountain valley with multiple tiers of sparkling turquoise waterfalls cascading into a serene river. The painting cleverly extends beyond its frame, with actual, realistic water flowing out of the bottom of the frame and onto the wooden floor, forming a small pool and ripples.\n\nThe library features dark, rich wooden paneling and built-in bookshelves densely packed with old books. On the right, a tall, narrow bookshelf corner is illuminated by a vintage, warm glowing wall lantern. Above the right shelf, a classic portrait hangs. On the left, a polished dark wooden side table holds a traditional, warmly lit table lamp with a cream shade, and a small decorative pot. Below it, open shelves display more stacked books.\n\nIn the foreground on the right, a round, highly polished dark wooden table supports a whimsical, clear glass globe containing vibrant orange and red goldfish swimming amidst glowing flora, casting a warm light. A ornate red and cream patterned rug partially covers the gleaming wooden floor where the waterfall collects. The overall atmosphere is magical, cozy, and sophisticated, with rich, deep colors, dramatic lighting highlighting the water and glowing elements, and an incredible sense of depth and fantasy.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Leaves sway. Waterfall ripples and splashes, expanding onto the floor and pooling. Clouds drift. Flame flickers, shadows dance. Goldfish swim, fins fanning.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The towering mountains in the painting violently rupture, releasing a torrent of water that explodes from the frame, crashing onto the floor. The surging cascade forms a wild, thrashing river that contorts the wooden floorboards. Lightning flashes through the painted sky, illuminating a chaotic storm that engulfs the room. The lantern's flame erupts into a roaring inferno, casting monstrous, flickering shadows. The goldfish bowl shatters, unleashing the fish which then transforms into a rapidly changing, shimmering entity, darting around the room with blinding speed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The waterfall recedes back into the frame, water molecules ascending into the painting, causing the clouds to coalesce and then dissolve into the mountains. Books on the shelves spontaneously close, their text vanishing. The goldfish, now a golden-scaled bird, flies from its bowl and perches on the desk lamp, its light pulsating with the bird's heartbeats.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom into the painting reveals the rustling tree leaves and the waterfall's shimmering, expanding currents cascading onto the floor. The camera pans from the pooling water to the floor, where the water ripples outwards. A subtle light change dims the room as the desk lantern's flame flickers erratically, casting exaggerated, dancing shadows across the books. Simultaneously, the goldfish swims with sudden, decisive movements, darting within its bowl.",
