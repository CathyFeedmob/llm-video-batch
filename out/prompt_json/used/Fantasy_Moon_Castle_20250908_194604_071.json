    "video_prompt": "A large, glowing orange full moon shimmers with subtle light variations. Clouds drift lazily across its face. The subtle breeze causes the tall spires on the cathedrals to gently sway while the crosses atop them flicker with a faint, internal light. The red cloak of the walking figure gently billows, and dust particles stir around their feet as they move forward. The overall ambient light of the scene subtly shifts, creating a dynamic atmospheric effect.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed fantasy art illustration depicting a solitary figure walking through a rocky canyon towards a majestic castle city under a giant, glowing orange moon.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** A lone figure from behind, dressed in a crimson red cloak with a hood covering their head and dark robes, holding a staff or thin sword-like object in their right hand. The figure walks on a sandy, rocky path.\n*   **Setting:** A narrow, imposing canyon with towering, rugged rock formations on either side, casting long shadows.\n*   **Architecture (Left):** A tall, slender castle tower or cathedral spire with intricate gothic details, visible further down the canyon on the left, partially obscured by the canyon walls.\n*   **Architecture (Right):** A massive, detailed gothic castle complex built into the right canyon wall, featuring multiple spires, turrets, arched windows, and possibly buttresses.\n*   **Background:** A grand, sprawling city of similar gothic architectural style, partially shrouded in mist or haze, receding into the distance at the end of the canyon.\n*   **Celestial Body:** A colossal, fiery orange moon dominates the sky, exhibiting a textured surface reminiscent of a molten or heavily cratered sphere. It appears immense due to perspective.\n*   **Foliage:** Sparse, dry-looking bushes or desert vegetation can be seen in the foreground and near the canyon walls.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Rule of Thirds/Leading Lines:** The figure is positioned to the left of center, and the canyon path acts as a strong leading line guiding the eye towards the distant city and the moon.\n*   **Depth:** Strong foreground elements (figure, rocks, bushes), midground (canyon walls, closer castle), and background (distant city, moon) create significant depth.\n*   **Symmetry/Asymmetry:** The canyon walls create a relatively symmetrical framing, but the castles are asymmetrical.\n*   **Focal Point:** The luminous moon draws immediate attention, but the figure and the path act as secondary focal points leading the viewer deeper into the scene.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Warm Palette:** Dominant colors are warm: vivid oranges and yellows from the moon and sky, deep reds of the cloak, and various shades of brown and ochre for the rocks and sand.\n*   **Contrast:** The bright, glowing moon strongly contrasts with the darker, cooler tones of the castle structures and the shadowy parts of the canyon.\n*   **Atmospheric Haze:** A soft, desaturated greenish-gray haze pervades the air, particularly in the background, creating a sense of distance and mystery.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Backlighting:** The primary light source is the intense glow of the large moon behind the castles, creating stark silhouettes and rim lighting for the distant structures.\n*   **Ethereal Glow:** The moon emits a powerful, almost otherworldly orange light that illuminates the sky and casts a subtle glow on the upper parts of the castles and canyon walls.\n*   **Shadows:** Long, deep shadows are cast by the canyon walls and the figure, indicating a low and intense light source.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mystical/Fantasy:** The giant moon and gothic castles evoke a strong sense of fantasy and wonder.\n*   **Epic/Grand:** The scale of the moon and the vastness of the canyon and city contribute to an epic atmosphere.\n*   **Solitary/Journey:** The lone figure suggests a journey or quest, adding a touch of solemnity and determination.\n*   **Eerie/Foreboding:** The orange glow, mist, and imposing structures can also hint at a slightly foreboding or mysterious mood.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Digital painting, highly detailed, realistic with fantastical elements. Hints of concept art or game art style.\n*   High dynamic range and intricate textures, especially on the moon and rock formations.\n\n**Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n\"An epic fantasy art illustration of a lone figure in a crimson red hooded cloak walking away from the viewer along a sandy, rocky path through a majestic canyon. Towering, rugged rock formations line both sides of the canyon. In the midground, a gothic castle complex with multiple spires and intricate details is built into the right canyon wall, while a tall, slender cathedral spire rises on the left. In the background, a sprawling cityscape of similar gothic architecture is shrouded in atmospheric haze. Dominating the sky is an enormous, fiery orange moon with a heavily textured, molten appearance, casting an intense, ethereal glow. The lighting is strong backlighting from the moon, creating deep shadows and striking silhouettes. The color palette is dominated by warm oranges, yellows, deep reds, and earthy browns, with a subtle greenish-gray haze in the distant air. Highly detailed, realistic with fantastical elements, concept art style, high dynamic range, intricate textures, volumetric lighting. --ar 9:16 --v 5.2\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Orange moon subtly pulsates. Wispy clouds drift. Cathedral spires imperceptibly sway; crosses flicker. Red cloak billows. Dust stirs around walking feet. Ambient light dynamically shifts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The gigantic, infernal moon throbs and pulsates, clouds violently erupting from its surface. Cathedral spires violently whip and crack, their crosses flaring with blinding, chaotic energy. The figure's red cloak billows into a raging typhoon of fabric, dust vortices exploding around their feet, propelled by unseen, monstrous forces. The entire world convulses, bathed in an apocalyptic, flickering light as the ground buckles and rocks.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A colossal, pulsating indigo moon dissolves into liquid mist, coalescing into crystal spires that pierce the sky. Cathedrals undulate like breathing organisms, their crosses spiraling into sentient tendrils. The figure's cloak phases between solid and light, their steps echoing through impossible geometries as gravity inverts, the path ahead unfurling like a dimensional rift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms in on the colossal, glowing orange moon, clouds subtly swirling across its surface. A low, sweeping shot follows the figure in the billowing red cloak as they walk through the canyon, dust rising with each step. Suddenly, a cathedral spire, momentarily catching the moon's light, illuminates the faint flickering crosses. The camera then tracks from above, revealing new hidden cathedrals in the misty distance, their spires slowly swaying in the unseen wind, as the figure resolutely continues their journey forward.",
