    "video_prompt": "Subtle dust motes drift across the Martian landscape. The large spacecraft gently shimmers with faint heat haze. The headlights of the rover softly pulsate. The smaller flying craft in the distance exhibits a very slight, almost imperceptible, rocking motion. The astronaut's suit very subtly reflects a shift in ambient light.",
    "image_prompt": "A vivid, comic-book style illustration of a futuristic Mars exploration scene. In the foreground, an astronaut in a white suit with a black helmet visor sits in a rugged, beige and orange multi-wheeled rover with bright, circular headlights, facing slightly left. The rover is positioned on the reddish-orange Martian terrain with scattered rocks and subtle texture.\n\nBehind the rover, a tall, white and orange rocket with four large supporting boosters stands upright, landed on the Martian surface with visible landing gear and access ramps. In the mid-ground, another astronaut in a white suit walks towards the rocket from the right. To the left, a sleek, gray and blue futuristic spacecraft hovers in the Martian sky.\n\nThe prominent background features the massive, reddish-orange globe of Mars filling a large portion of the upper left sky, showing distinct dark craters and geological features. The rest of the sky is a deep black, dotted with faint white stars and a subtle nebula. The overall color palette is dominated by reds, oranges, and blacks, with accents of white, blue, and yellow. The lighting is strong, casting visible shadows and highlighting the details of the vehicles and figures. The atmosphere evokes a sense of sci-fi adventure and exploration. Signed \"C29\" in the bottom right corner.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Martian dust whips into a sudden, aggressive storm. The massive spacecraft dramatically lurches and lifts off with a violent, concussive blast. The rover's headlights explode outward, shards of light piercing the atmosphere. The flying craft in the distance rapidly descends and crashes, erupting into a fiery inferno. The astronaut's suit violently tears, revealing an unknown, pulsating energy within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses, sending dust motes spiraling *upwards* into the Martian sky, coalescing into glowing orbs. The spacecraft *implodes* into a shimmering nebula, then *reconstructs itself* as hundreds of butterflies. Rover headlights *stretch and swirl* like molten gold, then *solidify* into crystalline eyes. The distant craft *shrinks into a pinprick of light*, then *expands* into a blossoming supernova. The astronaut's suit *melds* with the ground, then *ripples* into liquid chrome, reflecting *impossible geographies*.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Dramatic Mars Exploration**\n\n**Camera:** A slow, dramatic dollying shot tracks the astronaut in the rover across the rugged Martian terrain. Suddenly, the camera zooms in rapidly on the astronaut's visor as a distant glint catches their eye. The camera then *swoops* up and over the landing site, revealing the colossal spacecraft, its illuminated core pulsing. Dust billows dramatically from the rover's wheels as it swerves towards an unexplored crevice. A sudden, intense flare from the distant sun highlights the intricate details of the spacecraft, casting long, dynamic shadows. The rover's headlights intensely illuminate a newly discovered anomaly nearby.",
