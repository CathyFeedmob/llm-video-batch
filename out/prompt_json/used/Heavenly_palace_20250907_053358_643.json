The scene is dominated by towering, ornate white and gold marble pillars and archways, reminiscent of classical Roman-inspired architecture. Lush, voluminous clusters of light pink, blue, and white flowers and foliage cascade down the structures, mingling with delicate golden vines.\n\nThe sky above is a brilliant, clear azure, dotted with shimmering stars and soft, fluffy white clouds, with a hint of warm sunset hues peeking through in the distance. Several graceful, white winged figures, resembling angels or mythical beings, are subtly depicted mid-flight, enhancing the angelic atmosphere.\n\nA grand white staircase adorned with flowering railings ascends towards the viewer from the bottom center, leading into the heart of this celestial city. The lighting is bright and warm, creating a sense of bliss and magic, with soft glows emanating from certain areas, highlighting the opulent details. The overall composition is symmetrical and grand, invoking feelings of peace, wonder, and sacred beauty. A whimsical, dreamlike ambiance permeates the entire image.",

Pillars gently stretch, then compress, their forms bleeding into the sky, while time oscillates, causing blooming flowers to rewind and then explode into liquid light. surfaces ripple like water, reflecting a kaleidoscopic, impossible geometry.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Begin with a slow, sweeping crane shot revealing the grand archways, the camera subtly swaying with the drifting petals. As the shot descends towards the stairs, a gentle zoom-in captures the faint shimmer on the pillars, while the gently swirling clouds cast dancing shadows.
