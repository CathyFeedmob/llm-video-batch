    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down into categories for clarity:\n\n**Core Prompt:** A digital ink wash painting of a young woman with light brown, chin-length hair styled in two small pigtails with black bows and red accents, wearing a grey and black plugsuit with green accents, standing in a confident pose with one hand on her hip.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Character:** Young woman, anime style, with a calm, slightly smiling expression. Her eyes are light blue with large pupils and subtle sparkle. Delicate facial features.\n*   **Hair:** Light brown, slightly messy, short bob-length hair, two small pigtails at the top of her head tied with black ribbon bows, with subtle red floral accents within the bows. Loose strands frame her face and neck.\n*   **Attire:** Form-fitting grey and black plugsuit with intricate paneling and glowing green accents on the chest, collar, and rectangular segments. Dark grey/black gloves and boots integrated into the suit. Some reddish-orange details on the forearms.\n*   **Pose:** Standing, slightly turned towards the right, left arm bent with hand resting on her hip. Right arm extended down. Confident, poised stance.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Medium:** Digital ink wash painting (Sumi-e inspired).\n*   **Brushwork:** Visible, gestural, dynamic brush strokes, particularly evident in the hair, suit details, and shadows. A sense of spontaneity and handcrafted feel.\n*   **Highlights:** Subtle white highlights on the eyes and a faint sheen on the plugsuit, suggesting a smooth, semi-reflective material.\n*   **Line Art:** Strong, confident black lines defining contours and internal details, varying in thickness.\n*   **Shading:** Achieved through varying densities of grey ink and black brushstrokes, creating depth and form. Minimal use of hard shadows.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Framing:** Half-body shot, ample negative space around the character.\n*   **Perspective:** Eye-level, direct gaze.\n*   **Balance:** Well-balanced, with the character centrally placed but slightly off-center to the left, creating a natural flow.\n*   **Background:** Plain white or very light off-white, allowing the character and art style to be the sole focus. Minimal, subtle texture on the paper-like background.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Greys (light, medium, dark), black, brown (hair).\n*   **Accents:** Bright green, subtle red/orange, light blue (eyes).\n*   **Palette:** Limited and muted, characteristic of ink wash, with pops of color for contrast.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Direction:** Soft, ambient light, seemingly from the front and slightly to the left, creating gentle shading.\n*   **Effect:** Illuminates the character evenly, highlighting textures and forms without harsh shadows.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Calm, confident, powerful, determined.\n*   **Overall Impression:** Elegant, artistic, and evocative, blending traditional ink techniques with modern anime aesthetics.\n\n**Artist/Inspiration (Optional, if specific style is desired):** Inspired by Sumi-e art, anime character design, Ink wash paintings, Evangelion series aesthetics.\n\n**Negative Prompts (to avoid unwanted elements):** No complex background, no blurry lines, no vibrant colors, no photorealism, no 3D rendering, no bad anatomy, no extra limbs, no text or watermarks in foreground.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle hair and ribbon sway, gentle breath animation, blinking eyes, slight head tilt, delicate hand gesture, plugsuit's green elements subtly shimmer, soft camera pan up.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "\"Hair and ribbons explode outwards, eyes snap open and burn, head violently jerks, a fist clenches, the plugsuit's green elements erupt with pulsating energy, and a rapid, disorienting zoom crashes in.\"",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Ribbons unfurl, becoming spectral wisps that pull the hair upwards defying gravity, revealing eyes that ripple into cosmic nebulae, blinking into existence new stars. The head imperceptibly rotates 360 degrees, the hand transmutes into a swarm of luminous butterflies, its green plugsuit elements bleed rainbow light that phases through the canvas, distorting the scene into an endless, self-consuming spiral as the camera inverts reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in on the character's face. Her eyes, filled with determination, slowly shift gaze. The subtle sway of her hair and ribbons intensifies as a gust of wind sweeps across her, causing her to subtly tilt her head, revealing a delicate hand gesture. The camera slowly pans up her plugsuit, each green element shimmering with an inner glow. A final, quick zoom pushes into her eyes, where a final, solitary tear rolls down, a silent statement.",
