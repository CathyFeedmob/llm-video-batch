    "video_prompt": "A subtle iridescent shimmer across the wings, mimicking faint dust motes catching light. The antennae slightly twitch. The small lights on its body subtly flicker, revealing depth and highlighting the intricate metallic textures. A gentle, almost imperceptible pulsation of the abdomen. The surrounding golden light trails slowly undulate and expand outwards. A very slight, slow zoom-out camera movement, revealing more of the dark, ambient background.",
    "image_prompt": "A full-body shot of a realistic robotic bee, designed with a sleek, futuristic aesthetic, against a dark, out-of-focus background with subtle light trails. The bee's body is primarily a vibrant, metallic green, with articulated segments and a segmented abdomen featuring sections of a matte gold or brass color. The eyes are large and black, with a subtle textured surface. Delicate, transparent wings with intricate golden veins extend from its back. Its legs are slender, segmented, and metallic green with darker metallic joints and feet, appearing poised as if in flight. The lighting accentuates the metallic sheen of the robot's body, creating clear highlights and reflections. The overall composition is dynamic, with the bee positioned slightly to the left, looking forward, and the light trails curving around the lower left edge, adding to the movement and technological feel. A prominent yellow and black \"c29\" logo is positioned in the bottom right corner. The style is highly detailed and photorealistic, bordering on a highly rendered 3D sculpture.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Iridescent shimmer subtly ripples across wings, antennae twitching. Body lights softly flicker, highlighting metallic textures. Abdomen gently pulsates. Golden light trails undulate and expand. Extremely slow, subtle camera zoom out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The robotic wasp, with a sudden, violent jolt, thrashes its head, antennae whipping wildly. Its metallic wings explosively beat, tearing through the air, propelling it in erratic, lightning-fast bursts. Lights on its body strobe erratically, illuminating its form as the gleaming, segmented abdomen rapidly contracts and expands, seeming to coil before launching. The golden light trails outside convulse, forming chaotic, intertwining spirals around the rapidly maneuvering creature. The camera violently zooms in and out, contributing to the feeling of pandemonium.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cyber-insect's iridescent wings ripple with impossible light, drawing in the surrounding golden trails which then reform into ethereal tendrils, pulling the creature backward through hyperspace until it dissolves into starlight, reforming as liquid chrome before stretching into a swirling vortex that consumes the darkness itself.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, deliberate zoom-in reveals the robotic bee, its iridescent wings subtly shimmering as the antennae twitch. A soft golden light emerges from the left, tracing a gentle arc as the bee's abdomen pulsates. The camera then tracks with the bee as it slowly drifts into the darkness, its body lights flickering in the encroaching gloom, hinting at a hidden menace.",
