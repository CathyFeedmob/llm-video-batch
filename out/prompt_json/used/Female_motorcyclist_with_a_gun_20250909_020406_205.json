    "video_prompt": "Long blonde hair gently sways in the night breeze. Her chest subtly rises and falls with each breath. The large moon behind her pulsates with a soft glow. Reflections on the wet asphalt shimmer and ripple slightly. Distant city lights twinkle; passing cars cast faint, transient gleams on the street. Her eyes softly blink, and her grip on the gun ever so slightly tightens then relaxes. A subtle camera zoom out reveals more of the city street.",

    "refined_video_prompt": "Long blonde hair sways. Her chest rises and falls gently. The moon behind her pulsates. Wet asphalt shimmers and ripples. City lights twinkle; passing cars cast transient gleams. Her eyes blink, her grip on the gun tightens then relaxes. The camera subtly zooms out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Moon rapidly expands, casting sharp, shifting shadows. Buildings warp and stretch, their lights flaring and dimming erratically. Wet asphalt cracks, water geysers upward, defying gravity. Cars streak past in blurs, leaving fiery trails. The woman's hair whips violently, gun muzzle flashes with explosive force, and her eyes blaze, pupils dilating erratically. The entire scene pulsates with raw, unleashed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Moon fragments splinter inward, forming a swirling portal. Her hair entwines with the cityscape, buildings bending and stretching. The motorcycle transforms, its wheels becoming rippling water that absorbs reflections of passing cars, now levitating upside down in the sky. The gun melts into a constellation while her eyes become tiny moons, blinking in rhythmic discord. The asphalt below becomes a mirrored void, cars phasing through its impossibly deep surface.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Begin with a steady, low-angle shot, gliding slowly towards the front wheel. As we approach, a quick tilt up reveals the sleek bike and the woman, Catwoman-like, in a powerful stance. A sudden, sharp zoom-in on her eyes, glinting with determination, then a rapid pull-back as she raises the gun, aiming. The camera sweeps dramatically around her, showcasing the vast, luminous moon. As city lights pulse, a slow, deliberate zoom out captures the full urban spectacle, cars gliding by. Finally, a wide, establishing shot of the enigmatic figure under the immense moon, a lone silhouette amidst the city's glow.",
