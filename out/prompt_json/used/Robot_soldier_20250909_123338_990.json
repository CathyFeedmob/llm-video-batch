    "video_prompt": "A very subtle rise and fall of her chest, indicating breathing. Her eyes subtly blink once. The small strands of hair near her face gently sway with an unseen breeze. The rusted metal on her armor shows very subtle glints of light reflecting off the uneven surface. A faint, almost imperceptible dust or particle effect drifts across the dark background. The trigger finger on her right hand minutely twitches.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull-body shot of a young, determined female character in a post-apocalyptic, sci-fi setting, wearing heavily rusted and worn light blue-grey metal armor plates adorned over olive-drab tactical clothing. She has short, light brown hair and a calm expression. Her right arm is extended, holding a heavily detailed, bulky, and rustic sci-fi rifle with exposed mechanisms and a visible barrel. Her left arm hangs slightly to the side, ending in a mechanized hand.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n*   **Character:** Young female, determined but calm expression, short light brown hair, fair skin.\n*   **Armor:** Predominantly light blue-grey metal, heavily rusted with reddish-brown patches and streaks. The armor includes shoulder pads, forearm gauntlets, a large chest plate, and waist/hip plating. It appears bolted and riveted together.\n*   **Clothing:** Olive-drab tactical fatigues underneath the armor, including a form-fitting dark torso layer and cargo pants with straps on the thighs. Brown leather pouches are strapped to her belt.\n*   **Helmet:** Worn, light green-grey metal helmet with prominent mechanical ear attachments and a slightly rusted texture.\n*   **Weapon:** Large, intricate sci-fi assault rifle held in her right hand. It features multiple barrels, exposed wires/hoses, metallic textures with corrosion, and a robust, industrial design.\n*   **Left Hand:** Her left hand appears to be a segmented, metallic, and somewhat industrial-looking prosthetic or gauntlet.\n\n**Style:**\n\n*   **Art Style:** Detailed illustration with influences of anime/manga for the character's face, combined with realistic rendering of textures (rust, metal, fabric).\n*   **Aesthetic:** Gritty, post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, dieselpunk/steampunk elements (exposed machinery, rivets, rust).\n*   **Line Art:** Clean, defined lines with watercolor-like blending and subtle rough edges in areas, especially on fabric and rust.\n\n**Composition:**\n\n*   **Posing:** Standing upright, facing slightly to her right, with her gaze directed forward. Her right arm is raised holding the rifle across her body.\n*   **Framing:** Mid-shot, showing most of her body from roughly the knees up, with ample negative space.\n*   **Background:** Solid black behind the character, transitioning to a white/light grey ground plane or void beneath her, creating a stark contrast.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   **Dominant Tones:** Muted and earthy. Light blue-grey and reddish-brown (rust) for armor, olive-drab green for clothing, dark grey/black for under-suit and background.\n*   **Highlights:** Subtle light reflections on metal surfaces.\n*   **Palette:** Limited and desaturated, emphasizing the gritty, industrial feel.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n*   **Directional:** Appears to be illuminated from the upper left, casting subtle shadows and highlighting contours on the armor and face.\n*   **Effect:** Highlights the texture and wear on the materials, emphasizing the rusted components.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Mood:** Serious, somber, resilient.\n*   **Implied Narrative:** Suggests a harsh, survival-focused world.\n\n**Optional Details/Text (if generation platform supports text input):**\n\n*   Top left corner: \"AI 生成\" (AI Generation), \"FFMACC1944\"\n*   Bottom right corner: \"c29\" in a brushstroke font.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Her chest subtly rises and falls. Eyes blink once. Face-framing hair gently sways. Light glints minutely off her rusted armor. Faint dust drifts across the background. Her trigger finger twitches.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her helmet bursts open, revealing glowing, ancient symbols pulsating on her scalp. The rusted armor violently sheds its brittle plates, forming razor-sharp wings that erupt from her back. Her eyes ignite with searing energy as the gun morphs into a snarling, metallic beast, its barrels extending into writhing tentacles. Explosions ripple across the dark background, conjuring phantom landscapes that twist and collapse. Her entire body contorts, limbs extending and retracting with impossible speed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her chest ripples, distorting into a swirling nebula. Eyes morph into cosmic voids, releasing stars that rewind into her skull. Hair becomes liquid light, forming impossible Möbius strips that pulsate. The rusted armor sheds cascading streams of rust that float upwards, transforming into shimmering butterflies. The dark background unravels into a tapestry of impossible geometries, while her trigger finger elongates, becoming a serpentine limb that weaves through non-Euclidean space.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, cinematic zoom-in on her determined eyes. A subtle shift in lighting, casting faint shadows across her face. Her hand, gripping the rusted weapon, clenches slightly. The camera subtly pans around her, revealing the intricate, worn details of her armor. A single, shimmering light source briefly glints off the rusted metal as it passes. The wind picks up, making her hair and the dust around her swirl with renewed intensity.",
