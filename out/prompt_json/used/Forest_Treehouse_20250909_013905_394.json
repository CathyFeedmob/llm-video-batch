    "video_prompt": "Water ripples subtly around the tree trunks and lily pads. The small, white characters inside the treehouse gently shift, as if breathing. A soft, warm glow emanates from the windows, subtly pulsating. The leaves and grass on the treehouse roof, and the surrounding trees, gently sway. The pumpkin on the roof subtly vibrates.",
    "image_prompt": "A charming illustration of a green mushroom-shaped treehouse nestled in a vibrant, lush, and slightly flooded forest. The scene is depicted in a whimsical, storybook-like art style with clean lines and a soft, painterly texture akin to gouache or digital painting.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Treehouse:** A prominent, spherical treehouse with a vibrant green, textured \"grass\" roof adorned with small yellow flowers and a large orange pumpkin. The exterior matches the vibrant green of the surrounding foliage.\n*   **Interior:** The interior of the treehouse is visible through a large, arched opening. It features warm wooden floors, soft green walls, and small arched windows. Inside, there are five small, white, marshmallow-like creatures, some with slight variations like green hats or blue accents. Potted plants are on a side table and by a window.\n*   **Trees:** Abundant green trees of varying shapes and shades of green (pine and deciduous, some appearing like large bushes) surround the treehouse, creating a dense forest backdrop.\n*   **Water:** The lower portion of the image shows a body of still, calm, light blue-green water, reflecting some of the tree trunks. Water lilies and floating yellow flowers dot the surface, with some tall green reeds emerging from the water.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Vertical orientation.\n*   The treehouse is centrally positioned, drawing the eye.\n*   The forest extends from the top to the bottom, with the water at the base.\n*   Foreground elements (water lilies, flowers) lead into the midground (treehouse, tree trunks) and background (dense forest canopy).\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Dominant greens (various shades for foliage, treehouse, plants).\n*   Light blue-green for the water.\n*   Warm accents: Orange (pumpkin), yellow (flowers), brown (tree trunks, wood floor), light yellow/gold (window light, interior walls).\n*   Soft white for the marshmallow creatures.\n*   Overall a bright and playful color palette.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Soft, diffused lighting, suggesting a gentle daytime.\n*   A slight glow emanates from the treehouse interior, indicating warmth and coziness.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Whimsical, inviting, peaceful, and cozy.\n*   A sense of nature and fantasy.\n\n**Artist Style Keywords:**\nChildren's book illustration, whimsical art, fantasy illustration, cute characters, magical forest, storybook art, digital painting, gouache style, bright and vibrant colors, soft textures.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Water gently ripples around the tree trunks and lily pads. The small, white characters inside the treehouse subtly undulate. A soft, warm glow from the windows subtly pulses. Leaves and grass on the treehouse roof and surrounding trees gently sway. The pumpkin on the roof subtly vibrates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The water violently churns, geysers erupting around the thrashing tree trunks and lily pads! The white characters inside the treehouse launch into a frenetic dance, their forms contorting and splitting! Explosions of green light burst from the windows, tearing through the air! The treehouse roof's foliage and surrounding trees wildly whip and distort, branches snapping! The pumpkin on the roof bursts into flames, a fiery vortex consuming it!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The pumpkin on the roof melts into a shimmering pool, reforming as a flock of golden butterflies that flutter into the inverted sky. The treehouse slowly compresses into a tiny, pulsating orb, then expands into a swirling nebula of light. Inside, the characters stretch and ripple, their forms intertwining with the merging furniture, as the entire scene gently breathes in and out, becoming a distorted reflection of itself within the water. Trees morph into spectral ribbons, looping through the shifting dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, sweeping camera pans across the tranquil flooded forest, revealing subtle ripples around the tree trunks and lily pads. The camera gently pushes in on the whimsical green treehouse. Inside, a soft, warm glow from the windows subtly pulses, as if the house itself is breathing. Rapidly zoom into the interior: the small, white characters gently shift, their eyes briefly twinkling. A cinematic tilt-shift effect emphasizes the pumpkin on the roof, which subtly but perceptibly vibrates, hinting at a hidden energy. The leaves and grass on the treehouse roof, and the surrounding trees, gently sway, adding to the ethereal mood.",
