    "video_prompt": "Fabric subtly ripples and sways around the figure, hinting at a gentle breeze. The light source, illuminating the figure from behind, flickers softly. Dust motes drift in the air, catching the light. The figure's eyes subtly blink.",
    "image_prompt": "Full-body vertical shot of a female character, possibly an assassin or scavenger, standing on outdoor train tracks. She is wearing a hooded, light-colored (beige/grey) ragged fabric cowl that covers her head and face, with only her dark brown eyes visible. Multiple layers of loose, flowing, and distressed fabric make up her attire and scarf. Detailed dark brown leather straps, belts, and pouches are worn over her clothing, including a prominent over-the-shoulder bandolier. A distinctive, layered, dark, metallic or leather shoulder armor piece is worn on her right shoulder. She also has elaborate wrist and hand wraps/gloves made of similar dark, weathered material. The background features blurred industrial structures, possibly train cars or machinery, under a bright, overcast sky. The lighting suggests late afternoon or early morning, with soft, directional light casting subtle shadows and highlighting the edges of her clothing. The overall atmosphere is gritty, post-apocalyptic, and mysterious. The composition is centered, drawing attention to the character's detailed outfit.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movement & Changes:**\n\n* Fabric subtly ripples and sways around the figure, hinting at a gentle breeze.\n* The light source flickers softly behind the figure.\n* Dust motes drift and sparkle in the air.\n* The figure's eyes subtly blink.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Fabric shreds rip violently, scattering in a sudden Gale. The figure lunges forward, a blur of motion, as sharp, metallic shards burst from the shoulders. The ground cracks and heaves underfoot, sending geysers of dust skyward. Fiery energy erupts from within, casting flickering, aggressive shadows that dance erratically, threatening to consume the frame.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fabric, woven from pure light, pulses and breathes with an inner luminescence, its ripples echoing impossible waveforms. The light source, a vortex of swirling nebulae, draws the figure in, stretching and compressing their form like liquid glass. Dust motes, constellations of micro-galaxies, orbit the figure, occasionally reforming into shimmering, ephemeral hands that caress their face. The figure's eyes, portals to shimmering infinities, cyclically expand and contract, revealing glimpses of cosmic ballet within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, cinematic push-in on the figure, their eyes subtly blinking, as subtle ripples and swaying fabric hint at a gentle breeze catching the light from behind. A delicate dust motes drift in the air. The camera then slightly shifts to reveal the industrial structures in the background, drawing focus to their rugged attire and the dramatic backlighting. A dramatic pull-back then reveals more of the setting, emphasizing their lone presence.",
