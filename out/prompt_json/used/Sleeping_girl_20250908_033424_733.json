    "video_prompt": "Here's a video generation prompt focusing on natural, subtle movements:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nSubtle rise and fall of her chest simulating breathing. Hair gently sways as if a breeze passes through an open window. Pink light of the magic circle slowly pulses and flickers. Blue spirit flames around her feet subtly undulate and flow. The curtains in the background softly drift inwards and outwards.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA young, slender girl with long, straight black hair, wearing a pink kimono adorned with small white cat faces and a prominent dark blue obi (sash) tied in a large bow at the back. She is lying on her stomach, facing right, with her head resting on her arms, implying sleep or relaxation. Her bare legs are raised vertically, with feet visible at the top of the frame. Floating around her legs and near her left hand are several glowing, swirling blue energy orbs with intricate patterns and radiating mist, suggestive of magic or a dream state. A large, complex glowing pink magic circle with a pointed central element is on the tatami mat floor, near her head.\n\n**Style:**\nAnime art style, clean lines, vibrant colors, slightly exaggerated proportions (especially the legs). Soft shading with some highlights, giving a smooth and appealing look.\n\n**Composition:**\nVertical shot, full body of the girl centrally placed, viewed from a slightly elevated angle looking down. The raised legs create a leading line upwards, while the main body grounds the composition horizontally. The magic elements are strategically placed to add visual interest and balance.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are soft pink (kimono), black (hair, part of obi), dark blue (obi), and bright, glowing blue and pink (magic effects). The background features natural wood tones (shoji frames) and light green/beige (tatami mats). White is used for the cat faces and parts of the background light.\n\n**Lighting:**\nSoft, natural lighting coming from the right, illuminating the scene and casting subtle shadows. There are strong highlights on the girl's hair and skin, and the magic effects emit their own light, illuminating nearby areas. The overall impression is bright and airy.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nDreamy, peaceful, magical, enchanting. A sense of tranquility combined with subtle fantastical elements.\n\n**Concise Prompt:**\nAnime style full body shot illustration of a slender young girl with long black hair, wearing a pink kimono with white cat patterns and a dark blue obi bow, sleeping on her stomach on a tatami mat. Her bare legs are raised vertically upwards. Glowing blue mystical energy orbs float around her legs and near her hand. A large, intricate glowing pink magic circle is on the tatami mat near her head. Soft sunlight from the right illuminating a traditional Japanese room with sliding shoji screens. Dreamy atmosphere, vibrant colors, clean lines, high detail.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Prompt:**\n\nHer chest rhythmically rises and falls. Her hair gently sways. The pink light of the magic circle subtly pulses and flickers. Blue spirit flames around her feet undulate and flow. The curtains in the background softly drift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Prompt:**\n\nHer body jolts upright, hair violently whips around her as the magic circle erupts with a blinding pink flash. Blue spirit flames surge, engulfing objects in a fiery dance. The room violently shakes as curtains thrash and rip, revealing glowing eyes from the darkness beyond. Tatami mats ripple like crashing waves.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "**Prompt:**\n\nThe girl's legs slowly twist upwards, transforming into luminous blue serpents that writhe and merge with the spirit flames. Her pink kimono ripples inward, revealing an intricate cosmic pattern that expands and contracts. The magic circle on the floor spirals backward, pulling fragmented light from the universe into its core. Curtains warp and stretch, becoming translucent portals showing impossible landscapes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic Video Prompt:**\n\nA dramatic slow zoom reveals a peaceful sleeper. Suddenly, a forceful updraft from the active magic circle lifts her hair and the curtains dramatically inward, catching them in a swirling vortex of shimmering blue spirit flames that dance wildly around her feet. The entire room is bathed in the pulsing, intensifying pink glow from the magic circle, casting haunting shadows as the camera sweeps up, revealing her legs kicking as if fighting invisible restraints.",
