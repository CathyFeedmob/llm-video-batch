  "video_prompt": "Translucent, metallic flower's luminous petals subtly shift color, reflecting shimmering light as if illuminated from within. Delicate, stylized metallic leaves slowly unfurl from a polished stem.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a vertical full shot of a luminous, translucent metallic flower resembling a peony or camellia, centered against a soft gray background. The flower's multi-layered petals appear as woven, pearlescent optical fibers, with intensely glittering white and golden-orange light reflections. The color subtly shifts from cool blue-white to warm peach/pink, with detailed rose-gold stamens. A slender, rose-gold metallic stem with glowing, translucent metallic leaves extends downwards. The overall aesthetic is ethereal and futuristic, with soft, even lighting emphasizing the flower's radiant beauty.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Luminous petals subtly transition through a spectrum of colors, their surfaces rippling with dynamic, shimmering reflections as an internal light source continuously pulses. From the stem, elegant leaves gracefully unfurl, their metallic sheen catching and distorting the shifting light."
