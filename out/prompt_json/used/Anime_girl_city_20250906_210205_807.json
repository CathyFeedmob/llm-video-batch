    "image_prompt": "A detailed image generation prompt for recreating this image would be:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A lonely anime girl with short black hair and glowing electric blue eyes, dressed in dark, slightly tattered clothing, sitting on the edge of a tall, dark building overlooking a sprawling futuristic cyberpunk city at dusk. The city lights below glow vibrantly in yellow and orange hues, contrasting with the cool blue and teal tones of the buildings and the hazy, textured sky. The girl is in profile view, gazing out at the cityscape with a contemplative or somber expression. The composition is a high-angle shot, looking down over her and the city. There are subtle details of wires or cables dangling from above the left side of the frame. The overall atmosphere is melancholic and introspective, with a highly detailed, painterly texture suggestive of digital brushstrokes, giving a slightly gritty, washed-out feel. Inspired by Ghost in the Shell aesthetics with a focus on depth and urban isolation.\"\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Anime girl.\n*   **Appearance (Girl):** Short black hair, glowing electric blue eyes, dark/tattered clothing.\n*   **Pose/Action:** Sitting on building edge, profile view, gazing at city.\n*   **Setting:** Edge of tall, dark building, overlooking a sprawling futuristic cyberpunk city.\n*   **Time of Day/Lighting:** Dusk/night, city lights glowing.\n*   **Colors:** Dominant cool blues and teals (sky, buildings, girl's clothing), contrasting vibrant yellow and orange (city lights), electric blue (girl's eyes).\n*   **Composition:** High-angle shot, looking down, emphasis on depth, girl prominent in foreground/midground, city in background.\n*   **Atmosphere/Mood:** Lonely, melancholic, introspective, urban isolation.\n*   **Style/Technique:** Anime art style, highly detailed, painterly texture, digital brushstrokes, slightly gritty/washed-out feel.\n*   **Specific Details:** Wires/cables dangling on left.\n*   **Influence (Optional but helpful):** Ghost in the Shell aesthetics.",
