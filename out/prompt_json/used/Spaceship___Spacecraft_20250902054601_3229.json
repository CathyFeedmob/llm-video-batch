  "video_prompt": "A camera slowly tilts upward, revealing a vast, bustling futuristic space scene. Countless spacecraft zip through the frame; a sleek ship streaks by, leaving a vibrant purple exhaust trail. Another ship fires a concentrated teal energy beam forward. Thick bands of radiant pink and purple light pulse and emanate from a gargantuan linear space structure. Bright neon trails constantly crisscross the background as light-speed streaks or distant energy discharges. A prominent glowing pink and purple ring pulsates, with a fainter one shimmering above. Subtle, colorful nebulae slowly shift in the dark cosmic backdrop.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, broken into logical sections for clarity, suitable for an image generation model:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA vibrant, dynamic, futuristic sci-fi space city, bustling with colossal structures and abundant spacecraft, set against a dark, starry cosmic backdrop with subtle blue and purple nebulae. Tilted upward worm's-eye view, emphasizing immense scale.\n\nDominating the left and center is a colossal linear space station, metallic, modular, with intricate geometric patterns and countless glowing orange, teal, pink, red apertures. Thick radiant pink and purple light bands diagonally traverse this structure.\n\nDiverse spacecraft are in motion: a sleek dark foreground ship (bottom-right) with bright orange cockpit lights and a vibrant purple exhaust trail. Midground armed ships, one firing a concentrated teal energy beam.\n\nAbundant neon light trails (teal, green, blue) crisscross the right side as light-speed streaks. A prominent radiant pink and purple glowing ring/portal is mid-left, with a fainter similar ring above it.\n\nColor palette: dominant cool tones (deep blue, purple, teal) powerfully contrasted by hot neon (pink, orange, green) from all artificial lights and energy effects. Ethereal glow, ultra detailed, cinematic lighting, octane render.",
