    "video_prompt": "A sorceress, her iridescent attire shimmering like liquid light, transitions her intense gaze into a subtle, knowing smile. Her gloved hand moves to subtly adjust her segmented staff, which pulses with arcane light. Behind her, an elaborate circular mechanism of glowing teal and polished gold rings slowly rotates and re-aligns. Embedded gems within the structure pulse with energy, as thin teal filaments dynamically extend, crisscross, and retract. Hidden gears subtly turn, while magical motes drift and sparkle throughout the scene, enhancing the shifting, ethereal light.",
