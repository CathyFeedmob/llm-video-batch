    "video_prompt": "Falling rose petals gently drift into the vase, settling among those already inside. wisps of smoke subtly curl and dissipate around the rose. The flame within the lantern flickers softly, casting a gentle, shifting light on the surrounding moss and petals. A very slow, almost imperceptible zoom out reveals more of the mossy ground.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:** A vibrant, dark pink rose with deep green leaves stands upright in a clear, ornate glass vase, filled with water. Several detached rose petals, in the same dark pink, are gracefully suspended within the water inside the vase and also scattered across the ground. Wisps of ethereal, light blue smoke drift and swirl elegantly throughout the dark background, encircling the rose and extending upwards. A warm, glowing lantern with a visible candle flame sits on the left side of the foreground, casting a soft, inviting light. The vase and lantern are positioned on a textured bed of bright green moss and dark, rich soil, which covers a flat surface like a tabletop or ground. The overall lighting is subdued, with warm light radiating from the lantern and a soft glow on the vase, creating a mysterious and romantic atmosphere. The composition is centered on the rose and vase, with the lantern as an accent.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Main Subject:** A single, dark pink rose with tight petals and deep green leaves, stem visible.\n*   **Vase:** Clear, transparent glass vase with a slightly curved, elegant shape, filled with water.\n*   **Rose Petals:** Dark pink, ranging from floating in the vase water to scattered on the ground.\n*   **Smoke:** Light blue, translucent, flowing smoke creating swirling patterns in the background.\n*   **Lantern:** Ornate, vintage-style metal and glass lantern with a lit candle inside, emitting warm light.\n*   **Ground/Surface:** A landscape of bright green moss and dark brown soil, with small pebbles interspersed.\n\n**Style:** Realistic yet slightly ethereal and artistic, with a focus on capturing light and texture.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Central Focus:** Rose in the vase is the primary focal point, slightly off-center to the right.\n*   **Foreground:** Lantern on the left, moss, soil, and scattered petals.\n*   **Midground:** Rose in vase.\n*   **Background:** Dark, smoky atmosphere.\n*   **Depth:** Achieved through layering of foreground elements, the vase, and the smoky background.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Dark pink (rose, petals), deep green (leaves, moss), light blue (smoke), warm yellow/orange (lantern light), dark grey/black (background, soil).\n*   **Contrast:** Vibrant rose and warm lantern light against a darker, cooler background.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Source:** Primary light source from the lantern, casting a warm glow on the surrounding moss and the base of the vase.\n*   **Effect:** Highlights the rose, the transparency of the vase, and the swirling smoke. Creates a moody, intimate ambiance.\n*   **Intensity:** Soft and atmospheric, not harsh or bright.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Romantic, mysterious, tranquil, and slightly melancholic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rose petals **slowly fall**, gracefully **drifting** into the vase, **nestling** amongst existing ones. **Subtle wisps of smoke curl**, then **dissipate** around the rose. The lantern flame **flickers softly**, **casting a gentle, shifting light** on the surrounding moss and petals. The view **imperceptibly zooms out**, **gradually revealing** more mossy ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Shattered fragments of the vase explode outwards. Rose petals, infused with dark energy, spiral violently upwards, tearing through the smoke and forming a vortex. The lantern's flame erupts into a blinding pyre, violently incinerating the moss. The entire scene distorts, ripping apart in a rapid, chaotic zoom out, revealing a desolate void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Rose petals reverse their fall, spontaneously reattaching to the ascending bud within the vase. Smoke coils into intricate, impossible geometric patterns before vanishing. The lantern flame absorbs light, pulling luminosity from the environment and casting shadowed forms onto the morphing moss. The ground subtly shifts and ripples, swallowing stray petals, as the entire scene expands and contracts like a breathing organism.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic zoom-out from the vibrant pink rose reveals petals cascading into the vase, swirling amongst the others. wisps of smoke gently entwine around the rose, slowly ascending into the dark expanse above. The camera pans down, revealing a warm lantern, whose flickering flame casts an ethereal glow on the moss and fallen petals, as the scene slowly dissolves into shadow.",
