    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down into key components, that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A futuristic female stormtrooper standing confidently on the palm of an enormous, highly detailed, steampunk-styled robotic arm. The robotic arm is positioned on a city street.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Stormtrooper:** Dressed in white and black streamlined stormtrooper armor, including a helmet, chest piece, gauntlets, and boots. She wears a short black pleated skirt over her armor. Her posture is upright and assertive.\n*   **Robotic Arm:** Massive in scale, almost like a giant cannon or heavy machinery. Predominantly dark metallic (charcoal/black) with intricate gold and brass accents. Features include glowing blue neon strip lights along its length, internal ribbing/vents, and a large cannon-like barrel at the top. The \"fingers\" of the hand are segmented and robotic.\n*   **Cannon Effect:** The barrel of the robotic arm is actively firing a powerful, bright golden-orange energy beam or laser, with numerous fiery sparks and particles emanating outwards. The light from the beam illuminates the surrounding area.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Perspective:** Low-angle, wide shot looking up at the stormtrooper and the robotic arm, emphasizing their grandeur and the arm's immense size.\n*   **Framing:** The stormtrooper is centered on the robotic hand. The robotic arm dominates the mid-ground, extending diagonally upwards towards the top right.\n*   **Background:** Blurry, futuristic city street at dusk or night with tall buildings and brightly lit neon signs in various colors (blue, purple, orange) that create bokeh effects. The sky is dark and cloudy/stormy, further enhancing the dramatic atmosphere.\n*   **Foreground:** The textured, slightly wet surface of a city street or pavement, reflecting some of the neon lights and scattered with glowing sparks from the cannon.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Dark metallics (black, charcoal), gold, and bright blue neon.\n*   **Accent:** White (stormtrooper armor), fiery golden-orange (cannon beam, sparks), various neon colors (purple, blue, orange, pink) in the background.\n*   **Overall Palette:** A rich contrast between dark, metallic tones and vibrant, glowing lights.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Primary Source:** Intense, focused light emanating from the cannon's energy beam, casting strong highlights and dramatic shadows.\n*   **Secondary Sources:** Glowing blue neon on the robotic arm, ambient light from distant city neon signs (creating bokeh), subtle reflections on the wet ground.\n*   **General Illumination:** Dim, moody urban setting, enhanced by the artificial lights.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Futuristic, sci-fi, epic, powerful, dramatic, slightly mysterious.\n*   Conveys a sense of immense scale and advanced technology.\n\n**Style:**\n*   High detail, realistic rendering with a hint of cinematic polish.\n*   Influences of cyberpunk/sci-fi and steampunk aesthetics.\n*   Sharp focus on the main subjects with a shallow depth of field for the background.\n\n**Artist Inspired (Optional, if specific is desired):**\n*   Blizzard cinematic art, Cyberpunk 2077 concept art, Neill Blomkamp's visual style.\n\n**Technical Descriptors:**\n*   Ultra-detailed, photo-realistic, volumetric lighting, ray tracing, cinematic shot, 8K, vivid colors, dynamic composition, dramatic lighting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refinement 1:\n\n**Dynamic camera push-in, subtle upward tilt, blue neon lights flicker and glow on the giant arm, sparks drift upwards from the laser cannon, distant street lights shimmer.**\n\nRefinement 2:\n\n**Camera pushes in and tilts slightly up. Blue neon lights on the giant arm flicker and intensify. Sparks from the laser cannon float upwards. Distant street lights subtly shimmer.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Crumbling buildings violently sway, the giant arm's neon pulses with explosive energy, its laser cannon erupting in a blinding, chaotic stream of sparks. The stormtrooper, poised precariously, is caught in a whirlwind of impossible motion as ground fissures burst open, swallowing the cityscape in a cataclysmic, shimmering inferno.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Dynamic camera push-in with a slight upward tilt, the giant arm's blue neon pulses, drawing in distant streetlights that stretch into shimmering tendrils. Sparks from the laser cannon swirl downwards, coalescing into liquid light that rewinds into the cannon. The stormtrooper floats, feet dissolving into a constellation of white stars, then reforming as the arm's fingers spontaneously sprout glowing floral patterns.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Dynamic push-in through a bustling sci-fi cityscape; the camera glides close to the giant cannon, emphasizing the vibrant blue neon glow. Sparks erupt from the powerful laser cannon, casting dramatic light onto the stormtrooper's armored form. The camera arc gracefully around the Stormtrooper, showcasing her stance on the colossal hand, culminating in a wide shot to reveal the grand scale of the city, illuminated by shimmering streetlights, as the cannon powers down with a soft, settling glow.",
