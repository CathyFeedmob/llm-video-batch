    "video_prompt": "Flickering flames in the foreground and midground, subtly shifting shadows cast by the large figure, gentle sway of the tattered fabric on the figure's leg. The bright orange ring on the weapon on the left hand could pulse gently. A very subtle slow zoom out, starting closer to the figure, could finish the shot.",
    "image_prompt": "A powerful and imposing Warhammer 40k Space Marine, likely a Blood Angel or a chaos variant like a Word Bearer, stands prominently in a destroyed, war-ravaged city. The Space Marine is clad in dark red and black power armor with gold and grey accents, showcasing intricate details and battle damage. Its shoulder pads are oversized, and the helmet design is menacing with glowing blue eyes. The Space Marine holds what appears to be a plasma gun or similar futuristic weapon in its left hand, with a glowing orange ring on the barrel, and another weapon held casually in its right hand.\n\nThe composition is vertical, emphasizing the scale of the Space Marine, which dominates the lower two-thirds of the frame. In the background, other figures and debris suggest an ongoing battle or its aftermath, with visible flames and smoke indicating destruction. The overall atmosphere is dark, gritty, and apocalyptic, characteristic of the Warhammer 40k universe. The lighting suggests an overcast or polluted sky, with a muted color palette dominated by reds, greys, and blacks.\n\nAt the top of the image, there's a prominent title bar with the large text \"NIEAMER C129\" in a metallic, distressed font, reminiscent of a game title or war propaganda. Below this, smaller, faded text reads \"KSITAL M OF\". Further down, there are lines of illegible, small text, adding to the visual noise and thematic elements. The bottom right corner features a \"C.29\" signature or watermark.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Flickering flames dance. Shadows **subtly** writhe from the figure. Tattered fabric **gently sways**. The weapon's orange ring **pulsates**. A **slow, subtle zoom out** reveals more of the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Flames erupt violently, surging upwards. The massive figure lurches, armor grinding, right arm sweeping up to unleash a devastating barrage from the weapon, its orange ring flaring intensely. Its left foot stomps, shaking the ground as debris flies. Tattered fabric on its leg whips frantically in response to sudden, powerful gusts of wind. Shadows lengthen and contract drastically as distant structures warp and crumble, the whole scene vibrating with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The flames, now ethereal whispers, levitate and reform into shimmering, liquid shapes that slowly re-enter the ground. The large figure’s shadows detach, becoming sentient, swirling entities that dance erratically and fuse with the tattered fabric, which unfurls and solidifies into ornate, floating metal. The orange ring on the weapon expands into a pulsating vortex, drawing light and shadow inward, causing the very ground to ripple like water as it subtly inverts. The entire scene slowly rotates on an impossible axis, revealing shifting dimensional planes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, deliberate push-in reveals the towering figure, the camera tracing the ominous glow from the weapon. As flickering flames dance higher, an arc shot circles the massive warrior, highlighting the distressed fabric on its leg. A subtle zoom out reveals secondary figures moving amidst the rubble, their grim determination underscored by the shifting shadows. The orange ring on the weapon pulses, culminating in a powerful, close-up shot of the figure's determined gaze.",
