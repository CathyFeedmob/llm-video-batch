    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer across the surface of the large planet, streaks of light behind the flying spacecraft subtly lengthen, dust motes slowly drift across the foreground, and very slight rocking of the rover as if on uneven terrain.",
    "image_prompt": "A comic book style illustration depicting a vivid Martian landscape. The scene is dominated by a massive, red-orange planet filling the upper portion of the frame, showing intricate topographical lines and crater-like formations. Below, the dark blue Martian sky transitions to a rust-colored, rocky terrain. In the mid-ground, a smaller, reddish celestial body hangs in the sky, illuminated by shafts of light.\n\nThe foreground features a detailed, multi-wheeled and tracked rover, light-colored with dark grey tracks, capturing a sense of exploration and technology on an alien world. Its headlights glow faintly blue. In the background, other elements of a Martian outpost are visible, including what appears to be a landed rocket or shuttle, and other rovers or vehicles traversing the barren landscape. A futuristic spacecraft hovers in the sky, leaving streak marks behind it, suggesting movement or atmospheric entry.\n\nThe artistic style is reminiscent of classic sci-fi comics with bold outlines, strong color contrasts, and a somewhat flat, graphic quality that emphasizes the distinct shapes and forms. The color palette is dominated by reds, oranges, and deep blues and blacks, creating a dramatic and otherworldly atmosphere. The lighting is bright and clear, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the textural details of the planet and the ground.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle planetary shimmer, lengthening spacecraft light trails, slow foreground dust motes, slight rover rocking.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Giant planet's surface WRITHES with explosive tremors, cracks RIPPING open. Hypersonic spacecraft OBLITERATE the sky with SUDDEN, FIERY blasts, leaving violently twisting trails. Dust motes ERUPT into a WHIRLING STORM, obscuring the ground. The rover REARS UP, wheels SPINNING wildly, then SLAMS DOWN, sending shockwaves through the terrain. Outcroppings SHATTER, launching debris.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The colossal planet surface shimmers, revealing fleeting glimpses of an underwater city, its buildings undulating like seaweed. Streaks of light behind the spacecraft twist into glowing vines that wrap around the ship, propelling it backward into the sky. Dust motes shimmer into miniature, translucent creatures that defy gravity, morphing into impossible geometric forms before dissolving into liquid light. The rover subtly pulses, its treads melting into a single, rippling wave that carries it across the shifting Martian landscape, which breathes like a living organism.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide-angle lens slowly cranes up from the foreground rover, revealing its subtle rocking motion on uneven terrain. As the camera rises, streaks of light behind the flying spacecraft dramatically lengthen across the obsidian sky. It then swoops back down, panning across the Martian landscape as dust motes slowly drift. The sun’s harsh glow causes a subtle shimmer across the surface of the large planet, illuminating its cratered terrain.",
