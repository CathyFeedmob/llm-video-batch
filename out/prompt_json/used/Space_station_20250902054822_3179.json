    "video_prompt": "A colossal futuristic space station pulses with blue, red, and orange lights as a powerful lightning bolt strikes its core. A fleet of capital ships flies past, their engines glowing intensely, while smaller vessels dart through the bustling orbital space. Multiple brilliant lightning bolts crisscross the dark, stormy sky, weaving through the atmosphere and between the moving fleet. Flashes of light continually illuminate the ships and swirling clouds, signifying intense energy transfer or unfolding space combat.",
    "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to more concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Comprehensive):**\n\"Breathtakingly epic, dynamic science fiction scene. Low-angle perspective looking up at a massive, intricate dark metallic multi-tiered space city in orbit around an Earth-like planet. The city features a glowing blue core, red/orange lights, and downward-extending fins, and is struck by a powerful white lightning bolt. A diverse fleet of advanced spaceships surrounds it, including sleek white capital ships with red exhausts and smaller dark fighters with warm lights, all rendered with deep perspective. The sky transitions from dark starry space to a hazy blue-grey atmosphere with a cloudy planet horizon below. Multiple brilliant white lightning bolts crisscross the entire scene, weaving through ships and clouds, creating an intense storm, energy transfer, or combat effect.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\"Epic, dynamic sci-fi orbital scene. Low-angle view of a massive, dark metallic, multi-tiered space station with a glowing blue core, red/orange lights, and downward fins, struck by lightning. A diverse fleet of white capital ships (red exhausts) and dark fighters (warm lights) surrounds it. Sky transitions from starry space to hazy atmosphere, with a cloudy planet horizon below. Multiple brilliant white lightning bolts crisscross the entire scene, creating a powerful storm, energy transfer, or combat.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise - prioritizing key elements):**\n\"Low-angle, epic sci-fi space battle/storm. Massive dark metallic orbital city with blue core and red lights, struck by lightning. Surrounded by diverse white capital ships and dark fighters. Dynamic sky with stars, hazy atmosphere, and cloudy planet horizon below. Multiple white lightning bolts electrify the entire scene, illuminating ships and clouds.\""
