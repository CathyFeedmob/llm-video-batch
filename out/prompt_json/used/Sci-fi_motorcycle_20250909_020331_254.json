    "video_prompt": "Subtle ripples emanate from the bike's tires in the water, reflecting the glowing wheels. The rider's backpack subtly shifts with their posture. A faint mist rises from the marshland, gently drifting with the breeze. Clouds slowly traverse the twilight sky. The faint glow of the bike's lights flickers almost imperceptibly with engine vibrations.",
    "image_prompt": "## Image Generation Prompt:\n\n**Full Shot:** A powerful, futuristic motorcycle with glowing orange wheels and red taillight, ridden by a person with a backpack and helmet, as seen from slightly behind and above. The motorcycle drives through a shallow, winding stream or muddy path, reflecting the bike's lights.\n\n**Background:** The path leads towards a vast, desolate body of water (ocean or large lake) under a dramatic, overcast sky with muted teal and grey tones, suggesting dusk or dawn. The landscape is sparse, with dark, wetland-like vegetation and possibly some skeletal trees or ruins in the distance along the shore.\n\n**Lighting:** The primary light sources are the motorcycle's bright headlight casting a warm glow on the ground in front, and its glowing orange wheels and red taillight creating strong reflections in the wet surface below. The ambient light from the sky is soft, diffused, and cool-toned.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Post-apocalyptic, melancholic, solitary, and slightly mysterious, with a sense of journey or exploration.\n\n**Style:** Realistic but with a stylized, cinematic, and slightly dystopian feel. High detail on the motorcycle and rider, with softer details on the distant environment.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominantly cool blues, teals, and greys for the sky and water, contrasting with warm oranges and reds from the motorcycle's lights. Dark, earthy tones for the ground and vegetation.\n\n**Composition:** A dynamic shot with leading lines formed by the stream/path drawing the eye towards the distant horizon. The motorcycle is positioned off-center (right of frame) creating movement and a sense of depth.\n\n**Keywords:** futuristic motorcycle, rider, backpack, helmet, glowing wheels, red taillight, muddy path, winding stream, reflection, desolate landscape, vast water, overcast sky, dusk, dawn, muted teal, grey, post-apocalyptic, solitary, melancholic, cinematic, dystopian, realistic digital art, detailed, dramatic lighting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Water ripples expand from tires, reflecting glowing wheels. Backpack subtly shifts with rider posture. Mist rises from marshland, drifting with breeze. Clouds traverse twilight sky. Bike light glow flickers imperceptibly with engine vibrations.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent torrents explode from the bike's tires, ripping through the water, as glowing rims whirl insanely. The rider's backpack violently twists and contorts with aggressive maneuvers. Gale-force winds rip through the marsh, whipping mist into chaotic vortexes. Black clouds churn and shatter across the tumultuous twilight sky. Headlights flash and flicker wildly with violent engine rumbles, spewing intense bursts of light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The bike's glowing wheels pulse, casting ripples that warp time, pulling fallen leaves *up* from the water's surface to reattach to bare branches. The rider's backpack *inflates and deflates* with impossibly slow, rhythmic breaths. Mist *pours down* from the sky, forming ethereal rivers on the barren earth that flow *uphill* towards the distant ocean, as the clouds above *dissolve into constellations of light that blink in and out of existence*.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Camera, starting low behind the biker's glowing wheel, dramatically sweeps up and over the rider, revealing the vast, desolate marshland under a twilight sky. The camera then smoothly tracks forward, keeping the bike centered as subtle ripples emanate from the tires. A sudden, tense shot focuses on the rider's shifting backpack before widening to show the misty, cloud-laden landscape blurring past, emphasizing speed. The finale features a slow, dramatic aerial shot receding from the bike, highlighting the flickering lights and the endless, eerie horizon.",
