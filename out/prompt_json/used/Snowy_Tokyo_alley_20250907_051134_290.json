    "video_prompt": "Snowflakes drift downwards, landing on the ground and accumulating. Lights in shops flicker softly. Steam rises from a nearby vent. The lone figure's breath is visible as a wisp of vapor. Distant city lights shimmer through the haze.",
    "image_prompt": "A moody, atmospheric shot of a narrow, snow-covered alleyway in a futuristic or cyberpunk-inspired Japanese city at dusk or night. The alley is lined with old, multi-story buildings on both sides, adorned with numerous glowing or backlit Japanese signs and lanterns, casting warm orange and yellow light onto the snow. Overhanging wires and utility poles crisscross the top of the alley, adding to the dense, urban feel.\n\nA lone figure, seen from behind, walks away from the viewer down the center of the snowy path, wearing a dark, hooded jacket. In the hazy, distant background, large, modern buildings and a prominent, towering orange communications tower are visible through a light mist or falling snow, illuminated with subtle red lights. The overall color palette is dominated by cool blues and grays of the sky and snow, contrasted sharply with the warm oranges and reds of the artificial lights. The lighting is soft but vibrant where the signs glow, creating a sense of depth and a hint of mystery. The composition is a one-point perspective, drawing the viewer's eye down the alley, emphasizing the depth and leading towards the distant city structures. The ground is covered in a fresh layer of untouched snow. The style is hyperrealistic with a painterly touch, leaning towards a cinematic, high-contrast aesthetic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Snowflakes descent and accumulate. Shop lights subtly flicker. Steam billows from a vent. A visible wisp of vapor from a figure's breath. Distant city lights shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Snowflakes explode into ice shards, propelled by a sudden, unseen force. Shop lights surge, then flicker erratically, casting chaotic shadows. Steam from the vent erupts into a violent geyser. The solitary figure's breath billows, morphing into spectral forms that whip through the air. Distant city lights pulse erratically, growing, then vanishing with violent intensity. The very infrastructure convulses, wires coiling and snapping like angry serpents.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Snowflakes blossom upwards, coalescing into luminous petals that ascend. Shop lights pulsate, then dissolve into swirling nebulas. Steam condenses into liquid light, defying gravity to form a serene pool. The figure's breath materializes as spectral birds, fluttering backward into their chest. Distant city lights warp into echoing black holes, pulling the horizon inwards. The snow-covered path unfurls into a tapestry of impossible geometric patterns.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The snow-covered alley, illuminated by flickering shop lights, is filled with a soft, ethereal glow. A figure in a dark coat walks slowly, leaving footprints in the fresh snow. A low, dramatic tracking shot follows from behind, capturing the subtle shimmer of distant city lights through the hazy air. Steam elegantly curls from a nearby vent, briefly obscuring and then revealing the figure. The camera then performs a graceful, slow pan upwards, revealing the dense network of overhead wires and antennae, their forms silhouetted against the muted sky, before a slow zoom out to a wide shot, showcasing the snow-covered street extending into the distance, as if swallowed by the softly falling snow.",
