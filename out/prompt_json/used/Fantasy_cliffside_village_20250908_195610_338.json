    "image_prompt": "An enchanting, hyperrealistic depiction of a fantastical cliffside village at night, reminiscent of the Amalfi Coast or Santorini, but with a magical, ethereal quality. The village consists of numerous white, stucco-like buildings with terracotta or light-colored tiled roofs, built into steep, rugged cliffs that drop down to a serene, glowing turquoise bay.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Buildings:** Countless intricately designed houses and structures, varying slightly in size and shape, but consistently made of light-colored stone or stucco. They feature arched windows and doorways, some with ornate wooden or metal details, and many have balconies or small terraces. The buildings are terraced up the cliffs, connected by numerous winding stone staircases and paths.\n*   **Vegetation:** Lush green foliage, including ivy, small trees, and bushes, spills over walls and between buildings, adding a natural, overgrown feel to the ancient architecture. Palm-like plants are present in some areas.\n*   **Water:** A tranquil, glowing turquoise body of water at the base of the cliffs, resembling a bay or inlet. A small, illuminated waterfall cascades from higher up the cliff face into this water, creating ripples and reflections of light.\n*   **Sky:** A deep indigo night sky filled with countless sparkling stars of varying sizes, with a few larger, more prominent ones. A prominent, crescent moon dominates the upper right sky, radiating a vibrant, ethereal teal or light blue glow, illuminating parts of the village and water.\n\n**Style:**\nHyperrealistic, fantastical, architectural landscape, highly detailed and intricate. The style blends elements of historical Mediterranean architecture with a dreamlike, almost fairytale aesthetic.\n\n**Composition:**\nA wide, elevated view looking down and across the village, showcasing its vastness and the dramatic verticality of the cliffs. The composition leads the eye from the illuminated sky and moon down through the layers of buildings to the glowing water below. The village fills most of the frame, with the sky and water acting as prominent backdrops.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** White (buildings), deep indigo/navy (sky), glowing turquoise/teal (moon, water), warm yellow/orange (lights).\n*   **Accents:** Dark green (foliage), light gray/stone (cliffs, paths).\n*   **Overall Palette:** A harmonious blend of cool blues and warm yellows, creating a sense of peace and warmth.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Moonlight:** The large crescent moon is a primary light source, casting a soft, ethereal blue glow over the upper parts of the village and the water.\n*   **Artificial Lights:** Warm, inviting yellow and orange lights emanate from the windows and interiors of nearly all the buildings, as well as from strategically placed lanterns along paths and terraces. These lights create a cozy, habitable atmosphere and highlight the intricate details of the architecture.\n*   **Reflections:** The artificial lights and moonlight reflect beautifully on the glowing water.\n*   **Shadows:** Soft, natural shadows add depth and dimension to the cliffs and buildings, enhancing the realism.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nMagical, serene, mystical, cozy, ancient, and dreamlike. It evokes a feeling of wonder and tranquility, inviting the viewer into a fantastical nighttime world.\n\n**Detailed Prompt:**\n\"Hyperrealistic, wide, elevated shot of a fantastical cliffside village at night, built into towering, rugged cliffs overlooking a glowing turquoise bay. Countless intricate white stucco buildings with arched windows and glowing warm yellow interiors are terraced up the steep cliffs, connected by winding stone staircases and pathways. Lush green foliage and ivy spill over ancient walls. A small, illuminated waterfall cascades into the glowing blue water below. The deep indigo night sky is filled with sparkling stars. A large, radiant crescent moon, emitting an ethereal teal glow, dominates the upper right sky, casting soft light over the village and water. Warm light spills from every window and from lanterns along paths, creating a cozy and magical ambiance. Mystical, serene, dreamlike atmosphere.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle window glows flicker and ripple on the water. A faint, shifting glow emanates from the waterfall. Stars subtly twinkle and drift. Foliage barely sways.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings writhe, twisting and reforming. Water surges upward, a chaotic geyser, then explodes into fiery tendrils. Stars rupture, scattering pulsating light. Moon fragments cascade, igniting the landscape. Foliage whips violently, tearing through cliffs, revealing pulsating portals. Fiery meteor showers ignite windows, which then shatter and reform into monstrous eyes. The night sky rips apart, displaying an astral vortex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses intermittently on falling water, mist curling upwards. Building lights pulse erratically, casting shadows that stretch and shrink. The moon slowly fragments into shimmering dust, reforming as a cluster of bioluminescent jellyfish swimming across the night sky, their tendrils gently pulling the stars like cosmic strings. Water ripples transform into glowing, ethereal ribbons that float around buildings.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The crescent moon glows, its light reflecting off the white buildings clinging to the cliffside. The camera slowly pans down, revealing a cascading waterfall and a vibrant turquoise pond below. Subtle twinkles appear in the night sky as the camera arcs over the village, showcasing the intricate architecture and glowing windows. The camera gently glides over the water, revealing a serene, magical scene.",
