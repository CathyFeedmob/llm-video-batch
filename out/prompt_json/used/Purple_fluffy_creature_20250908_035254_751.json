    "video_prompt": "The little creature's fur gently sways, its eyes subtly blink, and its tongue twitches. The leaves on the bamboo branches subtly sway in the breeze. Water drips slowly from the grassy cliff edge, forming ripples on the surface below (if visible in the full image). The purple fruit glows with a soft, subtle pulse.",
    "image_prompt": "A cute, fluffy, cartoon-style purple and white weasel-like creature with large, sparkly purple eyes is sitting on a mossy rock ledge, clutching a glowing purple fruit. Its tongue is slightly out, licking its lips, and it has small fangs showing. The creature's fur is fluffy, with white areas on its face, belly, and paws, and purple markings around its eyes, ears, and back. Its paws have visible pink claws. The large, round purple fruit has white speckles and a green stem, and it emits a soft purple glow from its base.\n\nThe rock ledge is covered in vibrant green moss with tiny white flower-like specks. Water droplets drip from the edge of the rock. In the background, there's a lush bamboo forest with tall green bamboo stalks and some green leaves in the foreground and background. The overall atmosphere is light and airy, with a soft misty haze in the distant bamboo.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are purple (creature, fruit), green (bamboo, moss), and white (creature's fur, speckles on fruit). Background has a soft blue-green hue.\n**Lighting:** Soft, ethereal, with a warm glow emanating from the fruit. Highlights on the creature's eyes and fur.\n**Composition:** Portrait orientation, close-up of the creature with the fruit, centered on the rock ledge. The bamboo forest extends into the top and sides of the frame, providing depth.\n**Style:** Cartoon, whimsical, cute, fantasy.\n**Atmosphere:** Enchanting, peaceful, playful.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The creature's fur erupts, spines extending as its eyes flare, pupils widening and morphing. The tongue whips out, impossibly long, darting and retracting. Bamboo branches lash violently, leaves tearing free and swirling like tiny green tornadoes. Water blasts upward from the cliff, defying gravity, then crashes down in a torrent. The purple fruit explodes with light, sending shockwaves rippling across the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The little creature's fur dissolves into shimmering mist then re-coalesces, its eyes spin like galaxies, and its tongue stretches infinitely, tasting parallel dimensions. Bamboo branches ripple in a silent, inverted wind, leaves morphing into tiny, luminescent fish that swim upwards. Water defies gravity, forming liquid sculptures that sprout from the cliff, solidifying briefly into crystal before evaporating into stardust. The purple fruit, a glowing singularity, pulses with impossible colors, each beat warping the surrounding landscape, reflecting an endless fractal within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A gentle breeze rustles the bamboo leaves from left to right. The camera slowly zooms in on the creature. Its fur sways softly while its large eyes blink, expressing curiosity. The creature's tongue subtly twitches as it holds the glowing purple fruit. Water droplets slowly drip from the cliff, forming tiny ripples below, reflecting the fruit's ethereal glow.",
