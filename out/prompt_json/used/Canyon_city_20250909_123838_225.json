    "video_prompt": "Smoke subtly billows from multiple distant structures. A gentle, undulating haze rises from the canyon floor. Birds in the sky flap their wings languidly. The red lights on the industrial structures softly pulse. The figures' clothes subtly ripple with an imperceptible breeze.",
    "image_prompt": "A vertical fantasy cityscape illustration with a highly detailed, dystopian, gothic futurism aesthetic. The dominant colors are warm oranges, deep grays, and black.\n\nThe scene is set in a deep, dark canyon-like area, with colossal, rough-hewn rock walls rising on both sides, adorned with multi-layered, heavily fortified, brutalist structures. Patrolling this canyon are multiple advanced, surveillance-style cameras with glowing red lenses, positioned on various structures, and wires crisscrossing the frame.\n\nA central element is a large, weathered, industrial bridge system, spanning across the canyon at two levels. The structures are a complex mesh of girders, platforms, and aged, rusted metal. Two human figures, appearing small and silhouetted, stand on the lower bridge, looking out into the distance.\n\nThe sky above is filled with a dramatic, gradient sunset, moving from a bright, fiery orange at the horizon to a softer, lighter orange and peach higher up, hinting at an overcast or smoggy atmosphere. Wisps of smoke and faint birds are visible against the sky. The lower parts of the canyon are shrouded in a thick, dark mist, hinting at the vast depth and urban sprawl below, with distant city lights visible through the haze. The overall lighting is dramatic, with the warm sunset glow contrasting against the dark, industrial structures.\n\nThe style is painterly, with visible brushstrokes and a strong sense of texture and depth. There's a subtle cyberpunk influence with the surveillance elements and the oppressive atmosphere.\n\nThink: \"Sci-fi apocalyptic city, surveillance society, canyon city, sunset, cyberpunk gloom.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nSmoke unfurls from towering stacks, coiling and dispersing. A shimmering heat haze undulates from the canyon depths. Birds ascend and descend, their wings beating slowly. Distant red lights subtly intensify and dim. Fabric flutters imperceptibly, responding to unseen air currents.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Suddenly, massive industrial structures violently shudder and collapse into the abyss! The canyon floor erupts in a tumultuous, swirling vortex of dust and debris! Birds in the sky dive and screech, their wings thrashing frantically! The red lights on the industrial structures fiercely strobe and explode with blinding flashes! The figures are thrown off the trembling bridge, their clothes ripped apart by an unseen, violent gale!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Smoke swirls into solid black pillars, then shatters into glittering birds. The canyon floor breathes, its haze folding skyward, morphing into crimson mist that dissolves the structures. Birds fly backward, their wings transforming into crystalline fans. Red lights pulsate, then detach, hovering as luminous eyes before merging into a singular, liquid sun. The figures’ clothes unravel into ribbons of light, weaving impossible patterns in reverse time, drawing them into the shimmering abyss.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pans from the eerie canyon depths, past watchful, gently pulsing red lights, to reveal two figures traversing a rusty bridge overhead. As the sun sets in a fiery blaze, a thick, undulating haze billows from the abyss, momentarily obscuring the distant, smoke- बिलowing structures. The birds overhead suddenly swoop and dive, mirroring the growing tension. A low, unsettling hum emanates from the surrounding industrial sprawl, building to a crescendo as the camera quickly zooms in on the figures, who pause, their clothes rippling violently against an unseen force, before rushing forward.",
