    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA highly detailed, hyperrealistic render of a futuristic, steampunk-inspired folding knife, partially opened, showcasing its intricate internal mechanisms. The knife features a matte grey main body with polished gold metallic accents, gears, and exposed springs. The blade is silver with subtle etched patterns and text that appears to be in an alien script. The hilt has visible screws, a central circular pivot point in gold and grey, and an ergonomic, textured grip. The overall aesthetic is industrial and mechanical, with a clean and sophisticated feel.\n\nThe knife is positioned dynamically off-center, slightly angled, on a dark charcoal grey background. To the left and right, overlaid on the background, are technical blueprints and schematics of the knife. These blueprints are rendered in a light, almost glowing, beige line art style, contrasting with the dark background. The schematics include top-down views, cross-sections showing internal components, and side profiles, with various technical labels and measurements (some appearing as stylized or fictional text).\n\n**Visual elements:**\n* Futuristic folding knife, partially open.\n* Intricate internal mechanisms: gears, springs, pistons, exposed wiring.\n* Matte grey and polished gold color scheme.\n* Silver blade with subtle etched patterns and text.\n* Visible screws and fasteners, ergonomic hilt.\n* Technical blueprints/schematics overlaid on the background.\n\n**Style:**\n* Hyperrealistic render.\n* Steampunk-inspired design with futuristic elements.\n* Industrial and mechanical aesthetic.\n* Blueprint overlay style.\n\n**Composition:**\n* Dynamic, slightly angled placement of the knife, off-center.\n* Blueprints strategically placed on left and right, balancing the composition.\n* Vertical orientation of the overall image.\n\n**Colors:**\n* Main knife: Matte grey, polished gold, silver.\n* Background: Dark charcoal grey.\n* Blueprints: Light beige/off-white line art.\n* Subtle glow on blueprint lines gives a slight sense of depth.\n\n**Lighting:**\n* Studio lighting, emphasizing the metallic textures and intricate details.\n* Soft, diffused light on the knife, with subtle reflections on polished surfaces.\n* Backlight subtly highlighting the contours of the knife.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n* Technical, precise, and sophisticated.\n* Sense of advanced engineering and design.\n* Clean and professional presentation.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle blade glint, metallic shimmer, internal glow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Blade flashes, catching explosive light as the internal mechanisms violently spring alive, gears grinding, steam hissing. The entire knife twists, vibrates, then rips itself apart mid-air, components reassembling into a searing, phantom weapon. Golden parts glow intensely, pulsed by unseen energy. It lunges, leaving trails of molten light, then shatters into a thousand glowing fragments which reform instantly, ready for another blinding strike.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A spectral shimmer dances across the blade as it impossibly lengthens, its metallic surfaces dissolving into liquid gold, glowing faintly. Internal mechanisms pulsate with a soft, ethereal light, detaching and rearranging themselves in mid-air to form dancing, crystalline structures that spin and warp into impossible geometries before phasing through each other like ghosts. Gravity reverses, sending the blade, now a sentient swirl of light, upward into a vortex of swirling colors, transforming dimensions as it ascends.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sleek, futuristic blade extends with a satisfying *whirr*, catching a subtle camera glint. The camera sweeps dramatically around the handle, revealing faint glowing internal mechanisms. A golden shimmer highlights metallic surfaces as the blade locks into place with a definitive *click*, ready for action.",
