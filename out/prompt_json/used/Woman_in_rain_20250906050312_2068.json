  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Full-body, eye-level shot of a young woman standing barefoot in the rain on a dark, wet street at dusk or night, surrounded by scattered red roses and petals. She is centered, looking down with a pensive expression, her dark, wet hair clinging to her face. She wears an oversized, translucent wet white collared shirt revealing white briefs or shorts underneath. Fair, smooth skin with water droplets. Background features out-of-focus warm bokeh from city lights (orange-yellow, red) and green traffic signals. Visible rain streaks and splashes on the reflective street, which mirrors the lights. Soft, romantic, melancholic mood, highlighting vulnerability and beauty. No watermarks.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A young woman's pensive expression subtly transforms. Rain streaks vigorously, constantly altering the background. Her wet hair shifts and moves, while translucent clothes ripple fluidly. Scattered red roses and petals sway and drift. Distorted car lights and traffic signals shimmer and morph, their reflections dynamically wavering in the agitated pooling water."
