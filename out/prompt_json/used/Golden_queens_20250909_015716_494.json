    "video_prompt": "A gentle, subtle rise and fall of the chest of the golden figure in the foreground, mirroring a slight shimmer on the golden surface of the background statue. The jewels on the foreground figure's headpiece and earrings glint softly, as if catching a gentle, shifting light source. A very subtle, almost imperceptible vertical camera drift, pausing at the peak for a moment before descending slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "A close-up, highly detailed portrait of a beautiful woman with blonde hair, adorned in elaborate gold jewelry and armor, looking downwards with a soft expression. She wears a golden headband with multiple tiers of shimmering jewels, including emerald green and sapphire blue gems, and large, ornate dangling earrings that match. Her golden armor features intricate details and reflects light, along with gold necklaces draped across her chest. Her skin is fair, and her eyes are a striking green. To her right and slightly behind her, a sculpted head profile of a golden figure, possibly a statue, is visible, also adorned with golden and jeweled elements. The background features classical architectural elements in light tones, creating a sense of grandeur. The lighting is soft and warm, highlighting the reflective surfaces of the gold.\n\n**Art Style:** Hyperrealistic illustration with elements of classical art and fantasy.\n\n**Colors:** Predominantly gold and varying shades of yellow, with striking accents of emerald green and sapphire blue from the jewels. Subtle hints of teal and dark green in the background, contrasting with cream and light grey architectural elements.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused lighting coming from the right, creating soft shadows and specular highlights on the gold.\n\n**Composition:** Close-up portrait, rule of thirds applied subtly to the main figure. The golden statue in the background adds depth and a secondary visual element.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Elegant, opulent, serene, and mysterious.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Foreground chest gently undulates. Background statue's surface subtly shimmers. Headpiece and earring jewels softly glint, reacting to imperceptibly shifting light. Camera subtly drifts vertically, momentarily pausing at its apex before a slight descent.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The golden figure in the foreground EXPLODES from its seated position, armor pieces SHATTERING and REFORMING into a towering, winged form with blazing emerald eyes. The background statue RIPS from its base, becoming a monstrous golden golem, its features convulsing. Jewels on the foreground figure's headpiece DETONATE, showering emerald shards, while its earrings EXTEND into whip-like tendrils. The camera, in a VIOLENT, WHIPLASHING pan, captures the TRANSFORMATION, then CRASHES downwards as a wave of golden energy RIPS through the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "As the golden figure's chest unnaturally inhales, the background statue's surface shimmers, then ripples into liquid gold, absorbing and releasing light. Jewels on the headpiece detach, orbit the figure like tiny constellations, and then phase through her body, leaving ethereal trails. Her gilded skin subtly melts into shimmering liquid, then instantly re-solidifies, while a vertical camera drift phases in and out of existence, defying linear motion, revealing glimpses of alternative dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic & Dramatic Video Prompt:**\n\nDolly out slowly from a close-up on the foreground figure's jewel-encrusted face, revealing her full golden armor. A dramatic, slow pan then drifts right, showcasing the shimmering golden statue in the background, a silent sentinel. As the camera circles, a single emerald on the foreground figure’s ring flashes intensely, catching a sudden, unseen light source that casts long, dramatic shadows.",
