    "video_prompt": "The alien breathes subtly, causing slight shifts in its metallic skin. Wisps of smoke from the fiery ground gently curl and dissipate upwards. The light from the fire flickers softly, casting dancing highlights on the alien's body and the surrounding shattered glass. The glittery particles in the air shimmer with tiny, individual movements. The rainbow light band in the background shows a subtle, gradual color shift and gentle undulation. Tiny glints of light on the reflective surfaces subtly twinkle and fade. The overall camera position subtly zooms in and out and shifts left to right, creating a floating effect.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, cinematic, and futuristic rendering of an **Alien (Xenomorph-like)** creature, gleaming with metallic, iridescent scales in dark blues, greens, and purples, with bright blue and orange glowing accents on its body.\n\n**Composition:** The creature is in a dynamic, crouched pose, seemingly landing or rising, with its head slightly lowered. It is positioned centrally, partially obscured by volumetric, fiery orange smoke and clouds that billow around its feet and rise upwards, suggesting heat or plasma. The creature stands on a large, futuristic, circular structure made of reflective shard-like panels and intricate metallic rings, which appear shattered or fractured, reflecting bright light and colors. The circular structure creates a visual frame at the bottom of the image.\n\n**Background:** The upper half of the image features a vibrant, rainbow-colored, abstract background, composed of horizontal and vertical glowing bars and shapes, reminiscent of digital glitches or a highly advanced user interface. Text and abstract UI elements, some in a foreign script (possibly Chinese characters as seen in the original), float in the mid-ground. Sparkling starbursts and lens flares are scattered throughout the image, adding to the visual dynamism.\n\n**Lighting and Atmosphere:** The scene is dramatically lit with strong contrasting colors: fiery oranges and reds from the smoke and ground effects, glowing blues and purples on the creature and reflective surfaces, and the multi-colored spectrum of the background. The overall atmosphere is futuristic, mysterious, and intense, with a sense of action and power.\n\n**Style:** High-resolution digital art, hyperrealistic with a touch of surrealism, highly detailed textures, vibrant neon colors, volumetric lighting, futuristic sci-fi aesthetic.\n\n**No human figures, no text that isn't part of the UI/abstract elements, no real-world objects other than a stylized concept of a breaking ground/platform.**",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The alien's metallic skin subtly ripples. Smoke wisps from the ground, curling and dissipating. Firelight flickers, casting dancing highlights on the alien and glass. Airborne glitter shimmers with tiny movements. The background rainbow band subtly undulates and shifts color. Reflective surfaces twinkle and fade. The camera gently zooms and pans, creating a floating motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The alien roars, its metallic skin violently rippling and expanding. Fiery smoke explodes upwards, engulfing shattered glass as it shatters further. The ground beneath buckles and cracks. Rainbow beams in the background flash intensely, distorting wildly. Glittery particles swirl into a violent vortex. The camera lunges forward then abruptly jerks back, panning erratically as the alien lunges.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The alien's metallic skin ripples like liquid, its form gently distorting. Fiery smoke forms impossibly intricate, self-coiling patterns. Shattered glass shards defy gravity, briefly suspending themselves before reforming into impossible geometries. The rainbow band undulates in reverse, bleeding colors into the fabric of reality. Tiny lights coalesce into shimmering streams, then dissipate into impossible shadows. The camera shifts, creating a disorienting, warped perception of space.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pushes in on the Alien's metallic skin, revealing subtle respirations. Smoke from the fiery ground billows, twirling around its form as the fire intensifies, bathing the shattered glass in an orange glow. The rainbow band above pulses with electric colors, its light reflecting off the Alien's gleaming body. The camera then performs a sweeping crane shot, revealing the vast, shattered environment before slowly zooming out as the Alien subtly shifts its weight, a low hum resonating from its core.",
