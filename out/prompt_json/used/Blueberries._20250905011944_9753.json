  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Close-up, high-angle shot of seven vibrant, translucent blueberries (one slightly purplish) on a glossy white plate with a silver fork. Each blueberry has a light blue stem end and a dark, star-shaped calyx with light brown sepals. Bright, star-like highlights and reflections are prominent on the blueberries and fork prongs, especially on the two bottom-center berries. The blueberries form a loose cluster in the plate's center. The clean, glossy plate reflects shadows. The background is stark white and well-lit. Minimalistic, high-detail.",
