    "video_prompt": "A gentle sway of the trees and bushes inside the bus, subtle shimmering of the stars in the night sky, light flickering on the road from the bus headlights, tiny butterflies fluttering around the foliage inside the bus.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical, dreamlike image features a fantastical bus driving down a road, with a background inspired by Van Gogh's \"The Starry Night.\"\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA bus designed like a moving terrarium, with a lush, vibrant ecosystem inside. Green grass, small trees, and colorful miniature flowers fill the interior visible through clear windows. White butterflies flit among the plants inside the bus. The bus exterior is white with black trim, and a subtle, almost blueprint-like drawing of a landscape in green is visible on the lower side panel. The bus has working headlights and taillights.\nThe road is asphalt, marked with white dashed lines.\nThe roadside is teeming with miniature green grass and a variety of colorful wildflowers (yellow, orange, red, pink, white). Small, round topiary-like trees are dotted along the road.\n\n**Style:**\nThe overall style is a blend of whimsical, fantastical imagery for the bus and foreground, contrasted with a painterly, impressionistic background in the style of Vincent Van Gogh. The elements in the foreground have a slightly toy-like or miniature quality, with sharp details.\n\n**Composition:**\nThe bus is positioned slightly to the right of the center, driving from left to right at an angle, creating a dynamic diagonal line. The road curves gently. The background is dominated by the swirling, starry sky. The foreground elements (grass and flowers) are out of focus, creating a sense of depth and emphasizing the bus.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant blues and yellows in the sky, characteristic of \"The Starry Night.\"\nVibrant greens for the plants inside and outside the bus.\nBright, varied colors for the wildflowers in the foreground (yellow, red, orange, pink, white).\nGrayscale for the road and parts of the bus.\nWarm yellow for the bus headlights, creating a reddish glow on the asphalt. Red for the bus taillights.\n\n**Lighting:**\nThe scene is lit from an unseen source, possibly suggesting twilight or early morning. The bus headlights cast a prominent warm glow on the road. The overall lighting is soft but highlights the textures of the plants and the bus. The night sky is luminous with stars.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nMagical, serene, whimsical, and environmentally conscious. The combination of the fantastical bus and the iconic starry night creates a dreamlike and artistic atmosphere.\n\n**Image Generation Prompt:**\n\"A whimsical bus, designed like a moving terrarium, driving on a road. Inside the clear bus windows, there's a vibrant miniature ecosystem with lush green grass, small round trees, and colorful wildflowers. White butterflies flit among the plants inside. The bus is white with black trim and a subtle green landscape drawing on its lower side. The bus headlights are on, casting a red glow on the asphalt road with white dashed lines. The roadside is adorned with miniature green grass and various colorful wildflowers (yellow, orange, red, pink, white), with small topiary-like trees. The background is a highly detailed, swirling, impressionistic night sky rendered in the style of Vincent Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night,' with prominent blues and luminous yellow stars/moon. The foreground grass and flowers are slightly out of focus, creating depth. Dreamlike, fantastical realism, soft lighting.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Trees and bushes gently sway inside the bus. Stars subtly shimmer in the night sky. Headlights cause light to flicker on the road. Tiny butterflies flutter around the interior foliage.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The bus violently lurches as trees inside thrash wildly, bushes explode into chaotic bursts of foliage. Stars in the Van Gogh sky ignite into blazing supernova flashes, ripping across the canvas. Headlights on the road pulsate, beams violently strobing, making the asphalt ripple and crack. Butterflies within the bus transform into a frenzied swarm, tearing through the air like miniature missiles, blurring into a whirlwind of furious motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The bus gently ripples, its foliage exhaling stardust into the swirling vortex sky. Headlights project shimmering butterflies that phase through solid pavement, illuminating the asphalt as liquid light. Trees inside the bus stretch upwards, their branches dissolving into the starry night as the bus itself melts into a fractal dreamscape.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A grand cinematic sweep as the camera follows the bustling bus, transitioning into a close-up on the delicate butterfly fluttering amidst the vibrant greenery. A sudden, dramatic zoom out reveals the entire night sky, painted in Van Gogh's style, before a final, lingering shot on the shimmering headlights illuminating the road ahead.",
