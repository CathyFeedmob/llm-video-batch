  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:**\n\nVertical portrait of an imposing, metallic silver and grey anthropomorphic ape, resembling Sun Wukong. Its fur is made of sharp, reflective strands like solidified molten metal. A feathery grey smoke hovers above its head. Golden light emanates from its eyes, which contain intricate golden glyphs. A golden circular emblem adorns its forehead. The ape has an intense, resolute expression with a furrowed brow and slightly parted lips. Small, dark, stringy hair hangs from its chin. The background is a swirling vortex of dark greys and silvers, with scattered golden nuggets and teardrop shapes. Dramatic lighting emphasizes the metallic surfaces, creating strong highlights and deep shadows.",
