    "video_prompt": "Subtle glowing ripple outwards from the glowing circle, ocean waves gently crash and recede, stars very slowly drift across the sky, subtle atmospheric haze over the horizon.",
    "image_prompt": "A breathtaking wide-angle shot captures a lone figure in a hooded cloak, standing in the center of a glowing magical runic circle on a rocky outcrop at the edge of a turbulent sea. The circle emits an ethereal orange and white light, illuminating the churning water that crashes against the rocks, appearing soft and milky due to a long exposure effect.\n\nAbove, the night sky is filled with a mesmerizing display of star trails, radiating outwards from a central point, creating a sense of dynamic movement and cosmic energy. Some star trails are white, while others on the right side of the frame are a warm, golden orange, suggesting a celestial phenomenon or a distant sunrise/sunset. The coastline recedes into the distance, with dark, rugged cliffs meeting the vast expanse of the ocean.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is mystical, awe-inspiring, and slightly mysterious, blending elements of fantasy with natural beauty. The composition emphasizes the figure and the magical circle as the focal point against the dramatic backdrop of the coast and sky.\n\n**Composition:** Wide-angle, lone figure as focal point, low angle looking up towards the sky and across the sea.\n**Elements:** solitary figure in hooded cloak, glowing magical runic circle/pentagram, turbulent sea with milky long-exposure water, rugged dark rock formations/cliffs, dramatic night sky, star trails (white and golden/orange), distant horizon with subtle light.\n**Lighting:** Ethereal glow from the magical circle (orange and white), luminous star trails, subtle reflections on water and rocks, natural ambient moonlight/starlight.\n**Colors:** Dominant blues and grays of the sea and sky, dark earthy tones of the rocks, contrasting with vibrant golden orange and white glows from the circle and star trails.\n**Atmosphere:** Mystical, magical, awe-inspiring, cosmic, dramatic, serene yet powerful.\n**Style:** Fantasy art, long exposure photography, cinematic, highly detailed.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Expanding ring of light, gentle ocean swells and retreats,  gradual celestial drift,  haze subtly shifts across the horizon.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive energy surges from the glowing circle, violently rippling the ocean into towering, crashing waves that defy gravity, spraying upwards. Stars streak erratically across the sky, leaving fiery trails. The horizon pulsates with supernatural light, distorting and swirling in unpredictable bursts. The cloaked figure shimmers, its form flickering and expanding as the magic intensifies, threatening to shatter the very air around it.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Glowing ritual circle subtly distorts the water, causes waves to flow *inward*, pulling ocean *up* into the sky as falling stars reverse, streaking *down* into the magical circle, fueling the robed figure's ethereal glow. The horizon shimmers, revealing impossible celestial bodies that grow and shrink erratically.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A lone sorcerer, cloaked, stands amidst crashing waves at twilight, illuminated by a pulsating magical circle. The camera dramatically zooms out as a celestial shower of golden light rains down, illuminating jagged coastlines. The sorcerer raises their hands, conjuring a tidal wave of sparkling light. The camera sweeps low across the water, emphasizing the dazzling magic and the endless starry expanse.",
