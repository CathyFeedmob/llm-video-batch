    "video_prompt": "A subtle gust of wind causes the astronaut's suit to subtly ripple and the blades of Martian grass to sway gently. The distant larger planet appears to slowly rotate against the starry black sky, revealing new surface details. The small crescent moon in the distance subtly twinkles with reflected light. A faint wispy trail of dust drifts slightly in the foreground. The rover's large tires show a very slight compression, hinting at the vehicle's weight on the Martian surface.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A highly detailed, retro-futuristic sci-fi illustration depicting an astronaut standing on a rugged, reddish-orange alien planet surface, looking up at a colossal, multi-wheeled rover vehicle. The rover is equipped with a tall, slender white and red rocket launcher attached to its rear, pointing skyward. In the deep black sky, a massive, cratered orange planet dominates the background, with a smaller, crescent-shaped moon visible lower and to the left. The scene is bathed in a warm, amber glow from the large planet, creating dramatic shadows and highlights on the rover and astronaut. The art style is reminiscent of classic comic book illustrations or early science fiction concept art, with strong outlines, flat yet rich colors, and a clear, defined aesthetic. The ground features sparse, red-orange rocks and patches of dry, textured vegetation. Composition is dynamic, with the astronaut in the foreground, the large rover and rocket as the central elements, and the planets creating a grand sense of scale. A subtle, elegant arc trails behind a small, distant object in the upper left sky, hinting at motion. The overall atmosphere is one of awe, exploration, and the vastness of space.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Astronaut's suit and Martian grass subtly ripple and sway as a faint dust trail drifts. Distant planet slowly rotates, revealing new details, while the crescent moon twinkles. Rover tires subtly compress.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The massive rover suddenly rears back, its immense tires spinning violently as if struggling to escape the Martian surface. The larger planet abruptly erupts with cosmic fire, its surface churning into a chaotic maelstrom. The tiny crescent moon pulsates with blinding, explosive light, while a dust devil violently rips through the foreground, scattering debris. The astronaut's suit inflates dramatically, then collapses inward, and the Martian grass whips into a tempestuous frenzy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The faint dust trail swirls upwards, pulling the moon into its distorted crescent, which shimmers with inverted light, drawing the distant planet to spin backwards. The rover's tyres swell and deflate, causing the Martian grass to pulse unnaturally, while the astronaut's rippling suit begins to dissolve into thin air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Opens with a sweeping cinematic crane shot, revealing the majestic Martian landscape. A sudden, dramatic gust of wind whips across the surface, causing the astronaut's suit to ripple violently and Martian blades of grass to dance wildly. Pan across to the colossal planet, now dramatically rotating, its new surface details starkly revealed in a shifting spotlight. Zoom-in on the crescent moon, which begins to pulse with intense light. A thick plume of dust dramatically engulfs the foreground, momentarily obscuring the scene. The rover's massive tires visibly compress as the camera dramatically tracks its slow, weighty descent.",
