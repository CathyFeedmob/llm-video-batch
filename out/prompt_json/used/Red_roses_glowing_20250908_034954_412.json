    "video_prompt": "Ethereal particles and subtle light rays shimmer downwards, mimicking underwater shafts of light. The clear edges of the rose petals gently sparkle with a faint glint. Tiny glints of light occasionally appear and disappear on the petals and leaves.",
    "image_prompt": "A stunning vertical shot capturing a fantasy garden of glowing red roses with silvery-white petals, set against a vibrant crimson background. The scene is illuminated by ethereal light rays and sparkling particles descending from above, creating a magical, dreamlike atmosphere. The composition features a variety of roses in different stages of bloom, from tight buds to fully open flowers, all showcasing intricate details and subtle glitter. The foreground features prominent, large roses with visible stamens, while smaller roses recede into the background. Silvery-green leaves and red, tall, thin foliage elements complement the floral arrangement, adding depth and texture. The overall aesthetic is rich, luxurious, and romantic, with a touch of mystical wonder. The color palette is dominated by reds, with accents of white, silver, and gold from the sparkling light. The artistic style leans towards illustrative fantasy with a polished, high-definition finish. Elements resembling water ripples are visible at the very top of the frame.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "- Shimmering particles drift downwards, reflecting light in undulating rays.\n- Rose petals gently vibrate, catching subtle sequential glints.\n- Tiny, ephemeral light bursts sporadically emerge and vanish across the flora.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Crystalline roses erupt from the earth, their petals tearing open with explosive force as light shafts pulse and coil like living tendrils. Glints of light flash across thorn-sharp edges, scattering like shrapnel. Petals shed, not fall, but violently detach, spinning into chaotic vortexes of light. The entire scene pulsates with raw, unrestrained energy, building to an unforeseen climax.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Crimson roses pulse with bioluminescence, their clear petals exhaling swirling mists that condense into phantom light shafts. These shafts unravel upwards, drawing glittering particles from the leaves, which then ripple like liquid fire. Rosebuds bloom in reverse, inhaling pollen directly from the air, while leaves slowly de-grow, transforming into shimmering red tendrils that float lazily across the canvas.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly glides across an underwater rose garden, a soft light shimmer falling through the ruby-red water. It dramatically zooms in on a single, sparkling red rose, its petals catching the ethereal light. As the camera circles the rose, a burst of additional shimmering particles explodes from its center, then gently dissipates into the depths. The scene fades as the particles drift upwards, hinting at unseen currents.",
