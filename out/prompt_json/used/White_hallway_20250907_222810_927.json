    "video_prompt": "Subtle light rays shimmer across the polished floor, the reflections gently shifting and brightening. A faint, almost imperceptible pulsation of light emanates from the distant end of the corridor, suggesting a slow, deliberate breathing.",
    "image_prompt": "A striking, minimalist perspective of a modern hallway, dominated by clean lines and stark white surfaces. The composition emphasizes depth, with a long corridor formed by a repeating series of tall, rectangular white columns on both sides, creating a strong sense of perspective leading towards a light grey wall at the far end.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Columns:** Symmetrical, tall, and rectangular white columns lining both sides of the hallway, extending into the distance. There are narrow black horizontal lines where the columns meet the ceiling, creating a subtle contrast.\n*   **Floor:** Highly reflective, polished white floor, mirroring portions of the columns and the ceiling.\n*   **Ceiling:** Flat, white ceiling with occasional small, dark circular fixtures (possibly smoke detectors or small lights) visible in the foreground.\n*   **Far Wall:** A solid, light grey wall closing off the end of the hallway, with what appears to be a vertical seam or thin dark line in the center, hinting at a closed door or panel.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Natural Light:** Strong, bright natural light streams in from the side (implied by the shadows), casting long, distinct rectangular shadows from the columns across the polished floor.\n*   **Reflections:** The reflective floor creates sharp, clear reflections of the brightly lit columns and the ceiling, enhancing the sense of light and space.\n*   **Brightness:** The overall image is very bright and well-lit, with strong highlights on the white surfaces.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant White:** Predominantly white, creating a sense of pristine cleanliness and openness.\n*   **Subtle Greys:** Light grey for the far wall, adding slight variation and depth.\n*   **Black Accents:** Minimal black lines at the top of the columns, providing sharp definition.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Symmetry and Repetition:** Strong symmetrical composition with repetitive elements (columns), creating a rhythmic and calming visual flow.\n*   **One-Point Perspective:** Classic one-point perspective, with all lines converging towards the center of the far wall, drawing the viewer's eye into the distance.\n*   **Foreground/Background:** Clear distinction between the foreground (showing detailed reflections and shadows) and the receding background.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Modern and Minimalist:** Evokes a sense of modern architecture, simplicity, and clean design.\n*   **Spacious and Serene:** The abundant white space and light contribute to a feeling of openness, calm, and perhaps even a meditative quality.\n*   **Orderly and Pristine:** The perfect symmetry and immaculately clean surfaces convey order and a high level of maintenance.\n\n**Style:** Architectural photography, minimalist, abstract.\n\n**Artistic Impression:** The image feels like a high-end architectural rendering or a professional photograph of a contemporary art gallery or office building.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Light rays subtly undulate across the floor, their reflections gently breathing. A faint glow at the corridor's end slowly waxes and wanes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The polished floor explodes with blinding bursts of light, sharp reflections fracturing and scattering across the space. Pillars contort and lash out, their forms twisting violently. The distant end of the corridor rips open into a swirling vortex, consuming everything in a furious, rhythmic implosion of light and shadow. The entire structure shudders and breathes with violent force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The polished floor dissolves into liquid mercury, reflecting inverted light rays that pull the viewer *backward* through the infinitely receding corridor. Columns stretch and contract like breathing organs, their shadows detaching to dance independently on the ceiling. At the farthest point, a black hole of light pulsates, subtly *inhaling* the architectural elements one by one into an unknown dimension, while the reflections on the floor ripple into swirling, luminous portals that *exhale* pure light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in begins, gliding over the polished floor as subtle light rays shimmer and reflect, hinting at a hidden energy. The camera rises, revealing the endless, white architectural pillars, their shadows deepening and then brightening with each breath-like pulse from the distant end of the corridor. A final, sudden light surge engulfs the scene, marking a dramatic shift as the camera pulls back, hinting at an imminent unveiling.",
