    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze makes the long black hair sway subtly, with a few strands lifting and falling. The rough-hewn cloak shimmers slightly with soft cloth movement. The character's eyes subtly blink and shift focus. The camera makes a very slow, almost imperceptible dolly zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere, designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull-body shot of a solitary young woman, appearing around 16-18 years old, with extremely long, straight, jet-black hair flowing around her, some strands gently wind-blown to her left. She has a delicate, doll-like face with pale skin and dark, subtle makeup around her eyes, giving a serious, somewhat melancholic or distant expression. Her gaze is directed slightly off-camera to the viewer's right.\n\nShe is dressed in ancient, rustic, possibly tribal or shamanic attire. Her main garment is a large, asymmetrical, loose-fitting cloak made of textured, coarse, unbleached burlap or sackcloth in shades of muted earthy brown and beige. The cloak has frayed, raw edges with visible, loose threads and mesh-like woven sections, creating a worn, handmade appearance. Underneath the cloak, she wears a simple, knee-length, loose-fitting tunic or dress in a darker, muted olive green or charcoal brown, also with frayed edges and looking hand-stitched. Around her waist, she has multiple wraps of thick, rough cords or leather straps, tied in a knot.\n\nHer feet are adorned with crude, traditional Japanese Geta-style wooden sandals, but simplified: flat wooden blocks with a single strap over the toes, secured with rough, dark brown cords wrapped around her ankles.\n\nThe pose is static and slightly formal, facing forward with a subtle lean. The lighting is soft and ethereal, suggesting a misty or overcast environment, creating a sense of ancient mystery. The background is a dark, atmospheric, cavernous landscape or deep forest, with muted greens and blues, and indistinct, large rock formations or gnarled trees shrouded in fog or haze, adding to the somber, mystical atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by dark, desaturated earth tones (browns, greens, greys) with hints of deep shadows, enhancing the mood. The overall style leans towards dark fantasy or a gritty, realistic historical fantasy illustration. There's a subtle depth of field with the background slightly blurred.\n\n**Specific details to emphasize:**\n*   **Hair:** Extremely long, straight, black, flowing, wind-blown.\n*   **Face:** Pale skin, delicate features, dark eye makeup, serious expression.\n*   **Clothing Fabric:** Coarse burlap/sackcloth, frayed edges, visible threads, hand-stitched appearance.\n*   **Colors:** Muted earthy browns, olive green, charcoal, dark greys.\n*   **Footwear:** Simple wooden block clogs with rope ties, ancient aesthetic.\n*   **Background:** Misty forest/cavern, dark and atmospheric, blurred.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Mysterious, ancient, somber, ethereal.\n*   **Lighting:** Soft, diffused, suggesting mist or overcast conditions.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Long black hair subtly sways and lifts with a gentle breeze. The rough-hewn cloak shimmers with soft, flowing motion. Eyes subtly blink and shift focus. The camera executes a very slow, almost imperceptible dolly zoom, gently pulling back.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A sudden, powerful gale whips the long black hair violently around the character's head. The rough-hewn cloak billows and snaps, unraveling at the edges with explosive force. The character's eyes intensely dart and narrow, scanning an unseen threat. The ground beneath them cracks and splinters, sending shards of wood flying. A rapid, disorienting dolly zoom pulls back, revealing a swirling, chaotic void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The girl's long black hair, now a living nebula, spirals upwards, pulling the tattered cloak into a swirling vortex of shimmering moonlight. Her eyes, two miniature black holes, absorb the distant mountains, which then stretch and melt into elongated glass spires. Her wooden sandals morph into floating lily pads, carrying her upwards as gravity inverts. The entire scene, a shimmering oil painting, pulsates, reality itself rippling like a disturbed pond.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A haunting breeze whips the long black hair, revealing a flicker of intense eyes. The rough-hewn cloak billows and snaps, adding to the desolate atmosphere. As the camera slowly pulls back, the character subtly shifts their weight, hinting at an unseen presence. Then, a sudden, dramatic zoom into a single, determined eye, reflecting a distant, eerie light. The cloak swirls violently as the figure pivots, vanishing into the dim background.",
