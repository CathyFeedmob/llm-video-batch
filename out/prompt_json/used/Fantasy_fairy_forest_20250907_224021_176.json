    "video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom-in, twinkling particles drifting from the mushrooms, the fairy's wings gently flutter, her dress softly sways, leaves on the tree vine slightly rustle, and a distant mushroom in the background glows faintly.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, whimsical long shot of a fairy standing on a large, gnarled tree trunk forming two natural archways in a lush, magical forest. The tree trunk is adorned with numerous vibrant, multi-colored mushrooms of various sizes (purple, blue, orange, brown, and white with spotted caps). Green moss and vines meticulously cover parts of the tree and rock formations.\n\nThrough the lower archway, a winding stone path leads into the soft focus background, where hints of a mysterious, luminous figure or light source can be glimpsed. On one side of the lower arch, a small, intricate wooden bed is nestled within a hollow of the tree. Opposite it, a small wooden fairy door is built into the tree trunk.\n\nThe fairy in the center is a young woman with long, blonde hair and translucent, light blue wings, wearing a flowing, light pink and white ombr√© gown, delicately holding a small, pink flower. Magical dust motes and sparkling light particles drift around her.\n\nThe lighting is ethereal, with soft, dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating a mystical and enchanting atmosphere. The color palette is rich and vibrant, dominated by natural greens, earthy browns, and pastel shades of purple, blue, and pink. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye towards the fairy and the intricate details of the enchanted tree.\n\n**Style**: Fantasy, whimsical, enchanting, magical realism.\n**Composition**: Long shot, centered subject (fairy), balanced, detailed foreground and midground with a soft focus background.\n**Lighting**: Ethereal, dappled sunlight, glowing elements, magical particle effects.\n**Colors**: Vibrant greens, earthy browns, pastel purples, blues, oranges, pinks, and white.\n**Atmosphere**: Mystical, serene, enchanting, dreamlike.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom-in. Twinkling particles drift from mushrooms. Fairy's wings gently flutter, dress softly sways. Leaves on tree vine slightly rustle. Distant mushroom background glows faintly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive camera lurch and spin, a hurricane of iridescent particles erupts from every mushroom, their caps violently pulsing and expanding as if breathing. The fairy's wings violently tear the air, whipping her dress into a furious, swirling vortex. Tree vines thrash wildly, ripping at the air, and distant mushrooms detonate with blinding flashes of light. The ground cracks and heaves under this sudden, powerful surge of magical energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity reverses direction for the fairy and her flowing dress, pulling her upwards. The mushrooms slowly detach and float into the sky. Leaves on the vine unravel and re-spool themselves onto branches, while roots detach from the ground and rise. The distant glowing mushroom pulsates with inverted light, drawing surrounding particles inward like a black hole of luminosity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping cinematic shot reveals the majestic tree, colorful mushrooms sparkling. A gentle camera push-in highlights the fairy, her delicate wings softly fluttering, her gown swaying. As she reaches out, twinkling particles shimmer from the glowing distant mushroom, illuminating her face. A dramatic overhead shot as leaves around tree trunks rustle, enhancing the enchantment.",
