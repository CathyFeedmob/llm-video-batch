    "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photorealistic image depicting a charming scene of adorable kittens, resembling a playful harvest.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Central Focus:** A large, light beige/off-white toy pick-up truck serving as a miniature farm vehicle, heavily laden with lush fruits in its bed and on its roof.\n*   **Kittens:** Approximately 6-8 small, fluffy kittens of various tabby and ginger patterns, with bright eyes. Many are wearing miniature straw hats with colorful bands (e.g., blue, pink, green stripes).\n    *   One tabby kitten is prominently featured in the truck bed, appearing to hold a small orange fruit.\n    *   Another ginger/light-colored kitten is to its left, also holding a small orange.\n    *   Several other kittens are visible on the roof and in the front cab of the truck, some appearing to interact with small fruits.\n    *   At least one kitten is visible peering out from inside the truck cabin on the passenger side.\n*   **Fruits:**\n    *   A prominent display of ripe, vibrant oranges, varying in size, both in wooden crates in the truck bed and spilling around the vehicle. Some are perfectly round, others slightly irregular.\n    *   Bunches of light green grapes in a wicker basket in the truck bed.\n    *   Several ripe, pale green/yellow pears in a wicker basket in the truck bed.\n    *   Small, bright orange fruits (mandarins or kumquats) are individually placed around the kittens, some being held.\n*   **Background (Orchard/Farm Setting):**\n    *   An out-of-focus but clearly identifiable orange tree with numerous large, ripe oranges hanging from its branches, occupying the upper left and extending into the mid-ground. The leaves are a rich green.\n    *   A subtle suggestion of more orange trees or general greenery in the soft-focus distance, indicating an orchard or farm environment.\n*   **Foreground/Ground:** A dirt or gravel path, littered with scattered, dried autumn leaves in shades of brown, orange, and yellow. A wooden fruit crate overflowing with oranges is on the ground in the lower left.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Eye Level:** The viewpoint is slightly elevated, looking down onto the truck and kittens, at their eye level.\n*   **Depth of Field:** Very shallow depth of field, with the kittens, the truck, and the immediate fruits sharply in focus, while the background (tree and distant foliage) and the extreme foreground (leaves) are artistically blurred, creating a bokeh effect.\n*   **Arrangement:** The kittens are thoughtfully arranged around the fruits and truck, creating a sense of natural interaction and a lively, industrious atmosphere. The truck serves as a strong central anchor.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Tones:** Warm tones dominate, with rich oranges from the fruits, greens from the leaves and grapes, and earthy browns and yellows from the ground and dried leaves.\n*   **Kitten Colors:** Natural cat fur colors – various shades of brown, grey, cream, and ginger.\n*   **Truck Color:** Light beige/off-white.\n*   **Hats:** Straw yellow with subtle pops of blue, pink, green.\n*   **Overall Pallete:** A natural, inviting, and cheerful color scheme.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Type:** Natural, soft daylight, suggesting late afternoon or early morning sun.\n*   **Direction:** Appears to be coming from the upper right, casting gentle highlights on the kittens and fruits, and subtle shadows that add dimension without being harsh.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Bright and luminous, contributing to the healthy, vibrant feel of the scene.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Whimsical, delightful, heartwarming, and full of innocent charm.\n*   **Theme:** Evokes a feeling of autumn harvest, abundance, and the simple joys of nature and companionship.\n*   **Overall Impression:** A captivating, story-like image that is both adorable and visually rich.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Photorealism:** High level of detail and realism, making the scene appear tangible and lifelike despite the whimsical subject.\n*   **Sharpness:** Extremely sharp focus on the main subjects.\n*   **Artistic Blurring:** Utilizes optical blur (bokeh) effectively for background and foreground.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A soft breeze rustles the orange leaves and kitten's straw hats. Kittens slowly blink. Sunlight subtly flickers. Leaves gently fall.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A gale whips through, violently tearing leaves from the orange trees and snatching straw hats from the kittens' heads, sending them spiraling into the stormy sky. Oranges explode off branches, raining down like fiery meteorites, their juice splattering the truck as it lurches and twists, engines revving autonomously, struggling to break free from unseen forces. The ground shatters, sending dust and debris skyward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Wind picks up the truck, suspending it mid-air, as gravity reverses for the fruit, which float upwards and reattach to the tree. The kittens' hats spin, untwisting their straw fibers into ethereal light that dances around them. Leaves on the ground swirl upward, reforming into solid, sparkling emeralds.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow zoom into the vibrant orange tree, leaves swaying in the breeze. The camera glides down to reveal mischievous kittens, each donning a straw hat. A playful kitten bats at a dangling orange, causing it to rock. The scene shifts to a low-angle shot, dramatically pulling back as the truck slowly drives off with the kittens peeking out from the back, sunlight dancing on the vehicle's paintwork, leaving a trail of gently falling leaves.",
