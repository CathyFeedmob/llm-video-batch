    "video_prompt": "The neon yellow text blocks subtly shift and undulate across the elephant's body, as if breathing. The \"H\" characters on the trunk ever so slightly curl and uncurl, hinting at a very slow, continuous movement. Subtle light reflections gently sweep across the glossy surfaces of the black and yellow blocks. A very gentle, almost imperceptible zoom out reveals a tiny swaying motion in the tips of the yellow tusks.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed 3D render of an elephant sculpture made entirely out of black and bright yellow text blocks and strips, resembling an intricate and complex puzzle or a deconstructed typeface. The elephant is positioned in a dynamic, slightly angled view, with its head and trunk prominent. The text blocks are arranged to form the contours and features of the elephant, with a mix of bold, capital letters and smaller, unreadable characters in various fonts and orientations, some curving with the form of the elephant while others are stacked or jut out. The color palette is dominated by stark black and vibrant, almost neon yellow, creating high contrast. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the three-dimensional texture and depth of the text blocks against a clean, plain white background, which emphasizes the sculptural form of the elephant. The atmosphere is modern, artistic, and conceptual.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Neon yellow text blocks subtly undulate on the elephant's body, \"breathing\" and shifting. \"H\" characters on the trunk gently curl and uncurl. Light reflections softly sweep across glossy black and yellow surfaces. A very slow, imperceptible zoom out reveals a tiny sway in the yellow tusks.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Screaming yellow glyphs violently burst from the elephant's body, tearing and reforming into a pulsating vortex. The \"H\" characters on the trunk whip like furious tendrils, thrashing and coiling with aggressive speed. The black blocks splinter and shatter, reforming as jagged, lightning-fast text streams. The entire elephant surges forward, tusks glowing with volatile energy, as the ground cracks beneath its explosive movements.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The neon yellow text blocks on the elephant's body ripple like water, defying gravity as 'H' characters on the trunk untwist into blooming flowers, then recede. The black and yellow blocks exhale ethereal wisps, coalescing into swirling vortexes that invert the elephant's form. Tusks writhe like serpents, their tips impossibly stretching and then dissolving into a cascade of vibrant light particles which then re-form and collapse back into tiny swaying motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping, slow motion push-in on the powerful elephant, its body a mesmerizing mosaic of shifting yellow and black text, each block twitching subtly as if imbued with life. The camera dramatically zooms to the trunk, focusing on the \"H\" characters, which ripple organically, conveying a sense of slow, rhythmic breath. As the shot pulls back, a breathtakingly gentle sway of the tusks is revealed, bathed in soft, sweeping light reflections, hinting at an unseen, ancient force. The scene builds to a powerful, almost unsettling quiet stillness.",
