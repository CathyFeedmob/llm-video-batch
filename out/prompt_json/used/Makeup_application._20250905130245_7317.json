  "video_prompt": "Tiny nurse-beauticians, equipped with oversized tools, meticulously apply makeup onto a giant woman's face. They climb ladders, blend eyeshadow, precisely line lips, and move around her features, while other figures prepare tools and discard items. The background subtly shifts colors.",
  "image_prompt": "A surreal close-up, eye-level photograph of a woman's face being made up by tiny beauticians. Her face is a canvas, with vibrant blue-purple eyeshadow, long dark lashes, and glossy pink lips. Meticulous miniature figures in white nurse-like uniforms apply cosmetics, using oversized brushes and tools, and ladders to reach. The background is a soft peach and light blue gradient. Whimsical artistry.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Beauticians move across a woman's face, scaling ladders to reach features. They meticulously blend eyeshadow and precisely line lips, their movements focused and deliberate. Other figures actively prepare tools and discard used items. Simultaneously, the background fluidly transitions through a range of colors."
