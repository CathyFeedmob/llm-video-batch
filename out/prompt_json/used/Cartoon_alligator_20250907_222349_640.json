    "video_prompt": "A subtle sway of the plant leaves near the windows and at the bottom left. The crocodile's eye blinking, with a slight, gentle rise and fall of its chest indicating breathing. The fabrics of its overalls subtly shifting as if from a light breeze. A very subtle sparkle or gleam on the red apple.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, cartoon-style full-body shot of a friendly, anthropomorphic green crocodile wearing blue and yellow striped overalls. The crocodile stands smiling with its mouth open, holding a pink toothbrush in its left hand and a bright red apple in its right. Its eyes are wide and expressive, looking slightly upwards and to the right. The setting is a cozy, brightly lit room with wooden floors and pink and teal paneled walls. Large arched windows in the background reveal a sunny outdoor scene with green foliage.\n\nThe room is decorated with subtle details: various potted plants, framed animal pictures on the walls, and a colorful striped rug on the floor. Scattered around the rug are children's toys, including a blue block, a colorful open book, and striped balls. The lighting is soft and natural, with sunlight streaming in through the windows. The overall atmosphere is cheerful and inviting. The art style is reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with clean lines, bold colors, and a slightly textured appearance. There's a subtle vignette effect, slightly darkening the edges. In the bottom right corner, a small, stylistic \"c29\" logo is present in pink and white.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Plant leaves subtly sway. Crocodile's eye blinks, chest gently rises and falls. Overalls subtly shift. Red apple subtly gleams.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The plant leaves violently thrash, whipping around in an unseen gale. The crocodile's eyes bulge, rapidly blinking and darting, its chest heaving with desperate gasps. Its overalls rip and tear, threads unraveling, as the fabric warps and writhes. The red apple pulses with an intense, blinding light, then shatters into a thousand shards. The floorboards buckle, cracks spiderwebbing as the room violently shakes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The plant leaves at the bottom left morph into tiny, iridescent butterflies that flutter from the pot and encircle the crocodile's blinking eye. The crocodile's chest inhales, pulling the apple inward until it becomes a sparkling, beating heart within its scales. The overalls twist and unravel into a swirling river that flows upwards, defying gravity, as the carpet below unfurls into a starlit galaxy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A soft breeze ripples through the leaves, left and top, as a gentle chest rise indicates the alligator's breath. Its eye blinks open, the fabric of its overalls subtly shifting. A quick, dramatic zoom on the toothbrush, then cuts to the apple, which gleams with a subtle, enticing sparkle. The camera pulls back as the alligator's eye rolls, as if contemplating the apple.",
