    "video_prompt": "A subtle, slow pan upward reveals the fabric gently swaying, almost imperceptibly. A very slight shimmer appears on the eye's surface, hinting at a tear forming. The light softly pulses as if reflecting from a distant source, and the eye blinks slowly, naturally.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA close-up, eye-level shot of a woman's right eye and the right side of her face, partially obscured by a textured, light beige and orange-striped headscarf or fabric. The focus is on the intricate detail of the and a small part of the nose.\n\n**Style:** Illustration, digital painting with a visible paper texture or pastel/colored pencil effect, reminiscent of traditional media but with clean lines. The strokes for the fabric and some skin areas should be visible, giving a drawn feel.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Eye:** Prominent large, bright brown-hazel eye with visible, subtle reflections in the pupil suggesting a window or city lights. Long, individual black eyelashes are precisely rendered on both upper and lower lids. A bright white specular highlight is present in the pupil area. The iris shows complex radial patterns and variations of brown and green/gold tones.\n*   **Eyebrow:** Dark, well-defined eyebrow with individual hair strokes visible.\n*   **Skin:** Warm, healthy skin tone, predominantly peach and light orange hues, with subtle pink undertones around the eye and nose.\n*   **Fabric/Headscarf:** A light beige or off-white fabric with horizontal stripes of burnt orange, sienna, and occasional white highlights, suggesting a woven or textured textile. The fabric gracefully drapes around the forehead and chin, partially covering the left side of the face and mouth.\n*   **Nose:** A small portion of the right side of the nose is visible, with a tiny, subtle highlight indicating a nose piercing or a reflection.\n*   **Hair:** A few strands of dark hair are visible peeking out from under the headscarf near the temple.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Cropping:** Extremely tight close-up, cutting off the top of the forehead and the bottom of the chin, focusing strongly on the eye and the interplay with the fabric.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The eye is positioned roughly along the upper-right intersection of the rule of thirds.\n*   **Diagonal Lines:** Strong diagonal lines created by the folds and stripes of the fabric lead the eye towards the central focus.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Warm oranges, peaches, light browns, and beige.\n*   **Accents:** Dark browns (eye, hair, eyebrow), subtle greens/golds (iris), white (highlights, fabric stripes), faint pinks (skin).\n*   **Palette:** Earthy, warm, inviting.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Soft, natural light coming from the front-right, creating subtle shadows and highlights that give depth to the skin and fabric folds.\n*   A distinct specular highlight in the eye, suggesting a light source.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Mysterious, gentle, and introspective. The partial covering of the face adds an element of intrigue.\n**Other details:** Small, handwritten text \"C29\" and \"T29\" at the bottom right corner, suggesting an artist's signature or code. Faint Chinese characters \"AI生成\" (AI Generated) in a small white rectangle at the top left corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The fabric subtly sways upward. A slight shimmer emerges on the eye's surface, growing with a soft, pulsing light. The eye then slowly blinks.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rapid, forceful gusts rip across the fabric, violently snapping it upwards and outwards in a chaotic flutter. The eye's surface explodes with a blinding, shattering shimmer, mirroring an inferno of reflections. Light bursts and refracts with intense, erratic pulses, as the iris twists and distorts, suddenly dilating and constricting with alarming speed, like a monstrous, ravenous maw.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The golden fabric, woven from sunbeams, subtly unravels into swirling nebulae that dance upward. The eye, a cosmic portal, slowly blooms with liquid starlight, reflecting impossible cityscapes within its depths where buildings drift skyward. As the cosmos inside begins to contract, the eye blinks backward, sucking light and sound into its core, revealing nascent galaxies instead of a forming tear.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, reverent pedestal up, trailing the ornate folds of the fabric as they softly billow, revealing the subject's face. A dramatic close-up, a gentle push-in on the eye. The light subtly shifts, intensifying the shimmer as a tear glides, luminescent, down the cheek. The eye blinks, a soft sigh of emotion.",
