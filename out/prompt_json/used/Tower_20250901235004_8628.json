  "video_prompt": "A monumental tower's arched windows display a dynamic, pulsing kaleidoscope of rainbow colors. Heavy clouds drift across the twilight sky, periodically revealing and obscuring an ethereal, pulsating light or distant lightning. Below, streetlights flicker on as the fiery sunset transitions to deep indigo, casting lengthening shadows across the urban landscape. Distant city lights twinkle, and bare tree branches gently sway in the foreground.",
  "image_prompt": "A monumental, multi-tiered cylindrical tower of dark reddish-brown brick, its numerous arched openings emanating a vibrant, luminescent rainbow glow. The tower's upper levels are dramatically ruined with jagged edges, dominating a vast urban landscape at twilight. The sky transitions from deep indigo and sapphire blue with heavy clouds to a fiery orange and golden yellow horizon. Below, warm orange-red streetlights illuminate dark brick buildings, casting long shadows. This high-contrast scene features cool blues against warm oranges, creating a fantastical, foreboding, and richly saturated atmosphere, blending ancient epic grandeur with a modern dystopian aesthetic, in a painterly style.",
