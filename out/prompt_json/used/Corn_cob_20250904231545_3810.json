  "image_prompt": "Close-up, high-angle shot of a partially husked ear of vibrant yellow corn, standing upright on a shiny, light off-white surface with a faint reflection. Light green husks are peeled back to reveal two-thirds of the cob, showcasing plump, aligned kernels with a gradient from pale to rich yellow. Golden-brown corn silk crowns the top. Well-lit, emphasizing texture, with soft shadows. Fresh, simple, natural beauty.",
