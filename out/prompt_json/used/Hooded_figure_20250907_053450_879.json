    "video_prompt": "Subtle glowing particles rise from the magical circles, the waves gently lap at the shore, the hooded figure's robe subtly billows, and the distant stars shimmer slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "Full shot: A dramatic and fantastical scene featuring a cloaked figure standing on a coastline at twilight or dawn. The figure is seen from behind, facing away, their hood obscuring their face. They are dressed in a dark, flowing robe with intricate gold trim at the hem and around the hood/neckline. The figure stands on the damp sand where the ocean waves meet the shore.\n\nIn front of the figure, leading out into the water, is a path of glowing, elaborate magical circles or runes. These mandalas are illuminated with warm, golden light, casting reflections on the wet sand and shallow water, and appear to float slightly above the surface. The circles radiate small, bright orbs of light. The ocean waves gently lap around the glowing circles and the dark rocks scattered along the shore.\n\nThe sky is a brilliant spectacle of streaking, golden light, resembling both a meteor shower and an aurora borealis. Countless bright, star-like streaks of light emanate from the horizon, converging towards the viewer, creating a sense of dynamic movement and cosmic energy. Some stars are exceptionally bright, appearing as prominent points of light with lens flares. The overall color palette of the sky ranges from deep oranges and golds near the horizon to darker blues and purples overhead, creating a gradient that emphasizes the magical light.\n\nIn the background, silhouetted by the brilliant sky, are tall, rugged mountains or large rock formations jutting out of the ocean. Some of these formations have sparse dark green vegetation on their peaks. The lighting is primarily from the celestial phenomenon, casting warm glows and creating strong contrast with the shadowed landscape and the figure. The overall atmosphere is ethereal, mystical, and awe-inspiring, suggesting a moment of powerful magic or a journey into the unknown.\n\nStyle: Fantasy art, digital painting, highly detailed, luminous, magical realism.\nComposition: Rule of thirds, leading lines (magical circles, celestial streaks), central focus on the figure.\nColors: Dominant warm golds, oranges, and yellows from the sky and magical circles, contrasted with deep blues, dark purples, and greens in the ocean, rocks, and figure's robe.\nLighting: Backlighting from the celestial phenomenon, strong rim lighting on the figure, reflective light from the magical circles.\nAtmosphere: Epic, mysterious, powerful, spiritual, awe-inspiring.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "* **Magical circles emit rising, shimmering particles.**\n* **Waves rhythmically advance and recede on the shore.**\n* **The hooded figure's robe softly undulates with an unseen breeze.**\n* **Distant stars minimally twinkle and fade.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Video Prompt: Chaos on the Arcane Coast**\n\nThe towering stars and mountains COLLAPSE and ERUPT with blinding light! The entire sky RIPS open as a maelstrom of glowing particles DETONATES, consumed by violent energy. The furious waves LASH and ROAR, DEVOURING the shore. The robed figure is THRASHED by an unseen force, their garment RAGGED and WHIPPING wildly. The arcane circles PULSATE with an alarming, erratic rhythm, then EXPLODE with a blinding surge, unleashing a torrent of destructive magic! Nothing is stationary, everything is in FLUX and CATASTROPHE!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "As waves spiral inward, forming luminous star-paths beneath the cloaked figure, the sea itself levitates as shimmering, inverted waterfalls. The mountains glow, their peaks dissolving into constellations, while the figure's robe unravels into stardust, seeding new galaxies. Magical circles pulsed inward, warping not only light but the fabric of reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Prompt:** A hooded figure stands before mystical glowing circles on a moonlit beach. The camera dramatically pans from the shimmering starry sky to reveal the figure, their robe rippling in the wind. As the waves crash around the glowing circles, the camera tracks forward, revealing intricate details of the runes, sparks of light rising and swirling around the figure's outstretched hand before abruptly cutting to black.",
