    "video_prompt": "Ethereal god rays dramatically stream down from a towering skylight, illuminating a colossal, circular library. Countless dust motes dance and swirl within the golden light, casting dynamic shadows across ancient, bookshelf-lined walls. In the foreground, two figures gaze upwards, their heads subtly tilting in deepening awe and contemplation as the vast, knowledge-filled space unfolds before them, bathed in shifting, mystical light.",
    "image_prompt": "A colossal, circular library with towering dark wood bookshelves lining its walls. From ground level, the bookshelves curve inwards, forming a tunnel towards a grand circular spoked skylight at the apex. Dramatic golden god rays (volumetric light) pierce the dusty air from above, creating a mystical atmosphere. In the lower foreground, two small figures, seen from behind, gaze upwards in awe. The dusty floor is scattered with ancient books and wooden crates. Epic, sublime, fantasy architecture."
