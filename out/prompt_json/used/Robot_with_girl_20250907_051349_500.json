    "video_prompt": "Subtle flicker in the lights of the distant city buildings. Soft, undulating glow from the robot's blue tubes. Minute shimmer in the golden accents of the robot and the girl's outfit. Gentle rise and fall of the girl's chest, implying breath. Scattered sparks near the robot's feet subtly dance and fade. Minimal camera drift, perhaps a slow, almost imperceptible zoom in or out. The large glowing cannon subtly pulsates with light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull-body shot of a young, stylish woman standing confidently in the open palm of a massive, intricately detailed humanoid mech. The woman wears a modern, sporty outfit: a black and white crop top, black shorts with gold trim, and a full-face white and gold helmet with a clear visor that reveals her eyes. The mech is predominantly dark metallic gray with intricate gold and bright light-blue glowing accents, hoses, and pistons, especially around its shoulders, arms, and weapon system. Its large, multi-barreled shoulder-mounted cannon fires a powerful beam of bright orange and gold energy upwards and to the right, creating dynamic sparks and light streaks in the air. The scene is set on a dark, wet, and slightly cracked urban street at night or dusk, with glowing embers and reflections scattering across the ground. In the background, brightly lit neon signs and building lights of a bustling cyberpunk city create a shallow depth of field, blurring into a vibrant, futuristic atmosphere. The lighting is dramatic, with bright light emanating from the mech's weapon and reflections off its metallic surfaces, contrasting with the muted city lights. The overall mood is powerful, futuristic, and action-oriented. Intricate details, cinematic lighting, photorealistic rendering.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Young woman (stylish, sporty outfit, full-face helmet with visor, confident pose).\n*   **Secondary Subject:** Humanoid mech (massive, intricate, dark metallic gray, gold/blue accents, hoses, pistons, multi-barreled shoulder cannon).\n*   **Action/Interaction:** Woman standing in mech's open palm. Mech firing energy beam with sparks/streaks.\n*   **Environment:** Urban street (dark, wet, cracked), cyberpunk city background (neon signs, building lights).\n*   **Atmosphere/Effects:** Dynamic sparks/embers, light reflections, energy beam, glowing accents.\n*   **Lighting:** Dramatic, bright light from weapon, contrasting with muted city lights, reflections.\n*   **Color Palette:** Dominantly dark grays/blacks, gold, bright light-blue, orange/gold (energy), neon multi-colors in background.\n*   **Composition:** Full-body shot, low angle, showing scale between woman and mech.\n*   **Style:** Cinematic, photorealistic, intricate detail, futuristic, action.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle city lights flicker, robot's blue tubes undulate softly. Robot and girl's golden accents shimmer. Girl's chest gently rises and falls. Sparks near robot's feet dance and fade. Minimal camera drift (zoom in/out). Cannon subtly pulsates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "City lights intensely flicker and surge! Robot's blue tubes pulse violently. Gold accents on robot and girl's outfit shimmer explosively. Girl's chest heaves erratically. Sparks ignite and erupt vividly around robot's feet. Camera quickly pans and zooms, capturing the chaotic energy. The cannon unleashes explosive bursts, illuminating the scene in blinding flashes!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robot and girl meld into shimmering liquid, then reform as luminous gaseous entities, floating upwards. City lights melt into a rainbow river flowing skyward. Sparks coalesce into fleeting constellations. The cannon's light contracts, reforming a miniature city, then implodes. Gravity inverts, pulling street chunks into the gaseous girl, then exploding into stars.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Dramatic Cinematic Prompt:**\n\nA slow, sweeping crane shot reveals the city's glittering skyline. We push in on the formidable robot, with its blue tubes gently pulsing brighter and the golden accents on it and the girl's outfit shimmering. The camera then swiftly tracks around the girl as she dramatically raises her armed hand; the cannon charges intensely, flickering with blinding light that casts dynamic shadows, before firing a powerful beam. The impact creates intense, scattered sparks that momentarily flash the cinematic scene before slowly fading.",
