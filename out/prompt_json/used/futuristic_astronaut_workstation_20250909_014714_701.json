    "video_prompt": "A subtle, slow pan of the camera from right to left, showing the astronaut typing on the keyboard. Outside the window, a gentle snowfall begins, adding soft, moving specks to the scene. The small flying vehicle outside subtly drifts and bobs in the air.",
    "image_prompt": "An astronaut in a red spacesuit, wearing a white helmet with a dark visor, sitting in a pilot's seat inside a futuristic spacecraft or control room. The astronaut is typing on a keyboard attached to a computer console on the left. Through a large, rounded window, a snowy, mountainous landscape is visible, featuring a large, orange and white futuristic base or facility. In the sky above the facility, a smaller, dark grey and orange flying vehicle with glowing blue lights hovers.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Astronaut:** Dressed in a detailed red spacesuit with quilted areas, grey accents, and a patch resembling the American flag on the right arm. White, spherical helmet with a dark reflective visor, featuring visible controls or sensors. Sitting upright in a grey, cushioned pilot's chair.\n*   **Interior:** The spacecraft/control room interior is grey and metallic with visible structural elements, pipes, and control panels. A bulky computer console on the left with a screen displaying blue graphics and a green light.\n*   **Exterior:**\n    *   **Landscape:** Vast, snow-covered ground with barren, pointed snow-capped mountains in the background. Hazy blue sky with faint cloud streaks.\n    *   **Structures:** A prominent, multi-level futuristic base, largely rectangular with orange and white sections, supported by pillars, and featuring circular antennas or sensors.\n    *   **Vehicle:** A distinct, dark grey and orange aerial vehicle, shaped somewhat like a rectangular blimp or transport, with numerous small blue lights underneath, hovering in the sky.\n\n**Style:**\nFuturistic, sci-fi, realistic with highly detailed textures and materials.\n\n**Composition:**\nRule of thirds roughly applies, with the astronaut's face and eyes slightly off-center to the left, and the main exterior base placed on the right vertical third. The large window dominates the upper two-thirds of the image, showcasing the intricate exterior scene. Shallow depth of field focusing on the astronaut and foreground elements, with the background slightly softened.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are cool blues of the sky and snow, contrasting with the warm reds of the astronaut's suit and the orange accents of the exterior base and flying vehicle. Greys of the interior and white of the mountains provide a neutral palette. Small pops of bright blue and green from lights.\n\n**Lighting:**\nBright, clear daylight emanating from the exterior, casting soft shadows. The interior is well-lit, with some ambient light possibly coming from the console screen. The overall lighting is crisp and clean, enhancing the futuristic feel.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nCalm, focused, and slightly awe-inspiring due to the vast, alien landscape and advanced technology. There's a sense of exploration and a futuristic frontier.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A slow, right-to-left camera pan reveals an astronaut's fingers typing. Outside the window, snow begins to fall, its specks drifting downwards. A small flying vehicle subtly bobs and drifts outside.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Boom! Camera explodes inward, then violently yanks left, flinging the astronaut and keyboard. Keys shatter, data glitches. Outside, the blizzard ignites, snow streaks into a roaring vortex, ripping at the mountain and the base. The hovering vehicle convulses, blasting off into the maelstrom, leaving a fiery trail. Buildings buckle, ice tremors, the world shatters with raw energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A dreamlike pan as the room slowly inverts, the astronaut's hands typing furiously on a keyboard of shifting liquid, their suit blossoming into iridescent feathers. Outside,  snowfall coalesces into upward-swirling galaxies, the flying vehicle dissolving and reforming as a kaleidoscope of impossible geometry, drifting ethereally through layers of time.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Tracking shot inside the cockpit, a slow, intimate curve around the astronaut as fingers tap the keyboard. Outside the panoramic window, a sudden, heavy snowfall blurs the distant base. The large flying vehicle outside dips dramatically, responding to the weather. The camera then subtly pulls back, revealing the astronaut’s isolated focus against the swirling storm.",
