    "video_prompt": "The robotic lobster gently sways from side to side, its antennae subtly twitching. The internal gears and pistons behind the white plating show slight, continuous movement. Minute light reflections shimmer on the glossy red and metallic surfaces, indicating a gentle play of light.",
    "image_prompt": "A striking, high-detail full-body shot of a vibrant red and metallic white robotic lobster, positioned standing upright against a soft, bright, light gray background. The robot features intricate mechanical detailing with exposed gears, wires, and pistons, especially visible underneath the segmented red exoskeleton. The red parts are glossy and reflective, contrasting with the smooth, matte white sections on its body. Its head has prominent black antennae and a sharp, serrated ridge. One large red claw is raised and articulated, showcasing its mechanical joints. The robot's multiple legs extend downwards with subtle articulation, and the tail is also distinctly segmented and mechanical. The overall lighting is bright and even, highlighting the metallic sheen and the robot's contours, with a subtle shadow beneath its tail, grounding the image. The composition is clean and focused, presenting the robot as a sophisticated piece of engineering art. Minimal text overlays are present: \"AI生成\" in the top left corner and \"C29\" as a stylized signature in the bottom right.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The robotic lobster gently sways, antennae subtly twitching. Internal gears and pistons continuously shift behind the white plating. Minute light reflections shimmer across its glossy red and metallic surfaces, constantly redefining its form.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The robotic lobster violently convulses, claws snapping, antennae whipping furiously. Its sleek red plating cracks, revealing a frenzied whirl of gears and pistons. Arcane lightning crackles, illuminating frantic movements across its body, then fuses into a blinding pulse that propels it aggressively forward. Shards of shimmering metal explode from its form, twisting into impossible, razor-sharp appendages.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robotic lobster's shimmering segments slowly unravel, revealing a cosmic nebula swirling within. Its antennae become intertwining celestial ribbons, pulling the lobster upwards as gravity inverts. Mechanical legs dissolve into stardust, which then coalesces into tiny, singing planets around a pulsating heart of pure light. The white plating shifts to iridescent scales that ripple with impossible colors, while time flows in reverse for the lobster, making it younger with each sway, until it's a glowing, embryonic form floating serenely in space.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in on the robotic lobster as it begins to sway, focusing on the antennae twitching. A sweeping crane shot reveals the intricate internal gears and pistons behind the plating, catching glints of light. The camera then tracks the lobster's controlled, deliberate movements, its glossy red shell subtly reflecting ambient light, building suspense with each sway.",
