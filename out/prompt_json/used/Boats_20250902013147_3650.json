  "video_prompt": "As dawn or dusk breaks, soft light shifts across a misty horizon where a faint structure gradually emerges. Water gently ripples, causing long, distorted reflections of dark, moored boats to subtly waver and sway. A solitary figure aboard one boat subtly shifts their gaze. Ethereal mist gently swirls, altering the distant background. Watercolor washes in the foreground fluidly blend and bleed, creating dynamic, abstract textures and transitioning colors on the water's surface.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from more detailed to very concise, depending on the model's desired level of instruction:\n\n---\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Structured):**\n\n```\nStunning minimalist watercolor painting, fluid and atmospheric. Vertical composition, strong emphasis on reflections and interplay of light and shadow. Dominant palette: warm ochre, burnt orange, deep indigo, charcoal grey, creamy off-white, applied in translucent washes.\n\nTop quarter: Soft, diffused warm orange/ochre sky (sunrise/sunset) with a misty cool grey-blue horizon. Faint, simple Asian pagoda with peaked roof emerges from mist on left.\n\nMid-ground: Dark, silhouetted boats (single-masted boat with solitary figure, larger central boat), and abstract clusters of buildings/docks in deep charcoal and indigo on the right, with ropes. All forms are simplified.\n\nWater: Luminous, creamy off-white surface with long, distorted reflections of boats/structures in lighter grey and indigo. Extensive horizontal lines for stillness, with dabs and splatters for texture/ripples.\n\nForeground (bottom quarter): Transitions to deeper, saturated blues and greys (almost black), with expressive abstract brushwork, large diffused washes, defined horizontal/vertical strokes, bleeding warm orange/ochre patches, and splatters.\n\nOverall: Tranquil, solitary, ethereal water-bound landscape of an ancient fishing village/harbor at dawn or dusk. Loose, expressive technique, emphasizing atmosphere over detail.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\n```\nMinimalist watercolor painting: vertical composition, strong reflections, light & shadow. Palette: warm ochre/burnt orange, deep indigo/charcoal grey, creamy off-white, in translucent washes.\n\nUpper sky: Soft orange/ochre sunrise/sunset, misty cool grey-blue horizon, faint Asian pagoda on left. Mid-ground: Dark, silhouetted boats (single-masted, solitary figure) and abstract deep indigo/charcoal buildings/docks.\n\nLuminous, creamy off-white water dominates, showing long, distorted reflections in lighter grey/indigo. Foreground transitions to deep blues/greys/black, with expressive abstract brushwork, splatters, and bleeding orange washes.\n\nTranquil, solitary, ethereal scene of an ancient fishing village or harbor at dawn/dusk, rendered with loose, atmospheric watercolor.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise - for models that infer well):**\n\n```\nMinimalist, atmospheric watercolor painting, vertical composition. Tranquil ancient fishing village/harbor at dawn or dusk. Dominant colors: warm ochre/burnt orange, deep indigo/charcoal grey, creamy off-white, applied in translucent washes. Soft orange/ochre sky, misty grey-blue horizon, faint Asian pagoda. Dark, silhouetted boats and abstract structures on luminous, reflective creamy off-white water with long, distorted grey/indigo reflections. Foreground water deepens to expressive blues/greys/black with splatters and orange bleeds.\n```",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Soft light dynamically shifts, revealing a structure gradually emerging from swirling mist. Water gently ripples, causing distorted boat reflections to waver and sway. A solitary figure subtly shifts their gaze. Ethereal mist swirls, actively altering the distant background. Foreground watercolor washes fluidly blend and bleed, creating dynamic, transitioning colors and abstract textures on the water's surface."
