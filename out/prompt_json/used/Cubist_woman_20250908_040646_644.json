    "video_prompt": "Subtle breath-like chest rising and falling. Eyelids slowly blink. Hair strands gently sway with an imperceptible breeze. The faint impression of light shimmering on the surface of the colorful shapes. A delicate, slow zoom out and a minute pan to the right.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided artwork:\n\n**Artwork Title/Subject:** Cubist Portrait of a Woman\n\n**Art Style:** Hard-edge Cubism with a Pop Art influence. The overall aesthetic is bold, geometric, and highly stylized, reminiscent of Picasso's later works blended with modern graphic design.\n\n**Composition:** A frontal waist-up portrait of a woman, symmetrically balanced despite the asymmetry of her facial features. The composition is entirely made of angular, geometric shapes, creating a fragmented yet cohesive image. The figure dominates the frame, set against a two-tone gray background.\n\n**Visual Elements (Detailed Breakdown):**\n\n*   **Subject:** A woman's face and upper torso, rendered in abstract, disconnected planes.\n*   **Face:**\n    *   **Overall:** Split vertically down the center. The left side (viewer's left) is predominantly bright yellow, while the right side (viewer's right) is light blue.\n    *   **Eyes:** Large, almond-shaped, and prominent. The whites of the eyes are bright white, with large black pupils. The left eye has a blue upper lid/brow area with a green highlight on the lower lid. The right eye has a teal upper lid/brow area with an orange highlight on the lower lid. Both eyes have thick black outlines.\n    *   **Nose:** Elongated, straight bridge, predominantly white with a small blue tip and black outline.\n    *   **Mouth:** Small, puckered red lips outlined in black, with a small white circular highlight below the lower lip, resembling a chin.\n    *   **Cheeks/Skin:**\n        *   Left cheek (viewer's left): Solid bright yellow.\n        *   Right cheek (viewer's right): Solid bright pink.\n    *   **Ears:** Stylized D-shapes. The left ear is light blue, the right ear is brown. Both outlined in black.\n*   **Hair:** Appears to frame the face like a geometric helmet, composed of multiple angular segments in red, yellow, and blue. Thick black outlines define all segments.\n*   **Body/Clothing:**\n    *   **Shoulders/Neck:** Right side (viewer's right) features a large light blue geometric plane, possibly part of a collar or shoulder. Below the chin, a small pink triangular segment.\n    *   **Lower down:** Features large, interlocking geometric shapes in red, black, yellow, orange, white, and various shades of blue and teal, suggesting clothing or the abstract interplay of light and shadow. The very bottom left is a large red triangular area.\n*   **Background:** Simplistic, flat, and divided into large rectangular planes of light gray and medium gray, some with subtle vertical line details (left side).\n\n**Colors:** Bold, saturated, and flat.\n*   **Dominant:** Bright Yellow, Red, Light Blue, Teal, Black.\n*   **Accents:** Pink, Orange, White, Brown, Green, various shades of Gray.\n*   **Palette Feel:** Primary and secondary colors, vibrant and high contrast.\n\n**Lighting:** Flat and even, typical of hard-edge illustration. There are no discernible shadows or light sources, contributing to the two-dimensional, graphic quality.\n\n**Atmosphere/Mood:** Energetic, modern, intellectual, and slightly enigmatic due to the fragmented nature of the face. It feels like a contemporary art piece with a strong historical art influence.\n\n**Texture:** The brushwork is visible, suggesting a painted medium (acrylics or oils) used with flat, even strokes typical of hard-edge painting. The outlines are crisp and thick, resembling ink or paint markers.\n\n**Signature/Markings:** \"c29\" in orange-gold, outlined in black, in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n\"A vibrant, high-contrast, hard-edge cubist portrait of a woman, featuring a split face with bright yellow on the viewer's left and light blue on the viewer's right. The eyes are large with black pupils, the left eye having a blue and green upper and lower lid area, the right eye having a teal and orange lid area. An elongated white nose with a blue tip and black outline. Small red lips with a bold black outline and a white circular 'chin' below. The left cheek is solid yellow, the right is bright pink. Stylized light blue and brown ears. The hair frames the face with angular segments in red, yellow, and blue. The body and clothing are an abstract arrangement of large geometric shapes in red, black, yellow, orange, pink, and various shades of blue and teal. All shapes are defined by thick, crisp black outlines. The background is a flat, two-tone gray with minimal geometric details. Vibrant, saturated colors. Flat, even lighting with no shadows. Visible brushstrokes giving a painterly texture. In the bottom right corner, a stylized 'c29' in orange-gold with a black outline.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle chest expansion/contraction. Slow, deliberate blinks. Gentle hair undulation. Faint light shimmer across shapes. Gradual, delicate zoom out with a slight right pan.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**The vibrant planes of color abruptly contort, shards of geometric forms explosively scattering across the frame. Eyes snap open, pupils dilating with fierce intensity, then rapidly narrow to slits. Hair whips violently as if caught in a sudden tempest. The light doesn't shimmer, it bursts forth in blinding flashes, pulsating with uncontrolled energy. The image doesn't just zoom and pan; it is violently ripped from its current position, spinning and tilting erratically before freezing with a jolt.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Subtle chest segments subtly separate, rotating on invisible axes before re-forming. Eyelids blink, each lash morphing into a tiny shimmering feather that dissolves. Hair strands, now geometric, float upward against gravity, then melt into liquid color, painting the background. Shapes subtly bleed into adjacent hues, then briefly become transparent, revealing hidden tessellations beneath. A slow, dizzying zoom out spirals outward as the entire canvas ripples like water, subtly shifting through impossible dimensions before snapping back into place with a quiet, shimmering *pop*.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A theatrical slow push-in, culminating in a dramatic close-up on the left eye as a subtle blink occurs. The camera then performs a graceful arc over the face towards the right ear, highlighting the angular shapes. As the camera pivots, a gentle light spill illuminates the entire artwork, revealing the intricate patterns. A near-imperceptible zoom out and pan to the right concludes the scene, leaving a sense of mystery and depth.",
