  "video_prompt": "A long-haired figure, possibly elven, gently dips bare feet into rippling water, creating subtle splashes. Their gaze shifts downward. A wispy, serpentine form, emitting energetic tendrils, moves through the dark twilight sky above. \n",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a vertical portrait painting of an ethereal maiden with long white hair and pale complexion, gazing at her bare feet splashing in water. She wears a flowing sheer white gown and sits on a mossy rock. The setting is twilight, with a dark blue sky, hints of orange/pink horizon, and a subtle, wispy, serpentine red/orange ghost-like figure in the upper left. The color palette emphasizes cool blues and greens with touches of white, pink, and orange. Style is high fantasy, realistic with a fantastical twist, soft lighting.",
