  "video_prompt": "An armored figure walks slowly, carrying a robotic mermaid. Blue lights on the carrier's helmet subtly pulsate. The mermaid's pale hair gently sways. Her delicate head fins and back fins subtly flutter. Glowing yellow code animates and scrolls across her metallic mermaid tail. She looks up, her serene expression gently shifting as her eyes blink. In the sterile, futuristic background, subtle shadows shift with their movement, and overhead lights softly hum.",
