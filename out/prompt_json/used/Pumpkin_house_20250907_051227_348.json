    "video_prompt": "A gentle sway of the pumpkin house, a subtle glimmer on its surface, and a slight flicker from the window lights. The miniature broccoli trees subtly rustle, while tiny ripples expand on the water where the miniature boats glide. The rowing figures exhibit a slight, rhythmic motion, and the small gravel path appears to shimmer faintly.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical, miniature village scene with a giant pumpkin acting as a cozy house, nestled amidst lush green moss. The pumpkin house has two arched windows with warm yellow light glowing from within, and a wooden arched door with a small, glowing lantern hanging by its side. A stone path leads away from the pumpkin house towards a calm, teal-colored pond.\n\nAround the pumpkin house and pond, a variety of colorful miniature vegetables are scattered, including red and orange pumpkins, red tomatoes, yellow cherry tomatoes, different colored onions (purple and white), and green broccoli trees in the background.\n\nTwo miniature figures in small wooden boats are rowing on the pond, one in the foreground fishing. The overall style is playful and enchanting, with soft, natural lighting that highlights the textures of the moss and vegetables. The composition is a close-up, eye-level shot, creating an immersive, almost diorama-like feel. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, and magical, evoking a sense of autumn and harvest.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The pumpkin house **sways gently** as a **subtle glimmer plays across its surface**, and **window lights flicker softly**. Miniature broccoli trees **rustle** while **tiny ripples expand on the water** where miniature boats **glide**. Rowing figures exhibit **slight, rhythmic motion**, and the small gravel path **shimmers faintly**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "PUMPKIN HOUSE EXPLODES! Windows shatter, glass shrapnel flies. Broccoli trees WHIP and lash, leaves shredding. Water churns into VIOLENT rapids, boats capsize, figures flail. Gravel path ERUPTS, stones launch into the air. EVERY STATIC OBJECT JERKS VIOLENTLY, RATTLES, AND SHAKES, POSSESSED BY UNSEEN FORCES. A cacophony of sound, a maelstrom of chaos!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The pumpkin house gently levitates, its windows winking out of existence as light pours *into* them, drawing the figures from the boats which then turn to mist. The broccoli trees unravel, becoming a green river that flows *up* into the sky. Ripples reverse, sucking light from the water as the boats transmute into glowing fish, swimming through the air. The gravel path pulses, rearranging into impossible geometric patterns.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic slow zoom on the glowing windows of the pumpkin house, as the entire scene gently sways, hinting at a hidden magical energy. A sudden, sharp pan follows the mini boats as they race with intense urgency, their oars synchronously striking the water, sending dramatic ripples across the pond. The broccoli trees subtly, yet rapidly, pulsate, while the gravel path appears to shimmer with an increasing intensity, as if hinting at a grand reveal.",
