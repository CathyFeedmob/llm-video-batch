    "video_prompt": "Subtle steam rising from the spoon; water flowing from the spoon into the bowl, creating ripples; goldfish swimming in the bowl; subtle shimmering on the water surface in the bowl; gentle swaying of the lotus flowers in the bowl; leaves on the miniature trees slightly trembling.",
    "image_prompt": "A surrealistic masterpiece showcasing a miniature, detailed Chinese landscape pouring from a ceramic spoon into a large, textured pot.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Top (Spoon):** A white ceramic spoon, held by a hand at the upper right, contains a vibrant miniature landscape. This landscape features two rocky mountains covered in lush green miniature trees and bushes. A waterfall cascades from the rightmost mountain into a serene turquoise pool that fills the spoon. On the left side of the spoon's landscape, a small, intricate Chinese pavilion with a dark roof and red accents is nestled among the greenery. Wisps of white smoke rise from the spoon.\n*   **Bottom (Pot):** Below the spoon, a large, round ceramic pot with a mottled teal and brown glaze acts as the receiving basin. The turquoise water from the spoon pours into the center of the pot, creating ripples and small splashes. The pot's water also contains two additional miniature Chinese pavilions (one with a bridge leading up to it), several pink water lilies with green pads, and a group of small orange goldfish swimming.\n*   **Background:** A soft, blurred earth-toned background with hints of green foliage on the left and a soft pink lotus flower on the right, suggesting a serene indoor or natural setting.\n\n**Style:**\nSurreal, highly detailed miniature photography, dreamlike, tranquil, artistic. The textures are realistic despite the miniature scale.\n\n**Composition:**\nDynamic vertical flow from the spoon to the pot. The spoon is held at an angle, directing the waterfall downwards. The composition uses depth of field to keep the miniature landscapes in sharp focus while blurring the background. The \"c29\" watermark is in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Colors:**\n Dominant turquoise for water, lush greens for foliage, earthy browns and grays for rocks and background. Accents of red on pavilions, pink on water lilies, and bright orange for goldfish. White for the spoon and smoke wisps.\n\n**Lighting:**\nSoft, natural, even lighting that highlights the textures and details of the miniature elements, creating gentle reflections on the water and ceramic surfaces.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nPeaceful, meditative, magical, and whimsical, evoking a sense of calm and wonder.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nSteam gently unfurls from the spoon, its contents cascading into the bowl, generating expanding ripples. A goldfish gracefully navigates the water, its scales catching the ethereal shimmer on the surface. Lotus blossoms delicately sway, accompanied by the subtle tremble of miniature tree leaves.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent gales whip steam from the spoon, transforming into a swirling vortex that violently pulls water upwards from the bowl. The miniature landscape on the spoon shatters, releasing torrents of water that explosively erupt into the bowl. Goldfish writhe erratically, launching themselves into a chaotic aerial ballet. Lotus flowers rapidly bloom and burst apart, sending petals flying in a furious storm. Trees on the miniature mountains thrash wildly, their leaves shredding as the entire scene contorts into a liquid maelstrom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "From the spoon, a torrent of iridescent water defies gravity, flowing upwards and coalescing into ethereal clouds. The miniature floating landscapes within the bowl pulsate with an inner light, their trees unfurling impossible, glowing flora. Goldfish made of pure light swim backward through the shimmering water, leaving trails of stardust. Lotus flowers bloom and un-bloom in a silent, cosmic dance, while the entire bowl slowly rotates through shifting, impossible dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Dramatic Cinematic Sequence: \"Harmony's Descent\"**\n\nCamera slowly pulls back from a close-up of intricate steam swirling upward from the spoon's miniature landscape. A sudden, deep rumbling, as the spoon dramatically tips, water cascades into the tranquil bowl below. The camera aggressively crash-zooms into the splashing impact, water erupting and rippling outward. Goldfish darting frantically. As the water settles, sunlight glints across the surface, reflecting a distant, unseen explosion. Lotus flowers unfurl, trembling slightly. The camera then gracefully swoops up and over the scene, revealing the vast, serene environment now transformed.",
