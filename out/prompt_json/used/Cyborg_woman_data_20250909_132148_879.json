    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A futuristic, elegant female android or cyborg, depicted from the mid-torso up, in a profile view looking rightward. She has long, flowing white hair that cascades over her left shoulder. Her skin is a bright, smooth, porcelain-like white, subtly revealing intricate, glowing golden circuit patterns beneath the surface, particularly around her neck and temples. Golden, metallic elements seamlessly integrate into her form, especially around her chest, appearing as flowing, almost liquid-like armor or ornate garment. Small, fragmented golden electronic components and shimmering translucent shards of glass or crystal appear to be detaching or floating around her head and shoulders, as if she is emanating or interacting with data.\n\n**Background:** A dark, empty void or deep black space.\n\n**Elements:** Scattered, glowing gold and white alphanumeric characters (like \"I\", \"M\", \"1\", \"2l\", \"S\", \"D\", \"0\", \"SIMO 10DI\", \"TO 5\") are suspended throughout the dark background, appearing as if they are digital data or code fragments. Some characters are sharp and clear, others are slightly blurred or fragmented.\n\n**Lighting:** High-contrast, dramatic lighting. A strong, ethereal light source illuminates the android from the left, highlighting her features and metallic accents. The background elements glow with their own subtle internal light.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are stark white, brilliant gold, and deep black. Minimal use of dark silver/grey for certain metallic details.\n\n**Style:** Cyberpunk, sci-fi, surreal, highly detailed, photorealistic with a painterly blend. Emphasize intricate circuitry, reflective surfaces, and glowing elements. The overall aesthetic should be one of advanced technology and ethereal beauty.\n\n**Composition:** Vertical orientation. The android occupies the lower middle and right side of the frame, her gaze directed right. The floating data elements fill the upper and left portions of the background, creating depth and a sense of dynamic energy. The composition should convey isolation yet also profound connection to digital information.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Mysterious, intelligent, advanced, slightly melancholic, and awe-inspiring.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer on gold accents, floating data fragments slowly drift, hair gently sways, faint glow pulses from embedded circuits.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Gold circuits erupt with blinding flashes, showering fragmented data that violently rips through the air. Hair whips into a maelstrom, while embedded circuits pulsate with uncontrolled, explosive energy. Bits of \"SIMO 10DI\" and other numbers spin and collapse, devoured by the chaotic shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity inverts, gold fragments defyingly coalesce, blooming into iridescent butterflies that shimmer, then become liquid, flowing back into the circuits of the figure. Her hair, a cascading river of light, flows upward, weaving impossible patterns, while data streams materialize from her gaze, forming ephemeral galaxies that spin and collapse into pure golden light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Dramatic Cybernetic Awakening.** A wide shot reveals the humanoid, data fragments exploding around her. A swift zoom-in to her serene face as gold circuits on her skin glow, pulsating subtly. Then, a sweeping crane shot as her long, white hair flows around her, catching the faint glint of drifting data. As the camera circles, a single gold data fragment, seemingly drawn to her, drifts and embeds itself into her forehead, causing a final, bright pulse of light.",
