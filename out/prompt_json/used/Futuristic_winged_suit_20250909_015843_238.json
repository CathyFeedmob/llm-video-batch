    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Core Concept:** A full-body shot of a sleek, futuristic cybernetic woman with large, mechanical wings, standing in a dark, dystopian cityscape, illuminated by striking red and white glowing elements.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** A slender, athletic humanoid female with a porcelain-like face, wearing a form-fitting, glossy black cybernetic suit.\n    *   **Head:** Dark, short, straight hair, a highly stylized black visor covering her eyes, and integrated futuristic headphones/headset. Her visible face is exquisitely detailed, with delicate features and a serious expression.\n    *   **Body Suit:** Polished, reflective black material, resembling latex or a high-tech polymer. It features intricate, subtle biomechanical detailing and panel lines, creating a segmented yet smooth appearance. There are faint glowing red details on the joints (knees, elbows) and scattered across the suit.\n    *   **Hands/Feet:** Gloved hands with visible segmented joints, and sleek, high-heeled cybernetic boots.\n    *   **Wings:** Large, prominent, elaborate mechanical wings extending from her back. They are primarily black and metallic, with significant glowing red light strips and occasional vertical white light accents (like two parallel lines on the underside). The wings have a sharp, angular, almost bat-like or stealth-fighter aesthetic, with complex internal mechanisms visible in parts.\n*   **Environment:** A futuristic, dystopian city street or alley at night.\n    *   **Ground:** Dark, wet-looking, reflective ground with subtle puddles and scattered debris or industrial elements. The ground reflects the red light from the wings and building lights.\n    *   **Background:** Tall, dark, monolithic skyscraper-like structures or industrial buildings, dimly lit with sparse, distant red or amber lights. The distant city appears hazy and imposing, hinting at a vast, grimy urban landscape. The overall feel is one of imposing, cold architecture.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Art Style:** Hyperrealistic, photorealistic, with a strong emphasis on sci-fi and cyberpunk aesthetics.\n*   **Genre:** Cyberpunk, Mecha, Sci-fi, Dark Fantasy elements subtly.\n*   **Influences:** Blend of high-fashion futurism and gritty technological decay.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Perspective:** Full-body shot, low-angle perspective, making the subject appear powerful and imposing.\n*   **Framing:** Centralized subject, with ample space above and around to emphasize the scale of the wings and the surrounding environment.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** Subject generally aligns with the central vertical third, with the wings filling the outer thirds.\n*   **Depth of Field:** Shallow to moderate, with the subject sharply in focus and the background subtly blurred to emphasize her presence.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Palette:** Primarily monochromatic (black, dark grays, obsidian) with striking accents of bright, intense red and subtle white.\n*   **Red:** Used for glowing elements on the suit, wings, and distant city lights, providing a stark contrast and a sense of danger or energy.\n*   **White:** Minimal, used for specific glowing lines on the wings and distant background highlights, providing a cool contrast to the red.\n*   **Reflections:** The reflective surfaces of the suit and ground pick up the red and subtle blue/gray ambient light.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Key Light:** Dramatic, directional lighting from above and slightly in front, highlighting the sheen of the suit and the contours of the wings.\n*   **Fill Light:** Subtle ambient light that allows details in the darker areas to be seen without losing the overall somber mood.\n*   **Glows/Emissive:** Strong emphasis on emissive red (and some white) lights from the suit and wings, which cast a vibrant glow onto surrounding surfaces and create internal reflections.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Dark, moody, high contrast, with a sense of artificial illumination in a dim environment.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Mysterious, powerful, ominous, elegant, and technologically advanced.\n*   **Feeling:** A blend of future noir and high-tech elegance. Isolated and commanding.\n\n---\n\n**Concise Prompt for Image Generation:**\n\n**\"Full body shot, hyperrealistic render of a sleek cybernetic woman in a glossy black advanced combat suit with elaborate mechanical wings. She stands centrally on a wet, reflective dark futuristic street. The suit and wings feature intricate biomechanical details and prominent glowing red light strips, with subtle white light accents on the wings. Her face is human with a dark, stylized visor and futuristic headset. Low-angle perspective. The background is a dark, towering dystopian cityscape with sparse, distant red lights, creating a high-contrast, moody, and ominous atmosphere. Cinematic lighting, dramatic shadows, vibrant red and white glows, reflection.\"**",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few options, focusing on movement, changes, and expression:\n\n**Option 1 (Concise & Focused):**\nRed lights on suit and wings subtly glow and flicker. Suit's reflective sheen shifts with simulated light source. Camera pans gently left-to-right. Distant background exhibits slight heat shimmer.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Descriptive Movement):**\nDynamic, subtle glow and flicker emanates from suit and wing lights. Suit's reflective surfaces ripple and shift with a moving simulated light source. Camera glides in a shallow left-to-right pan. Distant background shimmers and distorts with heat.\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasizing Organic Shift):**\nRed lights on suit and wings pulsate and dim. Suit's reflective sheen fluidly warps with a simulated moving light source. Camera smoothly tracks left-to-right. Background subtly hallucinates with heat shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive energy surges: Wings violently unfurl, red lights flare, suit's sheen ripples like disturbed liquid. Camera violently jerks, a dizzying whirlwind of motion revealing chaotic street architecture warping and dissolving. Distant buildings shimmer and buckle, their forms writhing as unseen forces tear at reality. Ground cracks and erupts, sending debris flying.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Crimson veins of light on the suit pulse and expand, revealing liquid metal that flows upwards, reforming the wings into spiraling vortexes of pure energy. Gravity inverts, pulling molten light from the ground, weaving itself into the suit's surface as everything else ascends into a sky shattering into crystalline shards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A chilling fog rolls through a desolate, futuristic city. A subtle glow emanates from the red lights on the cybernetic suit, reflecting on the polished components. The camera slowly pans left, revealing the full imposing figure of the entity. Suddenly, the suit's red lights intensify, pulsing with a vibrant, almost menacing rhythm. With a graceful, sweeping motion, the entity's metallic wings slowly articulate, unfolding to their full, impressive span. As the camera dramatically zooms out, the city lights flicker and die, plunging the scene into an eerie, foreboding darkness, punctuated only by the entity's glowing suit.",
