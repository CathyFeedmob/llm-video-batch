    "video_prompt": "A woman standing in water, holding a glowing ember, with autumnal trees surrounding her.\n\n**Subtle movements:**\n* The woman's hair gently sways and some strands float near her face.\n* The embers held in her hand flicker and glow softly, emitting tiny sparks that rise into the air.\n* Leaves subtly fall from the trees and float down towards the water, and a couple gently drift on the water's surface.\n* The water around the woman ripples outwards from her body, reflecting the warm glow of the ember and the autumnal leaves.\nThe light from the ember casts a soft, dynamic glow on her face and the surrounding water.\n* The camera slowly zooms in, emphasizing the subtle movement of details around the woman.",
    "image_prompt": "A woman standing in a serene river at dusk, holding a glowing firefly. The woman is viewed from a slight side angle, looking down at the firefly. Her hair is loosely tied up, and she wears a simple dress that gets wet in the water. The river water is calm with gentle ripples around her.\n\nThe scene is set in an autumn forest, with vibrant orange and red leaves on the trees that line the riverbanks. Some autumn leaves are floating on the water's surface. The sky is a deep teal or turquoise, transitioning to darker shades as it meets the horizon.\n\n**Composition:** Full body shot, portrait orientation, the woman is slightly off-center to the right, balancing the tree on the left. The water takes up the lower half of the image, reflecting the warm fall colors and sky.\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are rich teals/blues for the sky and water, contrasting with vivid oranges and reds for the leaves and the firefly's light. Warm glow from the firefly and reflections.\n**Lighting:** Soft, ambient light from the dusk sky, complemented by the strong, warm glow emanating from the firefly, casting reflections on the water and softly illuminating the woman's face and arm.\n**Atmosphere:** Tranquil, magical, and contemplative.\n**Style:** Stylized illustration with painterly textures, reminiscent of digital art or anime, with a focus on color and light contrast.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "* The woman's hair subtly drifts, embers softly pulse with rising sparks, and leaves gently descend, landing on the rippling water. The ember casts a dynamic, expanding glow. The camera subtly pushes in on her.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The woman twists violently, her hair thrashing like a storm. The ember explodes into a roaring inferno, blasting leaves from the trees. Trees rupture, branches clawing at the sky. The river erupts, geysers of water consuming the woman. The camera rips into the chaotic scene, light from the blaze consuming everything in a blinding, infernal flash.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A woman stands in water, her form shimmering as her hair, a constellation of falling leaves, reverses its ascent, coalescing into her head. The ember in her hand, a living flame, pulses, drawing surrounding water into luminous, crystalline vines that coil around her. Ripples become solid rings, levitating and dissolving into glowing dust, while tree branches bend inwards, swallowing their own autumnal leaves, re-sprouting them as blossoming fire. Colors bleed, shifting from warm to cool, then back again, like a dream fading and reforming.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic and Dramatic Video Prompt:**\n\nOpening on a wide, sweeping shot, the camera glides through autumnal trees, revealing a woman standing waist-deep in mystical waters. A dramatic, slow zoom closes in as her hand rises, clutching a smoldering, fiery ember. As sparks erupt, a sudden, powerful ripple expands outwards, distorting the ember's reflection. The woman's head slowly turns, eyes locking onto an unseen element, as an unexpected gust of wind whips her hair and scattered leaves into a furious, swirling dance. The ember glows intensely, momentarily illuminating hidden depths in the water.",
