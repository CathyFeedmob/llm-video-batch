A few cats and dogs around the house subtly twitch their ears or tails. The house windows subtly flicker as if lights are turning on/off. The cats and dogs outside the pepper subtly shift their weight or glance around.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photorealistic image of a vibrant red bell pepper, cut in half vertically to reveal its interior. The inside of the pepper functions as a miniature diorama or miniature world.\n\n**Composition & Elements:**\n*   **Bell Pepper:** The dominant element, perfectly bisected with visible inner red flesh and white pith, and a cluster of light beige seeds hanging from the top. The green stem is intact at the very top.\n*   **Miniature World:** Inside the pepper, there's a miniature landscape with lush green grass, a winding grey road, a small, illuminated white house with blue shutters and a grey roof, and a tiny green pine tree. The house has warm yellow light emanating from its windows and front door.\n*   **Miniature Animals:** Several miniature-sized cats and a few dogs are scattered across the grassy areas inside the pepper and on the white surface outside the pepper. They are in various poses, some walking, some standing. The animals are tiny, appearing as if they are figurines.\n*   **Road & Car:** A light blue miniature car is parked or driving on the grey road inside the pepper, near the house.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Lighting:** Bright, soft, and even studio lighting. There are subtle reflections on the white surface below the pepper and a soft highlight on the pepper's skin. The interior of the house is illuminated from within, creating a warm glow.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Whimsical, surreal, clean, and dreamlike. The image evokes a sense of miniature scale and a hidden world.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Colors:** Rich red of the pepper, vibrant green of the stem and grass, bright white of the seeds and house, and subtle blues and greys.\n*   **Accents:** Warm yellow from the house lights, various shades of brown, grey, and cream for the miniature animals.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Photorealistic:** Extremely detailed and realistic, as if a real bell pepper was meticulously crafted into this scene.\n*   **Conceptual Art:** Blends the ordinary (bell pepper) with an extraordinary, imaginative concept (miniature world).\n*   **Still Life:** Possesses the quality of a carefully arranged still life.\n\n**Technical Aspects:**\n*   **Depth of Field:** Relatively shallow depth of field, with the focus sharp on the pepper's interior and the miniature elements, and a slight softening towards the background and foreground.\n*   **Background:** Clean, plain, light grey or off-white studio background that emphasizes the subject.\n*   **Reflections:** Subtle reflections of the pepper and some miniature animals on the glossy white surface below.\n\n**Overall Impression:** A highly creative and visually striking image that combines food photography with miniature scene design, showcasing a \"home sweet home\" concept within an unexpected edible environment.",

    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The sliced pepper halves slowly stretch and melt, merging into an ethereal red liquid that drips upwards into the ceiling. The house inside shrinks and expands erratically, its windows blinking with impossible light colors. The cats and dogs within merge into a single, multi-limbed creature that dances on air, while the car multiplies and dissolves into shimmering dust. Outside, the loose pets inflate like balloons, bobbing weightlessly before exploding into colorful confetti. The \"C29\" logo shimmers, distorting into an indecipherable symbol.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly tracks back, revealing the immense white space surrounding the colossal pepper. Within, the miniature blue car embarks on its winding journey, its headlights subtly flickering.
