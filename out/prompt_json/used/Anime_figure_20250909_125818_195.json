    "video_prompt": "A slight shimmer and subtle undulation through the character's white hair. Gentle, almost imperceptible blinks from the character's red eyes. The black ribbons in her hair sway softly. A very subtle glow pulses around the hole in the monitor. The light on the mouse subtly fades in and out.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA stylized 3D render of a chibi-style character breaking through a monitor screen. The character has white curly hair tied in pigtails with black bows, red eyes, and delicate facial features. She wears a black and red outfit with a sleeveless top, shorts, and armored armbands. One hand is reaching out from the screen, holding a computer mouse with a light blue glowing stripe. The background inside the monitor displays a dark blue user interface with various icons and windows. The monitor itself is a modern, flat-panel design, set on a white desktop. A grey keyboard with square keys is visible in the foreground. The lighting is bright and evenly diffused, highlighting the character's smooth, almost plastic-like texture. The overall composition is dynamic, with the character angled towards the viewer, creating a sense of immersion and playful interaction between the digital and physical worlds. The atmosphere is energetic and fun.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Style:** Stylized 3D render, chibi, cute, playful.\n*   **Characters:** One chibi-style character.\n    *   **Appearance:** White curly hair, pigtails with black bows, black hair clips on bangs.\n    *   **Face:** Red eyes, slight blush, small nose and mouth, detailed eyelashes.\n    *   **Attire:** Black sleeveless top with red emblem, black shorts, black armbands with grey buckles, black and red striped socks, black and grey boots.\n    *   **Accessories:** Silver ring on left hand, black choker with red charm, earrings (one hoop, one key-shaped).\n*   **Setting:**\n    *   **Monitor:** Modern flat-panel monitor, dark grey bezel, black screen displaying a dark blue user interface.\n    *   **User Interface (inside screen):** Dark blue background, visible icons (VLC player?), windows, and menu elements.\n    *   **Desktop:** Clean, white surface.\n    *   **Peripherals:** Grey computer mouse with light blue glowing stripe (held by character), grey keyboard with square keys (partially visible in foreground), black mouse pad (partially visible), black cable connecting to a smaller grey mouse on the right side.\n*   **Action/Composition:** Character breaking through the screen with a shattered glass effect around her, holding the mouse.

    "refined_video_prompt": "* **Character:** White hair shimmers and undulates, red eyes gently, almost imperceptibly blink. Black hair ribbons sway softly.\n* **Environment:** A subtle glow pulses around the monitor's hole. The mouse light subtly fades in and out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The character's white hair violently whips and spirals, creating a vortex. Her red eyes abruptly flash with blinding intensity. The black ribbons snap and lash around her head. The hole in the monitor explodes outwards with a burst of jagged glass and pulsing electric arcs. The mouse rockets back and forth across the desk.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The character's white hair, now a living cloud, writhes and reshapes into ephemeral creatures. Her red eyes, disembodied, orbit the screen like miniature suns, their blinks triggering cosmic ripples across the background. Black ribbons, elongated and serpentine, weave impossible patterns, coiling around floating keyboard keys that transform into musical notes. The mouse, a pulsating, crystalline heart, slowly melts into a shimmering liquid that defies gravity, flowing upwards and reforming the hole in the monitor into a black hole devouring the cosmic ripples.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, starting on a close-up of the character's subtly undulating white hair and softly swaying black ribbons, dramatically pulls back to reveal her red eyes gently blinking, and a subtle glow pulsing around the shattered monitor hole. As her hand reaches for the mouse, the camera swiftly tracks, focusing on the ring on her finger. A final, slow, theatrical zoom-out reveals the entire scene, ending with the mouse's light subtly fading in and out, emphasizing the character's focused intent.",
