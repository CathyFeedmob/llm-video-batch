    "video_prompt": "A subtle, gentle sway of her long dark hair. Slight rise and fall of her chest, indicating breathing. Minimal light play on the shiny leather and her skin, suggesting movement from ambient light. A soft flicker of the red light behind her.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on recreating its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**(Visual Elements):**\nA beautiful East Asian woman, young and slender, with striking pale skin, soft features, and long, straight, dark almost black hair styled with a subtle wave and side parting creating volume. She has delicate eyebrows, slight shadow around her eyes, and natural, full lips with a hint of color. She wears a simple, form-fitting, white short-sleeved crop top that exposes her toned midriff and navel. She also wears tight-fitting black leather pants and long, sleek black leather gloves that extend past her elbows.\n\n**(Style):**\nRealistic, cinematic portrait, detailed, high-resolution, contemporary fashion,\nurban aesthetic.\n\n**(Composition):**\nFull-body portrait, captured from her upper thighs up, leaning back against a wall. Her body is angled slightly to the left, with her head turned towards the viewer, making direct eye contact. One arm is subtly bent, with her hand resting inside her pocket, while the other arm is slightly lower. Her left knee is bent forward and slightly outwards. The background features a distressed concrete or brick wall, covered in abstract black and red graffiti and splatters reminiscent of street art. The overall composition emphasizes her figure and the urban setting.\n\n**(Colors):**\nDominant colors are monochromatic (black, white, various shades of gray) with strong, vibrant accents of dark red, particularly from the graffiti and a red light source. The woman's skin displays cool undertones.\n\n**(Lighting):**\nDramatic, moody lighting with a strong, directional red light source illuminating her right side and the wall behind her, creating deep shadows and highlights that emphasize the textures of her clothing (leather's sheen, fabric's softness) and her skin. There's also softer, cooler ambient light illuminating her face from the front left. The contrast between light and shadow is high, adding depth and intensity.\n\n**(Atmosphere):**\nIntriguing, confident, edgy, cool, urban, slightly mysterious, and calm.\n\n**(Negative Prompts):**\nText, easynegative, bad quality, low resolution, poorly drawn hands, deformed, disfigured, blurry, worst quality, monochrome, sepia, oversaturated, cartoon, anime, 3D render, vibrant, colorful background, blurry, out of frame, extra limbs, bad anatomy.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Her long, dark hair gently sways. Her chest subtly rises and falls with each breath. Light softly shifts across her shiny leather and skin. The red light behind her gently flickers.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her long dark hair whips violently, each strand lashing. Her chest heaves with fierce, ragged breaths. Jagged shards of light pierce through the air, glinting off the impossibly taut leather and her skin as if struck by an unseen explosion. The red light behind her pulses erratically, swirling into an inferno. The very walls crack and buckle around her, threatening to collapse as unseen forces rage.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her hair, a cascade of starry nebulae, defies gravity, swirling into a black hole that pulls the glossy leather into a shimmering liquid. Her skin, now bioluminescent, pulses with the spectral red light, which melts reality into flowing fractals. The world warps, a symphony of impossible morphs and paradoxical motions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow push-in revealing a subtle, gentle sway of her long dark hair. A whisper of wind causes her white crop top to subtly cling, highlighting the slight rise and fall of her chest. The camera then arc-shots to her hands, catching the minimal light play on her shiny leather gloves. Finally, a dramatic zoom out as the red glow intensifies, casting harsh shadows and revealing the graffiti in stark relief.",
