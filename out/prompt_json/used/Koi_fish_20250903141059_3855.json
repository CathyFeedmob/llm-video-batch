  "image_prompt": "A vibrant, multi-colored fish with a flowing tail, in traditional East Asian ink wash style. The dark fish body has subtle blue-grey scales and a striking eye. Its large, elaborate tail unfurls in blues, aquas, and hints of beige, with delicate, flowing strokes. The monochrome background is composed of expressive grey and black ink wash strokes, with sparse, abstract calligraphic lines resembling branches or rain. The overall image evokes tranquil elegance and fluid motion, blending realistic detail with abstract expression.",
