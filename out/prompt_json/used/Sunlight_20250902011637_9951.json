  "video_prompt": "A brilliant, golden light source at the tunnel's end pulses and flares intensely, radiating dynamic rays of warm light outwards. Shimmering, sparkling points of light glint and dance along the receding path. Golden dust motes gently drift and swirl through the air, catching the light. The hazy, dark teal sky slowly shifts above as the central light continuously intensifies and softens, creating a sense of ongoing, powerful revelation.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\nA dramatic, low-angle shot looking up a V-shaped tunnel, dominated by an intense, brilliant golden light source at the central midground. It flares into a powerful golden starburst with numerous radiating rays, featuring a white-hot core. Two dark, parallel structures with textured horizontal ridges frame the light, receding dramatically into the distance. Their inner surfaces are brilliantly illuminated, shimmering with countless sparkling points of light and soft golden bokeh circles. Deep shadows contrast sharply with the light. Above, a somber, hazy dark teal sky, with faint silhouettes of bare trees on the crests. Strong lens flare and scattered golden dust motes enhance the ethereal, magical, and hopeful atmosphere. Cinematic, high detail, volumetric lighting.",
