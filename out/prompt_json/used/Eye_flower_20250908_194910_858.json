    "video_prompt": "Gentle sway of the giant lotus flower, with subtle shimmering of the golden eye. Waterfalls softly cascade, their gleam subtly pulsing. The river below gently ripples. Birds occasionally flutter their wings or shift on their perches. A faint breeze rustles leaves and petals. Subtle camera pan upwards.",
    "image_prompt": "A fantastical lush forest scene dominated by giant trees with intricate bark and moss, acting as natural cliffs. Cascading waterfalls of varying widths and colors (some pure white, others glowing bluish-purple) descend from high above, creating a mystical atmosphere. At the very top, a massive, vibrant pink and orange lotus flower with a detailed, realistic human eye at its center serves as a surreal focal point. This \"eye\" is a striking blue-purple, with golden metallic detailing around the iris, giving it an otherworldly appearance.\n\nThroughout the scene, realistic, vividly colored birds with varied plumage (some brown and grey, others yellow and orange) are perched on branches or in flight, adding life to the magical setting. The forest floor and cliff sides are adorned with an abundance of large, blooming flowers in shades of pink, orange, and coral, featuring intricate petals that unfurl beautifully. Lush green foliage and moss cover the entire landscape.\n\nThe waterfalls flow into a serene, bright turquoise river or stream that winds through the bottom of the scene, reflecting the sky and the glowing waterfalls. The overall lighting is ethereal and bright, with a soft, magical glow emanating from the waterfalls and possibly the eye itself. The composition is vertical, emphasizing the height of the trees and waterfalls, with a deep sense of a hidden, enchanting world.\n\n**Detailed Prompt:**\n\n\"A surreal, magical forest scene. Giant, ancient tree trunks covered in moss and intricate bark form towering cliffs, with multiple vibrant waterfalls cascading down. The waterfalls vary in color, some pure white, others glowing with ethereal bluish-purple light, converging into a luminous turquoise river at the bottom. Majestic pink and orange lotus flowers with intricate petals bloom throughout the scene, clinging to the tree cliffs and riverbanks. One colossal lotus flower dominates the upper center, featuring a hyper-realistic human eye with a striking blue-purple iris and intricate golden embellishments. Diverse, vividly colored birds (brown, grey, yellow, orange) are perched on branches or in elegant flight between the trees. The atmosphere is mystical and enchanting, with soft, glowing light illuminating the entire scene. Vertical composition, fantastical realism, highly detailed, vibrant colors.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Giant lotus sways gently, its golden eye subtly shimmers. Waterfalls softly cascade and pulse. The river below gently ripples. Birds flutter wings and shift on perches. Leaves and petals rustle with a faint breeze. Camera pans subtly upwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Giant lotus abruptly pulsates, its golden eye violently expanding, contracting. Waterfalls surge, then reverse, gushing upwards with blinding light. The river below transforms into a furious torrent, then erupts. Birds launch themselves, streaking and diving with explosive force. Trees thrash, tearing at their roots. Petals detach, swirling into a chaotic vortex. Camera violently zooms and tilts, mimicking the furious chaos.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The giant lotus-eye slowly blinks, its golden iris dissolving into a nebula as petals fold inward then reverse, revealing cosmic dust. Waterfalls flow upward, then pause, solidifying into crystal before shattering into shimmering birds. The river shimmers backward, transforming into liquid light. Trees bend to new dimensions, birthing impossible blooms. Distant echoes of a forgotten melody warp reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pushes in on the shimmering golden eye within the gently swaying lotus, its irises pulsing with an ethereal glow. A single bird gracefully soars away from its perch. Then, a sweeping crane shot begins, rising past cascading, subtly pulsing waterfalls to reveal the vast, luminous river below, whose ripples intensify with each upward surge, as a sudden gust of wind creates a swirling vortex of petals.",
