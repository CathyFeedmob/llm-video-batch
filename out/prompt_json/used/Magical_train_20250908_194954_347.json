    "video_prompt": "The stars subtly twinkle in the night sky. Wispy sections of the clouds slowly drift and shift, with golden embers faintly sparkling within them. The smoke billowing from the train's smokestack gently expands and dissipates upwards, with a soft glow emanating from its base. The golden light outlining the train and tracks subtly pulses and flickers. Fine particles of light occasionally sparkle and float up from the glowing tracks. The lights on the castle shimmer and glow softly.",
    "image_prompt": "Full Shot, Fantasy Art, Intricate, Magical Landscape. A majestic, shimmering, midnight blue and gold steam train with glowing wheels and headlights, emitting bright, golden-orange smoke, travels winding illuminated tracks up a steep, rocky mountain. In the distance, a large, ornate fairytale castle, glowing with warm golden lights, sits atop another peak, connected by the glowing tracks. The nighttime sky is deep blue, filled with twinkling stars and a prominent bright star in the upper left. Fluffy, dark clouds with golden highlights from the train's smoke fill the sky around the castle and train. The mountain peaks are rugged and dark, with sparse faint luminous dust or particles scattered around. The overall atmosphere is ethereal, dreamlike, and enchanting.\n\n**Elements:**\n* **Train:** Steampunk-inspired, regal, black and gold, highly detailed, glowing headlight and wheels, golden-orange smoke with glowing embers.\n* **Tracks:** Winding, golden-glowing, on a steep mountain path.\n* **Castle:** Fairytale, fantasy, intricate architecture, glowing windows and turrets, perched on a mountain peak.\n* **Mountains:** Dark, craggy, rocky, adding to the dramatic elevation.\n* **Sky:** Deep indigo blue, starry, with a prominent single bright star.\n* **Clouds/Smoke:** Voluminous, textured, interplay of dark and ethereal golden light.\n* **Atmosphere:** Magical, adventurous, nighttime journey.\n\n**Lighting:**\n* Luminous train and tracks with strong golden glow.\n* Warm, inviting lights from the castle.\n* Subtle, diffused light from celestial bodies.\n* Glowing embers within the train's smoke.\n\n**Colors:**\n* Predominantly deep blues,\n* Rich blacks,\n* Lustrous golds,\n* Warm oranges,\n* Touches of muted grays from the rocks.\n\n**Composition:**\n* Dynamic diagonal leading lines from the winding tracks.\n* Rule of thirds positioning for the train and castle, creating depth.\n* Clear foreground (train), mid-ground (mountain/tracks), and background (castle/sky).",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Stars explode into fiery bursts! Clouds violently churn and clash, spewing molten gold. The train's smokestack erupts, spewing a furious torrent of superheated steam. The train and tracks wildly surge and crackle with raw energy, throwing off blinding sparks. The castle lights flash and surge, transforming into dazzling, blinding explosions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The stars undulate, forming liquid galaxies while clouds morph into crystalline formations, emitting whispering echoes. Smoke from the train’s smokestack descends, solidifying into golden vines that anchor the glowing locomotive as it effortlessly ascends the mountain. The castle’s lights ripple, distorting space, while the track's glowing particles, defying gravity, form ethereal bridges to another dimension.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping crane establishes the magical night, revealing a majestic, steam-puffing train ascending a winding, luminous track toward a glowing castle. A subtle camera push follows the train as golden embers dance within its smoke. Then, a dramatic low-angle shot, slowly tracking the train's golden wheels and the sparkling particles rising from the tracks, crescendoing towards the shimmering, beckoning castle.",
