    "video_prompt": "Subtle swaying of the bus, light shimmering through foliage casting dancing shadows, slight movement of the girl's chest indicating breathing, gentle shimmer on her hair, sparse dust motes catching the light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nAnime style illustration, full-body shot of a melancholic long pink-haired schoolgirl with red eyes, wearing a white short-sleeved collared shirt, red bow tie, and dark pleated skirt, sitting on a dark green textured bus seat. She is hugging a black school bag to her chest, her head resting on it, looking downwards with closed or nearly closed eyes, suggesting sleep or sadness. The setting is inside an old bus or tram, clearly visible through large windows on the right and rear left. Sunlight streams through the windows, casting bright, dappled light on her legs and the bus interior, creating a warm, slightly dreamy atmosphere. Outside, lush green trees and a building with square windows are visible, hinting at a suburban or quiet urban street. The overall color palette is dominated by dark greens and blues inside the bus, contrasting with vibrant greens and soft whites/beiges outside, with hints of warm sunlight. The artwork has a soft, painterly texture, reminiscent of watercolor or traditional media, with subtle light specks on the floor. Cinematic lighting, deep shadows and bright highlights create depth. Gloomy but gentle mood.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Style:** Anime style illustration, painterly, watercolor-like texture.\n*   **Subject:**\n    *   **Character:** Melancholic schoolgirl.\n    *   **Hair:** Long pink hair, slightly messy, covering part of her face.\n    *   **Eyes:** Red eyes, looking downwards, potentially closed or nearly closed.\n    *   **Expression:** Melancholic, sleeping, or sad.\n    *   **Outfit:** White short-sleeved collared shirt, red bow tie, dark pleated skirt, white socks.\n    *   **Pose:** Sitting on a bus seat, hugging a black school bag to her chest, head resting on the bag.\n*   **Setting:**\n    *   **Location:** Inside an old bus or tram.\n    *   **Bus Interior:** Dark green textured seats, overhead handles, large windows.\n    *   **Outside Scene:** Lush green trees, a building with square windows (possibly a school or house), quiet suburban/urban street vibe.\n*   **Composition:**\n    *   Full-body shot skewed towards the lower right, with significant bus interior and exterior visible.\n    *   The girl is off-center, creating an asymmetric but balanced image.\n    *   Windows provide a strong visual frame for the outside world.\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   **Dominant:** Dark greens, blues (bus interior), vibrant greens (trees).\n    *   **Accents:** Pink (hair), white (shirt, sunlight), red (bow tie), beige/light grey (building).\n    *   **Lighting:** Warm sunlight streaming in, dappled light effects on the character and floor.

    "refined_video_prompt": "Rhythmic bus sway; dappled light dances through leaves; girl's chest subtly rises and falls; her hair catches faint glints; dust motes drift and shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The bus rips through reality, windows warp and shatter, trees outside contort into snapping claws. The girl's chest explodes with light, her hair whipping into a vortex of energy. Dust motes ignite, forming a dazzling, aggressive swarm. The seat she's on buckles and twists, threatening to jettison her into the rapidly fragmenting world. A supernatural surge of power courses through the scene, manifesting as violent tremors and implosions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The bus perpetually inverts, shedding ethereal passengers as trees outside bloom then retract into impossible forms. The girl's breath exhales future memories, her hair ripples with unseen wind, distorting into shimmering non-Euclidean patterns, as dust motes transmute into tiny, self-replicating nebulae, defying perception and physics.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The bus sways violently. Close-up: her eyes flutter open, revealing deep sadness. Quick pan across her chest, a faint, ragged breath. Extreme close-up: light glints off a tear escaping her eye. The bus lurches, throwing her head back dramatically, sunlight flares, momentarily blinding. Her hand clenches a worn bag as the bus abruptly halts, the silence deafening. Soft, golden dust motes swirl, catching the last dying light.",
