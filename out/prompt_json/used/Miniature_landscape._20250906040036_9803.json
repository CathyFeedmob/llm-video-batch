  "video_prompt": "A river flows, reflecting shimmering light. Circular glowing lights appear along its bank, subtly illuminating the scene. Out-of-focus, colored bokeh lights emerge in the sky, resembling distant stars. ",
  "image_prompt": "Vertical, serene miniature landscape at dusk/night. A winding river with grey stone banks flows through vibrant, illuminated green grass patches. Small, textured green trees are scattered, with foreground trees catching warm golden light. Silhouetted mountains against a deep blue to orange-pink gradient sky with numerous out-of-focus, colorful bokeh lights (stars/fairy lights). Glowing circular pathway lights line the river bank. Detailed foreground, soft focus background. Rich greens, blues, and warm golden tones. Rendered/digital diorama style.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "The river's current ceaselessly flows, creating a continuous play of shifting, shimmering reflections. Along the bank, luminous energy progressively coalesces into glowing forms, their radiance intensifying and expanding to dynamically reshape the scene's illumination. Simultaneously, in the distant sky, light sources actively emerge and gently drift, gradually softening and diffusing as they move, altering the background's atmospheric quality."
