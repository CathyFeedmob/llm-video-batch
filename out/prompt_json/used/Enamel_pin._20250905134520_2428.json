  "image_prompt": "Extreme close-up of a playful, eclectic tableau of enamel pins and natural elements on a light beige background. Central is a rectangular New York City landmark pin (Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, yellow taxi, \"New York NYC\"). Surrounding it are a pizza pin, mushroom pins, pine cones, and green maple leaves. Soft, even lighting, with a \"c29\" signature.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Enamel pins and natural elements dynamically slide and rotate into an arrangement. A landmark pin's hinged mechanism actively opens and closes. A pizza pin fluidly melts, then reforms its shape. Pine cones roll, while maple leaves unfurl. Mushroom pins subtly morph in their appearance. The \"c29\" logo dynamically appears and subsequently fades from view."
