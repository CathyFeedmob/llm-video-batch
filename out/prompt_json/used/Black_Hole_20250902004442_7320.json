  "video_prompt": "A colossal digital vortex rapidly rotates and flows, glowing segments drawing inward at immense speed with swirling particles. A lone figure gazes fixedly into its depths. Ripples emanate outwards from their feet on the reflective surface, where the vortex's shifting light creates dynamic reflections. The distant twilight sky subtly changes color.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, designed for clarity and impact, suitable for an image generation model:\n\n**\"Highly stylized digital artwork, science fiction/fantasy aesthetic. A colossal, vertically oriented, spiraling vortex of fractured light and digital elements dominates the scene, rendered in vibrant electric blues, whites, and striking reds, receding into a deep black void like a gateway to another dimension. A lone, silhouetted figure stands small and contemplative, back to the viewer, gazing into its glowing depths. The dark, futuristic landscape features a highly reflective, dark blue-black surface mirroring the intense light, with a vibrant red reflective path extending from the figure. Dramatic lighting, ethereal, awe-inspiring, wonder, solitude, mystery.\"**",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Rapid rotation and inward flow dominate, with glowing segments drawing inward at immense speed and particles swirling. A fixed gaze remains absorbed. Ripples emanate outwards from beneath, as shifting light dynamically reflects. The distant sky's colors subtly change."
