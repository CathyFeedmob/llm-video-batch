    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive roar as emerald tiger lunges, skin rippling like a stormy sea! Fur erupts, claws extending, a dynamic leap throwing the startled rabbit into a chaotic aerial spin. The very ground buckles under the tiger's mighty impact as supernatural energy surges outwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The gravity-defying tiger, a vibrant green, melts into liquid stripes as its whiskers ripple like ethereal seaweed. The white bunny, perched atop, inflates gently, then shrinks, its ears unfurling into delicate, translucent wings, carrying it aloft in a reverse waterfall of light. Both animals morph from solid to shimmering vapor, then reform in a continuous, impossible dance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low, wide shot pans across the tiger's textured, green skin, highlighting its subtle weight shift. A dramatic zoom-in reveals the gentle sway of its whiskers, almost imperceptibly, as the camera quickly cuts to a close-up of the bunny's twitching nose, then its gently swaying ears, the background subtly blurring. A sweeping crane shot from above descends, showcasing the tiger's powerful, poised stance, followed by a sudden, intense POV shot from the ground as the tiger's paw slowly yet decisively extends forward, filling the frame.",
