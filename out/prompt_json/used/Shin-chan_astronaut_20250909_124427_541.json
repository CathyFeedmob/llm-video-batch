    "video_prompt": "A subtle dust plume rises from the lunar dust near the giant astronaut's body. The small astronaut's shadow subtly lengthens and shortens as if the distant sun flickers slightly. The distant UFO wobbles slightly as fine debris drifts around its form.",
    "image_prompt": "A surreal, atmospheric, highly detailed digital painting of an astronaut approaching a gigantic, crashed cartoon character (Shinnosuke Nohara from Crayon Shin-chan) on the moon. The scene is viewed from a slightly elevated, wide-angle perspective looking down into a massive impact crater.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Central Figure (Crashed Character):** A colossal, broken Crayon Shin-chan head is integrated into a damaged astronaut suit, lying prone within the huge lunar crater. His face shows cracks, suggesting an impact. The suit is white with red accents, realistic in detail despite the cartoon character it houses. Smoke or dust rises subtly around his body.\n*   **Foreground Figure (Astronaut):** A lone, realistic astronaut in a clean white suit, facing away from the viewer, stands on the lunar surface in the foreground, looking down towards the crashed character. Their shadow stretches long behind them.\n*   **Lunar Surface:** The moon's surface is rocky, with numerous smaller craters and deep cracks extending from the main impact site. The texture is rough and dusty, with subtle grey and brown tones. Wisps of dust/vapor rise from the crater.\n*   **Background (Space & Earth):** In the upper part of the image, above the lunar horizon, a deep blue band of Earth's atmosphere transitions into the blackness of space, dotted with faint stars.\n*   **UFO/Spaceship:** A large, classic saucer-shaped UFO with glowing windows hovers above the Earth's atmosphere, casting a large shadow on the clouds below. It is realistic and metallic.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The main impact crater and the crashed character occupy the middle and lower-middle sections. The astronaut is in the bottom center. The UFO and Earth/space occupy the top third.\n*   **Depth:** Strong sense of depth created by the large foreground astronaut, the vast crater, and the distant Earth and UFO.\n*   **Leading Lines:** The cracks in the moondust lead the eye towards the central impact and the crashed character.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Surrealism/Sci-Fi Art:** Blends realistic sci-fi elements (astronaut, moon, space, UFO) with a cartoon character, creating a dreamlike and unusual juxtaposition.\n*   **Hyperrealism/Photorealism:** Highly detailed textures on the astronaut suits, moon surface, and UFO, resembling photographic quality.\n*   **Cinematic:** Evokes a sense of grandeur and a dramatic narrative.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Neutrals:** Greys of the moon surface, white of the astronaut suits, black of space.\n*   **Accents:** Subtle blue and white of Earth's atmosphere, hints of orange-red on the Shin-chan suit, glowing yellow/white lights on the UFO. Skin tones on Shin-chan's face are light peach.\n*   **Overall Pallet:** Cool and subdued, with the bright white suits providing contrast.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Dramatic:** Strong directional light from an unseen source (sun) casting long, sharp shadows from the astronaut and features on the lunar surface. This suggests a low sun angle.\n*   **Atmospheric:** Light subtly illuminates the rising dust/smoke from the crater.\n*   **Glowing Elements:** Internal lighting from the UFO's windows.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mystery & Awe:** A sense of discovering something extraordinary and inexplicable.\n*   **Isolation & Vastness:** Emphasized by the lone astronaut in a desolate, enormous landscape.\n*   **Melancholy:** The crashed and broken character adds a somber, perhaps slightly humorous, tone.\n\n**Artistic Signature:** A small \"c29\" signature in the lower-right side near the crashed character.\n\n**Art Medium/Render Quality:** Digital painting, highly detailed, octane render, 8k, volumetric lighting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Giant astronaut's body subtly disturbs lunar dust, causing a soft plume to rise. Small astronaut's shadow subtly pulses, lengthening and shortening. Distant UFO rocks gently, encircled by drifting debris.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The immense Shin-chan astronaut's head cracks, unleashing a torrent of glowing energy! Lunar dust explodes upwards, consumed by the pulsating aura. The UFO abruptly descends, violently shaking as debris collides around it. The small astronaut scrambles backward, his shadow lashing out like whips across the convulsing lunar surface.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The giant astronaut's body levitates, slowly rotating as dust forms into shimmering galaxies around it. The small astronaut’s shadow dances independently, growing impossibly long then shrinking into a pinpoint, its movements hinting at unseen multidimensional shifts. The UFO pulsates, stretching and contracting like a breath, emitting spectral whispers as debris forms into ephemeral, self-reversing cascades.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera circles the colossal astronaut, revealing its impact crater. A smaller astronaut slowly approaches, casting a long, shifting shadow as if the moon's light itself strains under the cosmic event. Then, smoke billows from the monumental, fallen figure. In the distance, a massive UFO drifts, lights flickering mysteriously, its subtle sway echoed by the debris field around it.",
