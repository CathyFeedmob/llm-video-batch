  "video_prompt": "A woman's face subtly shifts, as fractured ice/crystal elements along her right side subtly glow and recede, then reform. Her pearlescent skin subtly shimmers with shifting blue and purple light. Her sheer, iridescent attire subtly sways, reflecting changing light. Jewelry gently sways. The dark, swirling background subtly undulates.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Vertical digital artwork, surreal portrait of a woman with long flowing platinum blonde hair, chest up, intense ethereal gaze. Pearlescent translucent skin with cool blue and purple light. Left eye normal pale blue, right side of face fractured with glowing blue/purple ice or crystal shards emanating from temple and eye. Intricate silver/platinum jewelry with blue gemstones and clear crystals. Sheer iridescent fabric attire in blue, silver, and purple. Dark, indistinct swirling blue/black background. Mystical, icy, fragile, inner turmoil.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A woman's expression subtly evolves. Fractured ice/crystal elements along her right side glow, recede, then reform. Her pearlescent skin shimmers with shifting blue and purple light. Her sheer, iridescent attire subtly sways, reflecting dynamic light, as jewelry gently sways. The dark, swirling background subtly undulates."
