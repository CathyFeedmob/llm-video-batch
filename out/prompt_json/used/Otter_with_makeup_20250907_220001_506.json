    "video_prompt": "A subtle sniff from the otter, with a slight head tilt. Its tiny paws slightly adjust on the mascara wand. A shimmer reflects off the mirror's surface. Tiny whiskers twitch.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA charming, hyperrealistic 3D render of a baby otter, with soft brown fur and light beige-white underparts, sitting upright on a light wooden floor. The otter has large, glossy black eyes and visible pink blush on its cheeks, with exaggerated long, curled pink eyelashes. It holds a black mascara wand in its left paw. Directly in front of the otter is a small, light wooden table (like a miniature vanity) on which various makeup items are laid out: three circular compacts with light pink powder, three upright tubes of pink liquid lipstick/lip gloss, and a set of makeup brushes. To the right of the otter, a round vanity mirror with a thin silver frame reflects a slightly blurry, upward-tilting view of the otter's face, showing its pink eyelashes and mascara wand. The background is a soft, out-of-focus gradient of warm beige to light grey, creating a shallow depth of field. The lighting is soft and ambient, highlighting the otter's fur and the textures of the wooden table and floor. The overall atmosphere is cute, whimsical, and endearing.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The otter's head tilts slightly as its nose subtly twitches. Its tiny paws gently shift on the mascara wand. A faint shimmer plays across the mirror's surface. Its tiny whiskers quiver.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A furious flutter of otters, a sudden head snap. Paws, now transformed into claws, violently tear the mascara wand. The mirror shatters explosively, shards flying like projectiles. Whiskers whip, charged with crackling energy, sparking and igniting the very air. Makeup explodes into swirling vortexes of color, consuming the scene in a mesmerizing, destructive ballet.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cosmetic table elevates, floating to align with the otter's gaze as mascara wands sprout wings, fluttering around its head. Pink blush powders ignite, forming swirling nebulae within the mirror, reflecting countless alternate otter realities. The otter's whiskers stretch into shimmering light whips, painting colors onto the air as its reflection blinks out of existence, leaving a starry void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "* **Camera:** Slow, dramatic push-in to the otter's face, focusing on its pink-dusted eyes.\n* **Action:** The otterâ€™s head tilts, a faint sniff. Its tiny paws, with unexpected grace, tighten their grip on the mascara wand.\n* **Camera:** A quick, sharp rack focus to the mirror, catching a glint of light as the otter's reflection, seemingly more confident, gazes back.\n* **Action:** A single, almost imperceptible twitch of a whisker, creating a ripple of anticipation across the frame.",
