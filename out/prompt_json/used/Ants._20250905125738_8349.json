The convoy of anthropomorphic ants progresses along a curving dirt road, with trees swaying gently as dappled light shifts. Nuts occasionally tumble from the trucks onto the forest floor.",
  "image_prompt": "Cheerful cartoon illustration, children's book style: A convoy of vintage pickup trucks, driven by anthropomorphic ants, transports a bounty of large nuts along a sun-dappled dirt road winding through a lush, leafy forest. Vibrant colors, clear lines, and detailed textures. Focus on a bright green lead truck overflowing with nuts, driven by an ant in a fedora. Other trucks (green, red, yellow) follow, extended into the distance. Forest floor detailed with plants, flowers, mushrooms, and fallen leaves. Soft blue sky with wispy clouds. Industrial, communal, natural theme.",
