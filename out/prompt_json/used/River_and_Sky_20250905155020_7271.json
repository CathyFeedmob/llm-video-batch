  "image_prompt": "Aerial shot of a breathtaking sunset over a winding river system, reflecting vibrant orange and yellow skies with serene blue overhead. Altocumulus clouds in parallel rows create a quilted texture mirrored perfectly on the water. Flat, open terrain with muted green and brown vegetation borders the river. Emphasize peace, natural beauty, and warm hues. High vantage point, wide-angle.",

Light streaks dynamically traverse the sky, then diminish. The river's subtle flow distorts all surface reflections."
