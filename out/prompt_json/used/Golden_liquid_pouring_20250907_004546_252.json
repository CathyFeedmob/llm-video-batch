    "video_prompt": "Honey drips steadily from the clouds, creating ripples on the chocolate-covered surface. The tiny figures subtly shift their weight, and their reflections shimmer in the liquid. Bokeh lights gently pulse and float upwards.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A fantastical, food-themed landscape. Golden liquid honey or syrup streams down from a light blue and peach-colored sky, originating from soft, fluffy white clouds at the top of the frame. Some streams are thick and continuous, while others are thin threads with individual glistening drops. The honey/syrup forms a flowing river or stream at the bottom, with a rich, inviting brown color that reflects the light.\n\nNumerous round, light brown, textured biscuits (like digestives or graham crackers) float on the surface of this liquid. Some are single, others are stacked in small piles. Small, doll-like figures (approximately 1-2 inches tall) of children dressed in vibrant red, yellow, and orange jackets with black pants are scattered across the biscuits and along the edges of the liquid, appearing to walk or stand. Their postures suggest movement and exploration.\n\nOn the sides of the liquid, particularly to the right, there are large, textured formations resembling light brown or orangey-gold sugar crystals or porous candy structures, sparkling with embedded light points creating a sugary or effervescent texture.\n\nThe lighting is bright and warm, with a golden hour glow, emphasizing the reflective quality of the honey and the sparkling elements. There's a soft, dreamy atmosphere with a shallow depth of field, blurring the background elements, but keeping the foreground details sharp. Bokeh lights are visible throughout, adding to the magical and playful feel. The overall composition is a dynamic vertical shot, guiding the eye from the sky down to the biscuit path and child figures. A subtle hint of the text \"c29\" in a metallic gold font is present in the lower right corner, blending with the reflections.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Honey continuously streams, forming expanding ripples. Figures subtly reorient, their reflections wavering. Bokeh lights gently throb and drift upwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Clouds violently convulse, spewing molten gold that slams into the chocolate, generating geysers and explosive ripples. Miniature figures frantically scramble across the tumultuous surface as the liquid roils and churns. Bokeh flares ignite, streaking upward like exploding fireworks. Cookies abruptly lift and plunge, creating chaotic splashes. The entire scene pulsates with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Golden honey strings defy gravity, ascending from liquid chocolate, pulling the tiny figures skyward from their biscuit rafts. Reflections stretch and warp, becoming shimmering constellations as bokeh lights dance downwards, phasing through clouds that melt and reform into sugary foam.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera pans down, revealing golden honey pouring like waterfalls from wispy clouds, creating swirling ripples on a dark chocolate lake. A close-up shot focuses on miniature figures, their reflections shimmering as they cautiously navigate biscuit islands. Suddenly, a figure stumbles, their shadow dancing across the glistening surface as a dramatic lens flare engulfs the scene, leaving sparkling bokeh lights floating upwards into the ethereal sky.",
