    "video_prompt": "Gentle rise and fall of the blanket and the girl's chest, subtle sway of curtains, sunbeams slowly traverse the floor, reflections shimmer on surfaces, faint flicker on TV screen.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed anime-style illustration of a cozy room with a sleepy girl. The room is dimly lit, with bright sunlight streaming in from a large window on the left, casting warm light patterns on the tatami mat floor.\n\n**Composition:**\nThe image is a medium-shot, showing a significant portion of the room. The window is on the left, an old CRT television is centered on a wooden cabinet, and a girl is sleeping on the floor in the foreground, slightly to the right. A small wooden table with a plate of watermelon slices and a blue fan are in the bottom left corner.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Sleeping Girl:** A young girl with short dark hair, wearing a light orange floral top, is sleeping on her side on the tatami mat floor. She rests her head on a pink pillow over a blue cushion. A floral blanket with red and pink flowers covers her body from the waist down.\n*   **Window:** A large wooden-framed window on the left shows lush green trees outside, indicating a sunny day. The light from the window is bright, almost overexposed.\n*   **Television:** An old-fashioned CRT television set with two antennas sits on a dark wooden cabinet. The screen displays an animated scene of two children tending to plants (one boy in yellow, one girl in green).\n*   **Furniture:** A dark wooden cabinet/desk is under the TV, filled with books and various items. A smaller, dark wooden table is in the foreground, holding a white plate with two slices of watermelon.\n*   **Fan:** A vintage-looking blue electric fan is to the left of the small table.\n*   **Room Details:** The walls are a textured, dark gray. There are papers, possibly calendars or posters, on the wall above the TV. A patterned dark cushion is on the tatami mat floor in the bottom right foreground.\n\n**Style:**\nAnime, hand-drawn illustration with a soft, slightly textured look, reminiscent of traditional animation cells or watercolor art.\n\n**Colors:**\n Dominant colors are muted blues and grays for the walls and fan, contrasting with the warm, vibrant greens of the trees, the bright yellow and orange sunlight, and the red/pink floral patterns on the blanket and the girl's top. The watermelon adds a splash of red and green.\n\n**Lighting:**\nHigh contrast and atmospheric.Strong, warm sunlight from the window creates distinct light and shadow areas on the floor, highlighting the girl and parts of the room. The rest of the room is in soft shadow, giving a cozy, relaxed feel. The TV screen glows from within.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nPeaceful, cozy, tranquil, nostalgic, and summery. It evokes a feeling of quiet relaxation and warmth, possibly during a lazy afternoon nap.\n\n**Artistic touches:**\nSlight watercolor-like textures. The visible brushstrokes or digital textures add to the artistic quality. The signature \"c29\" is in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle chest rise and fall, gentle curtain sway, slow sunbeam progression, shimmering surface reflections, faint TV screen flicker.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent shudder of the entire room, floorboards splintering as walls pulsate, curtains thrashing wildly, sunbeams erupting into explosive flashes, reflections warping into distorted vortexes, TV screen bleeding vibrant, chaotic light, the girl's body contorting with an otherworldly energy, blanket thrashing as if possessed, fan blades spinning into a blur, furniture jolting and scraping.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The blanket slowly ascends, pulling the girl's chest skyward, as sunbeams twist and stretch into shimmering ribbons, dancing backward around the room. The TV screen pulses with impossible colors, its image of children transforming into swirling, liquid light that spills across the floor, consuming the sunbeams. Watermelon slices levitate and re-form into a whole fruit, which then dissolves into a swirling vortex of seeds. The fan blades melt and reform into a blooming flower.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Slow, deliberate push-in on the sleeping girl, her chest subtly rising and falling. A soft pan right, gradually revealing the wavering TV light, reflected faintly on the dark desk. Camera settles slightly above the TV, then a dramatic, slow zoom into the window as sunbeams, with dust motes dancing, steadily creep across the floor, illuminating the patterned blanket before fading to black.",
