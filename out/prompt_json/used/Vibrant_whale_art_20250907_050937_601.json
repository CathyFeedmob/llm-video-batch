    "video_prompt": "The whale slowly exhales a plume of sparkling mist. Golden specks gently drift upwards and across the frame. The red and blue flame-like patterns on the whale's body subtly undulate and flicker, mimicking the movement of fire. Slight parallax shift as if floating through space.",
    "image_prompt": "A majestic whale, rendered in a bold Hokusai-inspired woodblock print style, leaps upwards against a stark black background. The whale's body is a vibrant teal, adorned with golden, textured barnacle-like patterns that glint. Striking red and purple wavy, flame-like tendrils billow from its back and sides, creating a dynamic sense of movement and energy. The whale's underside is a crisp white with fine, linear details that evoke baleen. A scattering of luminous golden speckles resembling stars or glittering water droplets surrounds the whale, with subtle smoky accents near its tail. The overall composition is vertical, emphasizing the whale's upward trajectory, and the lighting is dramatic, highlighting the bright colors against the deep darkness. The signature \"c29\" is discreetly placed in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Prompt:**\n\n*   **Plume Expansion & Ascent:** A shimmering mist expands and rises.\n*   **Glittering Drift:** Golden specks gently disperse upwards and sideways.\n*   **Body Undulation & Flicker:** Red and blue patterns ripple and pulse.\n*   **Subtle Lateral Shift:** A gradual lateral drift implies forward motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The whale violently exhales *explosive* golden dust, fragments erupting outward, consuming the frame! Red and blue flame-like patterns *aggressively* writhe and whip across its body, intensely flickering and transforming like a living inferno. The background *rapidly* distorts, ripping open as if traversing a chaotic void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravitic inversions send golden specks morphing into crystalline structures, then dissolving into shimmering cosmic dust as they descend upwards. The whale's flame-like patterns, now sentient tendrils, writhe and intertwine, pulling the whale through a spacetime vortex where red and blue hues bleed into impossible spectral shifts. Dimensions fold, revealing glimpses of a reverse-flowing ocean, as the entire image undulates to an unheard, impossible symphony.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A majestic whale glides through cosmic dust, exhaling a shimmering golden nebula. The camera dramatically zooms in on its eye, reflecting an ancient, glowing constellation. As fiery tendrils on its body pulse with intensified red and blue light, the whale majestically breaches, causing the golden nebula to explode outwards in a blinding flash, revealing a deeper, swirling void beyond. The camera slowly pulls back, leaving the whale a luminous speck in the endless expanse.",
