  "video_prompt": "A lone figure stands, head subtly tilted, lost in contemplation as a grand cosmic display unfolds. An intense golden light beam slowly widens and diffuses downwards, its core pulsating with pure white energy. Symmetrical nebulae of swirling golden-orange fiery rivers and electric blue wisps constantly shift, shimmer, and subtly alter their organic patterns, like colossal, evolving wings. Dark clouds below the celestial energy gently transform. Small, glowing embers flicker gently on the rugged ground around the figure, mirroring the cosmic dance above, while the shifting light subtly plays across the figure's form.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from more descriptive to highly concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Evocative):**\nA breathtaking, vertically oriented and strikingly symmetrical image of a lone human figure, viewed from behind, standing on dark, rugged terrain with scattered glowing embers. He gazes upwards from a low perspective at an immense, brilliant golden light beam descending from above, flanked by majestic, swirling cosmic nebulae of vibrant golden-orange and electric blue, resembling colossal wings or a celestial tree. The palette is dominated by deep blues, fiery oranges, and brilliant gold, with dramatic lighting creating stark contrasts. An atmosphere of profound wonder, cosmic grandeur, and spiritual awe.\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\nVertical, symmetrical, low-angle shot: A lone figure from behind stands on dark, rocky ground with glowing embers, gazing at a colossal golden light beam. This beam is flanked by swirling, wing-like cosmic nebulae in vibrant golden-orange and electric blue. Deep blues, fiery oranges, and brilliant gold dominate the dramatic, high-contrast cosmic scene, evoking profound wonder and awe.\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise):**\nA solitary man, seen from behind, on a dark, rugged ground with glowing embers, gazes up at a towering golden light beam and symmetrical, wing-like blue and orange cosmic nebulae. Vertical, low-angle, high contrast. Colors: deep blue, fiery orange, brilliant gold. Mood: Cosmic grandeur, wonder, spiritual awe.",
