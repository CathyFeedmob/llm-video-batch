    "video_prompt": "A subtle left-to-right camera drift. The red lights on the bridge flicker softly. Wisps of smoke drift lazily from the left structure. Distant city lights twinkle faintly. The clouds in the sky transition slowly, as if with time-lapse. The figures on the platform might subtly shift their weight or glance around.",
    "image_prompt": "A gritty, detailed matte painting of a colossal, dilapidated suspension bridge spanning a deep chasm. The bridge's structure is heavily aged, rusted, and covered in intricate, almost cyberpunk-like technological elements, including glowing red 'eye' shaped lights integrated into its underside and pillars. The sky is a dramatic gradient of smoky grey and soft orange, transitioning to a vibrant fiery orange at the horizon, indicating either sunrise or sunset. Wisps of smoke rise from structures below the bridge.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left, two figures stand on a precarious, wooden-looking platform built into the cliff face, gazing out at the vast cityscape in the distance, bathed in the warm orange light. The cityscape is silhouetted, with towering modern skyscrapers contrasting with what appear to be older, more industrial buildings. The chasm below is shrouded in a reddish-orange haze, hinting at an abyss or dense pollution. The overall atmosphere is dystopian, awe-inspiring, and slightly melancholic, combining industrial decay with natural beauty.\n\nVisual elements: Dilapidated suspension bridge, glowing red 'eye' lights, figures on a platform, industrial cliff structures, distant silhouetted cityscape, deep chasm.\nStyle: Matte painting, dystopian, cyberpunk hints, industrial decay, realistic yet stylized.\nComposition: Low angle shot looking up at the massive bridge, strong diagonal lines of the bridge, figures positioned for scale and focal point, deep perspective into the chasm and distant city.\nColors: Dominant warm oranges, fiery reds (lights), smoky greys, deep dark browns and blacks for the bridge and cliffs, touches of pale blue in the far sky.\nLighting: Dramatic sunset/sunrise lighting, strong backlighting from the horizon, casting silhouetted figures and city, harsh glowing red lights on the bridge.\nAtmosphere: Dystopian, colossal, awe-inspiring, melancholic, industrial, post-apocalyptic.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle left camera drift. Red bridge lights softly flicker. Smoke lazily drifts left. Distant city lights faintly twinkle. Clouds slowly transition. Figures on platform subtly shift weight or glance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The colossal bridge structure groans and warps, its red lights flaring erratically, then exploding. Jagged fissures rip across the cliff faces, sending debris hurtling into the abyss. The distant city dissolves into a chaotic blur of light and shadow, the sky boiling with an unnatural storm. Tendrils of dark energy erupt from the platform, engulfing the figures as they violently contort.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The bridge's red lights pulse erratically, pulling the camera leftwards against its will. Wisps of smoke coalesce into ethereal, glowing figures that float skyward. Distant city lights expand and contract like breathing organisms. Clouds swirl into kaleidoscopic patterns, revealing glimpses of inverted landscapes. The figures on the platform phase in and out of existence, leaving trails of starlight.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A subtle left-to-right camera drift. The red lights on the bridge flicker softly, one by one, creating a pulsing effect. Wisps of smoke drift lazily from the left structure, growing denser. Distant city lights twinkle faintly, then brighten. The clouds in the sky transition slowly, as if with time-lapse, revealing moonrise. The figures on the platform might subtly shift their weight, then one points towards the darkening sky and the other looks up, as if in awe.",
