  "video_prompt": "A heavily armed, vibrant red futuristic train speeds along an elevated track, high above a sea of pink-tinged clouds. Its intricate mechanical understructure, a tangle of robotic limbs, gears, and pistons, actively crawls and propels the massive train forward. Twin cannons are poised atop the locomotive as glowing headlights cut through the atmosphere. Faint energy trails streak across the vast blue sky, emphasizing the train's rapid, powerful movement through this high-altitude environment.",
  "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, futuristic, heavily armed red train with a blocky, mecha-inspired design, vibrant red, grey, and black accents. It features glowing yellow-orange headlights, a prominent twin-barreled cannon turret, and intricate exposed mechanical details. The train moves along elevated tracks, uniquely supported by a massive, elaborate, animated robotic understructure of moving limbs, gears, and pistons. It is set high above a sea of fluffy white and soft pinkish clouds under a vast bright blue sky, bathed in dawn/dusk light. Dynamic low-angle perspective looking up at the train's front-right. Anime/manga style, clean line art, detailed mechanical rendering, bold colors, stylized illustration, epic and powerful atmosphere.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "A swift, red-hued transport surges forward on an elevated path. Its understructure actively articulates, with robotic components visibly crawling and propelling it. Dual cannons subtly track targets. Beaming headlights intensely slice through the atmosphere. Below, clouds continually undulate and drift, displaying pink hues. Energy trails powerfully streak across the vast sky, dynamically emphasizing its rapid, powerful, high-altitude traversal."
