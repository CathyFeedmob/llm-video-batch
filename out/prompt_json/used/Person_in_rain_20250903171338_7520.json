  "video_prompt": "A person walks slowly on a wet city street at night, holding an umbrella. Rain streaks visibly through the air. Car headlights and streetlights gleam on reflective surfaces, shifting as vehicles pass. Puddles ripple, mirroring distorted lights. Shop signs blur and refocus in the background. The figure's expression subtly shifts from contemplative to melancholic.",
  "image_prompt": "Black and white, rainy city night, solo young woman with short dark hair, contemplative, holding umbrella on wet sidewalk. She wears a shiny rainjacket and backpack. Reflections of cars, streetlights, and blurred city elements on wet surfaces. Streaks of rain and puddles, emphasizing a mood of quiet solitude and urban introspection.",
