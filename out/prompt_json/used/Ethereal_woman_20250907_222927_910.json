    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze subtly sways the woman's hair and the flowing fabric of her gown, causing the shimmering particles trailing behind her to drift and sparkle softly. The luminous petals of the lotus slowly radiate an inner glow, while the stars in the night sky twinkle with varying intensity. A subtle, slow zoom out reveals more of the starry expanse.",
    "image_prompt": "```\nA majestic full-body shot of a goddess-like woman with long, flowing silver hair, wearing an exquisite, vibrant cerulean blue gown that cascades into a shimmering, starry river of light and sparkling particles. She stands before a majestic, elaborate lotus flower mandala, glowing with white light and detailed with ornate white and silver crystalline patterns, radiating outward from behind her. The background is a breathtaking cosmic night sky, showcasing the Milky Way galaxy with countless twinkling stars, creating a deep ethereal atmosphere. The lighting emanates from behind the woman and the mandala, casting a brilliant glow that accentuates her silhouette and the intricate details of the lotus. The overall style is fantasy art with a touch of spiritual and celestial beauty, rendered with stunning detail and vibrant colors that make the blues and whites particularly striking against the dark starry backdrop. The composition is dynamic, with the goddess looking slightly over her shoulder, drawing the viewer's eye along the flowing train of her dress into the starry expanse.\n```",

The lotus petals violently unfurl, emitting blinding, pulsating light that reverberates through the tearing fabric of space. Stars ignite with explosive flares, streaking across the rapidly expanding cosmic void as the entire scene pulls back at breakneck speed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's gown, a river of shimmering stardust, defies gravity, pooling upward and dissolving into the Milky Way. Lotus petals unfurl in reverse, absorbing starlight, transforming into swirling nebulae. Stars fall like rain into the glowing abyss of the petal's core, then erupt outward, forming new, impossible constellations. The scene slowly rotates, revealing cosmic ripples propagating from the woman's ethereal form, warping time itself.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A celestial light slowly emanates from the blooming lotus, illuminating the woman's vibrant blue gown as her hair gently sways.
