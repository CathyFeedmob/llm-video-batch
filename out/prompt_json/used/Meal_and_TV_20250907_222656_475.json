    "video_prompt": "A slight shimmer on the surface of the drinks. A subtle swaying of the plant leaves as if from a gentle breeze. The animated characters on the screen appear to blink their eyes. The steam gently rises from the bowls of soup and rice.",
    "image_prompt": "A full shot, eye-level, wide shot of a dining table scene, featuring a wooden tray with various dishes and a computer monitor displaying an animated kitchen scene.\n\n**Visual Elements and Composition:**\n- **Foreground (left):** A potted plant with vibrant green leaves and a modern gray pot filled with dark soil.\n- **Center:** A flat-screen computer monitor displaying an animated kitchen scene. The screen shows two animated characters (Crayon Shin-chan) in a cartoon kitchen. One character is in a red shirt and yellow apron, standing near a stove with a kettle. The other character, also in a red shirt, is seated at a counter with two plates of food. The kitchen background is light blue and white with some brown accents.\n- **Dining Tray (center-right to bottom):** A light brown wooden tray holds several white bowls and a glass mug.\n    - **From left to right on the tray:**\n        - A white bowl overflowing with fluffy white rice, topped with black and brown sesame seeds.\n        - A white bowl of a savory soup with large chunks of meat (beef ribs), round carrots, and potato cubes.\n        - A glass mug of light amber beverage (beer or iced tea) with ice cubes, featuring a smiling cartoon face and the text \"Beeskins\" printed on it. The mug rests on a checkered cloth coaster.\n        - Below the beef soup, another white bowl of clear soup containing chunks of corn on the cob (cut into rounds) and potato cubes, along with round carrot slices.\n        - A large white oval dish filled with stir-fried beef slices, garnished with fresh green cilantro leaves and bright red chili peppers sliced into rings. The beef has a glossy, dark brown sauce.\n\n**Style and Atmosphere:**\n- **Overall:** Bright and appealing, with a focus on food presentation and a whimsical touch from the animated screen.\n- **Food:** Looks fresh, appealing, and well-prepared.\n- **Lighting:** Soft, even lighting, suggesting natural light from an unseen window. There are slight shadows under the bowls and objects, indicating depth.\n- **Colors:** Vibrant and natural, with greens from the plant and cilantro, reds from chili, rich browns from the beef and wood, and the cool tones of the animated kitchen. The white bowls provide contrast.\n- **Texture:** Noticeable textures on the wooden table and tray, the rice grains, the crisp cilantro, and the soft sheen on the beef.\n\n**Background:**\n- A plain, light beige/tan wall provides a clean and uncluttered backdrop, allowing the foreground elements to stand out.\n\n**Shot Details:**\n- **Camera Angle:** Eye-level, offering a direct view of the setup.\n- **Composition:** Well-balanced, with elements arranged harmoniously on the tray and the monitor as a central focal point.\n- **Depth of Field:** Sharply in focus from the plant to the front edge of the tray.\n\n**Watermark:** A faint \"c29\" in black script is visible on the bottom right of the wooden tabletop.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle liquid undulations. Gentle leaf rustle. Character eye blinks. Wisps of steam ascend.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The entire tabletop violently *jerks* forward, trays sliding. The plant *whips* its leaves, contorting. The animated characters on the screen *lunge* from the display, eyes *flashing* with intense light, their figures distorting reality. Drinks *erupt* from their glasses, the liquid *coiling* into a vortex. Steam from soup bowls *explodes* upward, forming swirling, fiery columns. The rice *quivers* and *shatters* into a cloud of particles.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The steam from the soup and rice billows upwards, then morphs into dancing humanoid figures reminiscent of the cartoon characters, who then float into the screen, replacing the static images. The liquid in the glass shimmers with an internal luminescence, then reverses its flow, retreating into the glass. The plant leaves ripple and unfurl like ephemeral wings, lifting the entire plant off the table. The entire wooden tray beneath food starts slowly rotating and rising over the table.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Cinematic master shot reveals the vibrant setup. A gentle breeze rustles the plant's leaves, leading to a subtle shiver on the drink's surface. Suddenly, the animated characters on the screen blink in unison. Steam dramatically rises and swirls from the hot bowls of soup and rice, creating a mystical haze.",
