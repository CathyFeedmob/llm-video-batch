  "video_prompt": "A lone, hooded figure subtly shifts weight in a bustling, rain-slicked city street, neon reflections rippling on the wet ground. Distant pedestrians move through the cool-toned urban landscape as lights flicker. The scene fluidly dissolves and bleeds into a clean background, revealing a human head silhouette. Inside, a warm-toned cityscape shimmers and subtly transforms, representing evolving introspection. Watercolor textures actively wash, splatter, and drip across the frame, connecting the external city's melancholic movement with the mind's changing landscape.",
