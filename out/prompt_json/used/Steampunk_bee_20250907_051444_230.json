    "video_prompt": "Subtle wing membrane rippling, very slight antenna twitch, a gentle pulsate of the gold bands on the abdomen.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, photorealistic 3D render of a steampunk-style mechanical bee, predominantly emerald green and gold. The bee is captured in a dynamic flying pose against a dark grey, slightly dark background.\n\n**Visual Elements:** The bee's body is segmented, featuring a vibrant emerald green on the head and thorax, with alternating green and gold stripes on the abdomen. The green surfaces have a metallic, slightly reflective sheen. Intricate mechanical details are visible, including brass gears, springs, bolts, and flexible tubing connecting various parts of its body. Its head features large, dark, multifaceted eyes with a subtle purple glint, and two slender, segmented antennae. The legs are jointed with alternating dark metallic and green segments, ending in delicate, gold, claw-like feet. The wings are translucent, resembling delicate insect wings but with a distinct metallic gold venation pattern, suggesting a delicate yet strong structure. Tiny specks or dust particles are visible on the wings.\n\n**Style:** Steampunk, mechanical insect, photorealistic 3D render, high detail, intricate.\n\n**Composition:** The bee is positioned slightly off-center, flying diagonally across the frame, filling most of the vertical space. The perspective is eye-level, slightly below the bee, giving it a majestic and imposing feel.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are emerald green, metallic gold, and dark grey/black for the background and some mechanical parts. Accents of dark purple in the eyes.\n\n**Lighting:** Studio lighting, emphasizing the metallic sheen and details. There are strong highlights on the metallic surfaces, indicating light sources from the top-front. Subtle shadows are cast by the wings and legs, adding depth.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Futuristic yet vintage, sophisticated, highly technical, and precise.\n\n**Text/Logo:** In the bottom right corner, there is a golden, embossed alphanumeric logo \"c29\" with vertical stripes, adding a branded or artistic signature element.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Wings subtly ripple, antennas twitch minimally, and golden abdominal bands gently pulse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive wing unfurling, veins crackling with energy, antennas whip violently in a chaotic dance, the metallic abdomen bands pulsate with rhythmic force, glowing intensely. Gears grind fiercely, legs thrash, creating a dynamic, almost electrical hum that fills the air. A surge of power propels it forward in an erratic, unstoppable flight.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Golden wing veins dissolve into shimmering stardust, scattering across the void. Antennae stretch infinitely, threading through constellations. Abdomen bands unfurl into liquid gold ribbons, coiling and uncoiling to reveal miniature, swirling galaxies within. Legs become crystalline stalactites, growing upwards, rooting into an unseen sky as the bee phases through hyper-dimensional planes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The robotic bee hovers, its delicate wing membranes subtly rippling as golden light catches them. A slight antenna twitch signals unseen data acquisition. As it descends, the gold bands on its abdomen pulsate with a soft, rhythmic glow, revealing intricate inner mechanisms in a dramatic close-up before the camera sweeps wide to reveal its full, powerful form.",
