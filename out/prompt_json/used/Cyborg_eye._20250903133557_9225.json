Reflective geometric shapes in background slowly drift and refract light, while small white cubes subtly shift position.",
  "image_prompt": "A futuristic and surreal vertical image featuring a hyper-realistic, elaborate, silver robotic eye. The iris contains a detailed rendition of Van Gogh's \"The Starry Night,\" with bright turquoise light emanating from the metallic casing. A translucent, shimmering fiber optic tube loops around the eye. The dark background features floating, reflective, iridescent geometric shapes and small white cubes. Dramatic lighting emphasizes the metallic gleam and vibrant colors, exploring themes of art, technology, and perception.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "\"Pulsating metallic structure encircling the eye glows with shifting turquoise light. The iris's vibrant, Starry Night-like patterns intensely swirl, brightening and dynamically re-forming. A shimmering translucent tube contains continuously drifting and subtly coalescing particles. In the background, reflective geometric shapes slowly drift, continuously refracting and distorting light, as small white cubes subtly shift their positions and orientations.\""
