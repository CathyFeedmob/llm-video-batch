    "video_prompt": "A subtle and slow zoom out, the woman's lips softly part as if about to sigh, her chest gently rises and falls with a breath. Her hair and the skirt of her dress sway gently as if in a light breeze. The small, orange leaves and tendrils of smoke drift and twirl around her and the large, translucent sphere behind her. The subtle light in the sphere flickers softly.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, full-body portrait of a beautiful woman standing in a whimsical, mystical setting. She has long, flowing dark brown hair that appears to be gently lifted by the wind, with hints of subtle curls and wisps. Her eyes are closed, and her face holds a serene, peaceful expression, with natural-looking makeup, including defined eyelashes and soft lips. She is wearing a flowing, strappy teal or turquoise dress that billows around her lower body, creating a sense of movement and grace. The dress has delicate straps and a low V-neckline.\n\nIn the background, a large, ethereal full moon or celestial orb dominates the upper center, rendered in shades of glowing teal and light blue, with subtle concentric patterns and swirling light within it. Two prominent, vibrant orange roses float on either side of the woman, with distinct petals and a slightly surreal quality, connected to wispy, dark tendrils that intertwine with the woman's hair and the surrounding elements.\n\nThe foreground features abstract elements reminiscent of waves or flowing fabric in shades of deep teal, blue, and white, giving the impression of clouds, mist, or soft rolling hills. Scattered throughout the scene are small, fallen orange or brown leaves, adding a touch of autumnal atmosphere. The overall color palette is dominated by cool blues and teals, contrasting with the warm orange of the roses and leaves. The lighting is soft and ambient, emanating from the celestial body, creating a dreamlike and fantastical atmosphere with a painted or digital art aesthetic.\n\nThe composition is vertical, emphasizing the woman's figure and the grand scale of the moon, with a sense of depth created by the foreground elements. The style should be reminiscent of a refined digital painting or illustration, with smooth gradients and attention to detail on textures and light.\n\nVisual elements: Serene woman with flowing dark hair, ethereal teal moon/orb, two large orange roses, abstract blue/teal wave-like foreground, floating orange leaves.\nStyle: Digital painting, fantastical, whimsical, dreamlike, high resolution.\nComposition: Full-body portrait, vertical, central subject, balanced elements.\nColors: Dominant teal/blue, contrasting orange, white accents.\nLighting: Soft ambient light from the moon, subtle glow.\nAtmosphere: Mystical, peaceful, magical, serene.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The camera smoothly pulls back, as her lips subtly part, a soft sigh almost escaping. Her chest rhythmically rises and falls with each breath. Hair and dress fabric gently ripple in an unseen draft. Tiny, orange leaves and tendrils of smoke dance and spiral around her, echoing the gentle flicker of light within the large, translucent sphere behind her.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The sphere behind the woman pulsates violently, casting erratic light! Large orange roses explode from the ground, their petals scattering like shrapnel. The woman's hair whips around her in a furious gale, her dress morphing into crashing waves, engulfing the landscape. Tendrils of smoke coil and strike like serpents, tearing through the scene! Leaves burst forth, swirling into a raging vortex. Mountains shatter, revealing glowing caverns beneath!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's lips melt into blossoms as her chest warps into a glowing orb, defying gravity. Her hair transforms into flowing water, swirling around the immense sphere that pulsates with shifting dimensions. Orange leaves become shimmering fish that swim upwards, while tendrils of smoke transform into musical notes drifting into a void. The sphere's light solidifies into crystal formations, growing and then shattering into a stardust shower.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera subtly zooms out from the woman's face, her lips softly parting as if to sigh. Her chest gently rises and falls with a deep breath as the camera sweeps down, revealing her hair and dress swaying in a gentle breeze. Orange leaves and tendrils of smoke gracefully drift and twirl, encircling her as the camera pivots to track the soft flicker of light within the translucent sphere behind her, creating an ethereal dance of light and shadow.",
