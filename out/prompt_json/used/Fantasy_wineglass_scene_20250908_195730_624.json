    "video_prompt": "Subtle light flickering in house windows, gentle water ripples on the lake surface inside the glass, faint mist rising from the waterfalls, slight shimmering on the glass surface, and delicate swaying of leaves on the trees.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA surreal and dreamy wide shot of a giant, clear wine glass in the foreground, acting as a portal to a miniature enchanting fantasy village. The glass itself contains a detailed world: above the liquid line, charming, multi-story cottages with warm glowing windows and pointed roofs are nestled among evergreen trees and spired castles, bathed in the soft glow of a low sun or moon. Below the visible liquid surface, a stunning optical illusion of a downward spiral staircase, carved into the glass's interior, leads to a reflective pool and distant waterfalls and rocky bluffs seen through the curved glass. The \"liquid\" in the glass appears as a calm, reflective body of water with subtle ripples and dripping moss from the underside of the 'landmass'.\n\nThe background outside the glass reveals a larger, complementary landscape of dramatic, mist-shrouded mountain cliffs and vibrant blue waterfalls cascading into a valley. There are also hints of other cozy, illuminated cottages at the base of the scene, mirroring the style within the glass. The foreground features a rustic, cobbled or stone pathway and a small, inviting cottage with a balcony and glowing windows, leading to the base of the wine glass.\n\n**Visual Elements:** Giant wine glass, miniature fantasy village, cottages, castles, evergreen trees, water, spiral staircase, reflective pool, waterfalls, mountain cliffs, cobbled path, glowing windows.\n\n**Style:** Surrealism, fantasy art, illustrative, intricate detail, dreamlike.\n\n**Composition:** Central focus on the wine glass, strong vertical lines balanced by the horizontal landmass within the glass. Layered depth with foreground, midground (glass), and background. Symmetric feel with details on both sides of the glass.\n\n**Colors:** Rich earth tones (brown, rust, moss green) for buildings and foliage, deep blues and turquoises for water and distant mountains, warm yellows and oranges for lighting, soft sky blues and creamy whites for the sky.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, ethereal glow from a low celestial body (sun/moon), warm light spilling from cottage windows, gentle reflections on water surfaces and the glass itself. Subtle atmospheric haze in the distance.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Enchanting, mystical, peaceful, wondrous, inviting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle light flickers from the house windows, rippling water on the lake in the foreground, faint mist rising from distant waterfalls, shimmering glass surfaces, and gently swaying leaves on the trees.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Shattering glass cracks and explodes outwards. Buildings violently erupt from the ground, twisting and reforming. Water crashes upwards in powerful geysers, engulfing structures. Trees wildly thrash, tearing through the landscape. Molten light pulses from windows, incinerating anything in its path. The entire scene pulsates with destructive, chaotic energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Houses gently levitate inside the glass, their windows emitting a cosmic shimmer as light pulses. Water from the lake inside the glass defies gravity, forming upside-down waterfalls that flow into an ethereal void. The glass surface refracts light into impossible spectral colors that dance and bleed. Tree leaves crystallize then dissolve into stardust, only to reform anew. The entire scene pulsates, as if breathing, within a warping time loop.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic crane shot descends, revealing a vast wine glass housing a fantastical micro-village. Subtle light flickers in the quaint windows. The camera glides down, revealing gentle ripples on the water's surface, reflecting a faint mist rising from the cascaded waterfalls inside. A character emerges from a house, casting a long shadow, as sunlight shimmers across the glass, emphasizing the surreal, contained world.",
