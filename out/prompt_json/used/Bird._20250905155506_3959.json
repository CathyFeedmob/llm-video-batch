  "refined_video_prompt": "A bird soars, its form sweeping through a subtly shifting, luminous white expanse. Light continually glints and shimmers across its moving surface. Dynamic diamond flecks rapidly materialize and swirl along its flight path, intensely concentrating. They culminate, bursting into a radiant starburst directly from its actively gripping talons."
