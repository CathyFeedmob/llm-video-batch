    "video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom out, gentle swaying of the holographic fabric, faint shimmer on the metallic elements of the dress, slight glow and flicker of the blue lines on the skin, subtle rise and fall of the chest indicating breathing, eyes subtly blinking.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body shot of an ethereal character, female, with very pale skin and luminous, light blue eyes. She has short, silvery-white hair styled into a neat bob with subtle waves and a few delicate strands framing her face. A small, glowing blue symbol is visible on her forehead, and faint, glowing blue cybernetic lines or circuitry patterns are subtly visible on her chest, arms, and legs, suggesting an android or futuristic being.\n\nShe is wearing a highly futuristic and iridescent dress that reflects a spectrum of holographic colors, including blues, pinks, purples, and greens. The dress features a structured, metallic silver bodice with geometric cutouts and a crisscross design, creating a corset-like appearance. The shoulders are adorned with sharp, wing-like silver embellishments. The sleeves are large, puffy, and translucent with a similar iridescent sheen, cinched at the wrists with metallic cuffs. The skirt is multilayered, featuring a shorter, structured iridescent layer over a pleated, shimmering silver mini-skirt, with a longer, flowing, asymmetrical iridescent overlay. The dress has a slightly structured, almost angular silhouette.\n\nHer hands are gracefully posed, with long, slender fingers and sharp, black painted nails. She wears a simple silver bracelet on her left wrist and a silver ring on the ring finger of her right hand.\n\nThe setting is a dark, atmospheric performance stage or futuristic environment. The background is predominantly dark and smoky, with strong, focused spotlights casting bright, cool white and subtle blue light from above, creating dramatic highlights and shadows, particularly on the iridescent surfaces of the dress and the character's skin. There are visible lens flares from the stage lights. The overall lighting is high-contrast and dramatic, emphasizing the metallic and iridescent textures. The mood is futuristic, elegant, and slightly mysterious.\n\n**Art Style & Aesthetics:**\n\n*   **Anime/Manga influence with realistic rendering:** Detailed facial features, expressive eyes, and a sleek, stylized appearance.\n*   **Sci-fi/Cyberpunk:** Incorporating futuristic fashion elements and subtle cybernetic details.\n*   **Iridescent/Holographic effects:** Emphasis on the light-reflecting properties of the dress.\n*   **High-detail, photorealistic textures for materials.**\n*   **Soft depth of field, with the character in sharp focus.**\n\n**Key Elements to Emphasize:**\n\n*   Iridescent material of the dress (holographic/rainbow sheen).\n*   Structured silver elements on the dress.\n*   Glowing blue cybernetic lines on the body.\n*   Ethereal quality of the character's skin and hair.\n*   Dramatic stage lighting with hot spots and smoke.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom out reveals the holographic fabric gently swaying, its metallic elements faintly shimmering. Blue lines on the skin subtly glow and flicker, mimicking the soft rise and fall of her chest as she breathes. Her eyes blink subtly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Scales shimmer explosively outward from the dress's metallic elements, rapidly transforming into razor-sharp wings that beat erratically. Bioluminescent blue lines on her skin flare, then crackle with electric energy, spreading like wildfire. Her head snaps back, eyes flashing with an unearthly glow, as her body distorts with sudden, convulsive movements. The iridescent fabric of her dress whips violently, forming chaotic, swirling vortices around her. Fingers twitch, claws extending with a sharp, metallic screech.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The iridescent fabric ripples inward, consuming light as gravity reverses, pulling the dress upwards. Metallic elements twist and dissolve into floating, crystalline shards that reconstruct themselves. Blue lines on her skin pulse with bioluminescence, morphing into swirling glyphs that detach and orbit her. Her chest expands impossibly, revealing a void that subtly blinks with starlight. Her eyes become infinite kaleidoscopes, her gaze warping the very stage.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms in on the character's face, revealing sparkling blue eyes and subtle blinks. A sharp, sweeping movement follows the iridescent dress as it shimmers and sways, reflecting intense light. The glow on her skin pulsates with a dramatic flicker, hinting at an internal energy. Her chest rises and falls, a silent, almost defiant breath as the camera slowly pulls back, revealing her poised posture under a shifting spotlight that intensifies the scene, ending with a lingering gaze and sudden, decisive step forward.",
