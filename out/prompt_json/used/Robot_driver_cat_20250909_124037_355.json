    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A young woman with short black hair, wearing a sleek, futuristic metallic dark grey and blue-glowing cybernetic suit that covers her entire body. She is seated in the driver's seat of an advanced, possibly autonomous, vehicle. Next to her, on the passenger seat or console, is a cute, large grey tabby cat looking slightly upwards.\n\n**Composition:** Medium full shot, from the front-right passenger perspective, looking towards the driver and the road ahead. The vehicle interior fills the bottom half of the frame. The driver is positioned slightly to the left, and the cat is prominently visible on the right. The large front windshield and panoramic sunroof dominate the upper portion, revealing the sci-fi landscape.\n\n**Setting:** Inside a futuristic vehicle with a spacious, minimalist interior featuring dark, smooth metallic surfaces and subtle blue internal lighting accents. The driver's console is a large, integrated screen displaying a holographic blue navigation map and data.\n\n**Background:** Through the windshield and sunroof: a vast, alien planet with a prominent, large, spherical orbital station with a nuclear symbol (or similar sci-fi emblem) visible against its surface, filling the upper sky. Below, a long, wide, empty futuristic runway or road extends into the distance, leading to a large, disc-shaped futuristic city or complex with glowing windows. The sky is a deep space blue with faint stars visible, and the planet glows with a soft, ethereal light.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:** Soft, diffused light from the large screens and internal vehicle elements, combined with the bright, glowing light from the distant planet and city. The overall atmosphere is futuristic, serene, and slightly mysterious, blending a sense of advanced technology with a touch of domesticity (the cat).\n\n**Style:** Photorealistic with a strong emphasis on sci-fi aesthetics and intricate detail, especially in the cybernetic suit and vehicle interior. Sharp focus on the foreground subjects (woman and cat) and a slightly softer focus on the distant background elements. High resolution.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant cool tones: dark greys, blues (holographic displays, glowing accents), and the planet's light. Touches of amber/yellow in the background city lights and some internal vehicle elements. The cat provides a contrasting soft grey and cream.\n\n**Keywords:** cybernetic suit, futuristic vehicle, sci-fi interior, panoramic sunroof, alien planet, orbital station, holographic map, grey tabby cat, high-tech, precise, detailed, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, cyberpunk, advanced technology, spacious cockpit.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle breeze ripples driver's hair and clothing. Driver's suit elements gently pulse. Cat's tail twitches. Holographic map subtly shimmers and updates. Camera drifts and zooms out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The driver's hair and suit metallic components violently whip and spark with chaotic energy. The cat leaps and snarls, its tail thrashing like a whip. The holographic map erupts into a blinding maelstorm of glitching data, warping and distorting the dashboard. The futuristic city beyond the window buckles and tears as the planet in the sky pulsates and ruptures.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The celestial sphere above shatters into iridescent dust, gravitationally pulling the driver, car, and cat upwards, while the road below folds into an Escherian landscape. The driver's suit becomes liquid mercury, flowing to form wings, as the cat's tail elongates into a serpentine sky-bridge. The holographic map morphs into a constellation of singing galaxies, each note echoing in the reversed time, causing the driver's hair to un-grow into starlight.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A panoramic sky shot of Earth from the spaceport slowly zooms out, revealing a futuristic car. Inside, an elaborate zoom into the driver's determined face, then a dramatic 360-degree rotation around the cabin, highlighting the glow of her suit and the pulsating map. The cat’s tail twitches, a subtle whip pan to the expansive runway, hinting at high-speed motion, as the car's engine barely hums.",
