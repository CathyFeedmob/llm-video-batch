  "refined_video_prompt": "A figure strides away, their form receding, as a swinging lantern's light bobs. The arched corridor continually stretches further, its walls appearing to recede. Blue roses along the path dynamically brighten and dim, responding to the lantern's passing illumination. The distant corridor end's glow intensifies, progressively drawing the figure forward."
