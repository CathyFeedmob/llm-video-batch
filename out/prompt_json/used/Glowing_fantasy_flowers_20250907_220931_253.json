    "video_prompt": "The glowing starlight on the large flowers flickers gently. Tiny, luminous particles drift upwards from the flower petals and stamen. The leaves on the large flower stems and in the background trees sway softly. The clothing of the walking figures ripples slightly with their movement and a subtle breeze. Hints of glimmering light shift across the path and the surrounding small flowers. A very subtle slow zoom out and pan sideways as if following the walking people.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA magical surreal forest at night, filled with giant, glowing fantasy flowers. The dominant flowers are lotus-like, with shimmering petals in gradients of purple, fuchsia, blue, orange, and red, emanating bright, warm light from their centers. Tiny, sparkling stars and glowing specks adorn the petals and the dark, starry sky above. Large, gnarled tree trunks frame the sides of the path, with dark green leaves. A group of people dressed in traditional, flowing Asian robes (kimono/hanfu style) walk along a winding, sun-dappled dirt path, their backs to the viewer, entering deeper into the enchanting forest. The path is lined with an abundance of colorful, smaller, vibrant flowers and lush foliage in shades of red, orange, fuchsia, purple, and blue. The overall atmosphere is ethereal, mystical, and peaceful.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Flowers:** Giant, lotus-like fantasy flowers as the main subjects, smaller colorful flowers lining the path.\n*   **Trees:** Dark, sturdy tree trunks with green foliage.\n*   **Path:** Winding dirt path.\n*   **People:** A group of figures in traditional robes walking.\n*   **Sky:** Dark, starry night sky.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Surrealism, fantasy art.\n*   Highly detailed, illustrative.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Eye-level perspective.\n*   Foreground features the start of the path and the initial giant flowers.\n*   Midground shows the group of people and more giant flowers leading into the distance.\n*   Background is a deeper part of the magical forest with more distant glowing flowers and trees.\n*   Rule of thirds applied with the giant flowers and the path leading the eye.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Rich purples, fuchsias, blues, oranges, reds (for flowers).\n*   **Accents:** Golden yellow (flower centers), dark greens/browns (trees), various vibrant hues for smaller flowers.\n*   **Sky:** Deep indigo to black with bright white/yellow stars.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Source:** Internal glow from the large flowers.\n*   **Effect:** Ethereal, soft, warm light illuminating the immediate surroundings of the flowers.\n*   **Ambient:** Dark night, moonlit or starlit sky.\n*   **Highlights:** Shimmering star-like specks on petals, subtle dappled light on the path from the flower glow.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Magical, enchanting, mystical, serene, mysterious, dreamlike, wondrous.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle, undulating glow on large flowers. Minute, luminous flecks ascend from petals. Gentle swaying in foliage of foreground and background trees. Rippling of clothing on walking figures. Shifting light reflections across path and small flowers. Very gradual outward zoom with a continuous lateral pan.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Giant flowers *violently* pulse, *exploding* starlight upward in *blinding* bursts. Leaves *whip* around like frantic wings as trees *twist* and *lurch*. Figures *lunge* forward, their clothes *erupting* with a sudden, *howling* gale. The path *fractures* and *heaves*, while smaller flowers *ignite* with *flickering* energy, then *collapse*. The scene *violently* pans and zooms, a *chaotic*, *disorienting* rush.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity's embrace untangles, as glowing flowers ascend, their petals unfurling into swirling cosmic dust. Figures, luminous and ethereal, shimmer into existence from the path's ripples, their robes flowing like liquid light, twisting and merging with the blossoming ground. Trees bend as if inhaling stars, their leaves now sentient constellations. The path, a ribbon of pure energy, dances upwards, revealing a sky not above, but within, where entire galaxies bloom from the smallest stamen.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly zooms out, revealing the grand scale of the glowing flowers, their ethereal light pulsating with increasing intensity. The walking figures pause, one turning slightly as glimmering particles rise dramatically, swirling around them. A gentle breeze becomes a gust, making the large flower petals shimmer more brightly and the leaves on the trees sway wildly, casting dancing shadows. The path shimmers underfoot, catching reflections of the otherworldly light.",
