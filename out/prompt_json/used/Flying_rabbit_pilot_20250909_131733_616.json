    "image_prompt": "A vibrant painting in a unique whimsical cartoon style, featuring a detailed anthropomorphic bunny pilot commanding a vintage biplane. The bunny wears goggles and a flight jacket, peering out from the cockpit with an energetic expression. The biplane, a richly detailed model with visibly rusted parts and the British Royal Air Force roundel on its wing, flies low over a churning, waves-filled ocean. Below, a realistic, detailed grey battleship, also showing signs of wear and rust, cuts through the water, leaving a trail of white foam and dark smoke. The sky is a bright, clear blue with soft white clouds, reflecting in the vivid blue of the rough sea. The composition uses a low-angle shot on the plane and a dynamic diagonal perspective for the ship, enhancing the sense of movement and scale. The lighting is sunny and natural, creating clear shadows and highlights that emphasize the textures of the plane and ship. On the top left, the words \"AI生成\" are faintly visible, and on the bottom right, the characters \"c29\" are present in a bold, handwritten style. The overall atmosphere is adventurous and playful, blending historical elements with an imaginative, charming character.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Movements:** The biplane's propeller rapidly spins, and the rabbit's ears sway with the wind. Its jacket subtly flaps. The battleship gently bobs, surrounded by cresting, foaming waves, and smoke billows from its funnels. Distant clouds drift. The camera subtly tracks the biplane's forward motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A rabbit in a biplane performs a shocking, gravity-defying barrel roll, its propeller spinning into a blur. The rabbit's ears wildly whip and contort, its jacket tearing as it executes erratic, lightning-fast maneuvers. Below, the battleship violently lurches and twists, its funnels erupting with aggressive, leaping smoke plumes. Waves surge into colossal, sentient walls of water, crashing explosively while the clouds rapidly morph and swirl into menacing vortexes. The camera lunges and dives, mirroring the plane's impossible, chaotic trajectory.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The rabbit-pilot transmutes into a flock of biplanes, each dissolving into a storm of feathers as they pass the battleship. The battleship, in turn, liquefies into a crashing wave of molten metal, then solidifies into a floating mountain range. Clouds cascade upwards, transforming into shimmering fish that swim the sky. The sea itself churns into a vortex of singing, crystalline hands. Gravity reverses, twisting the entire scene into an Escherian dance of impossible perspective.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A determined rabbit pilot in a vintage biplane dive-bombs past a formidable battleship. The plane, buffeted by wind, banks sharply, its rotating propeller blurring. The rabbit's goggles gleam, ears twitching in the wind, a confident smirk playing on its lips. Below, the battleship plows through choppy seas, its hull occasionally obscured by spray. Smoke plumes from its funnels, twisting dramatically upwards. The camera sweeps from the plane's exhilarating dive to a close-up of the ship, then pulls back to reveal the vast ocean, before following the plane's ascent into the cloud-streaked sky.",
