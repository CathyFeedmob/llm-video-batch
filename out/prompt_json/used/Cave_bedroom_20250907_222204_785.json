    "video_prompt": "The gentle lapping of waves against the cliff below, a subtle shimmer on the water's surface. Distant seabirds glide across the sky. The warm glow from the recessed lights in the cave ceiling softly pulsates. Sunlight subtly shifts, casting shifting shadows from the balcony railing across the floor.",
    "image_prompt": "A breathtaking interior view of a luxury hotel room built into a natural cave overlooking the ocean. The room features a modern minimalist aesthetic with a king-size bed, a comfortable sofa seating area, and a separate dining/reading nook. The organic rock formations of the cave ceiling and walls are exposed, contrasting with the smooth, light-colored wooden wall for the interior structure and the light gray tiled floor. The cave features several recessed warm lights in the ceiling, as well as wall sconces and table lamps providing ambient light.\n\nOne side of the cave opens up to a wide semi-circular balcony with a metal railing, offering panoramic views of the deep blue ocean and rugged cliffs covered in green vegetation. Sunlight streams onto the balcony and the floor of the room, creating strong shadows from the railing. In the distance, there are two distinct, minimalist platform structures extending over the water. The sky is bright blue with a few scattered white clouds.\n\n**Visual elements:** Natural cave interior, modern minimalist furniture, luxury hotel feel, ocean view, cliffs, balcony with railing, recessed lighting, wall sconces, table lamps, platform structures over water.\n**Style:** Modern, luxurious, organic, minimalist.\n**Composition:** Wide and open, showcasing both the interior and the exterior view, leading lines from the railing towards the ocean.

    "refined_video_prompt": "Waves gently lap, water shimmers. Distant seabirds glide. Recessed lights softly pulsate. Sunlight subtly shifts, casting moving shadows. Human expressions and background alterations are not present in the original prompt.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The cliff face violently cracks, sending boulders plummeting into a raging sea. A tidal wave surges, smashing against the cave, as the balcony tears free and plunges into the churning abyss. Recessed lights explode, showering sparks. The bed levitates, spinning wildly, as the floor tiles shatter and reform. Furniture contorts, stretching into grotesque shapes. Lightning flashes, illuminating the chaos. The entire cave pulsates with raw, untamed energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cave walls breathe, slowly contracting and expanding, the recessed lights within them swirling like galaxies. The sea below morphs into a liquid mirror, reflecting an inverted sky where fish-birds swim through clouds. The balcony railing slithers, its metallic form dissolving into a cascade of bioluminescent liquid, pouring upwards from the water. Shadows dance independently, weaving impossible patterns as the floor softly undulates. Objects on the tables gently levitate, spinning in shimmering auroras.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow pan reveals the expansive cave mouth and dramatic ocean cliff. The camera tightens on the shimmering water, then rapidly swivels to the ceiling as recessed lights pulsate intensely, casting dynamic shadows down the cave walls. A sweeping crane shot suddenly reveals the bedroom, then pulls back to showcase the entire cliffside balcony, with the sun dramatically striking the railing and casting elongated, dancing shadows across the floor.",
