    "video_prompt": "Subtle rain streaking down, umbrella glistening with raindrops, gentle sway of hair, soft flicker of distant lanterns, reflections in the wet ground ripple slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "A beautiful, thin woman with an umbrella, dark hair, wearing a loose black leather coat and carrying a black backpack, stands facing right in a close-up outdoor street portrait. The scene is set in an alleyway during a rainy night with glowing signs and lanterns in the background. She holds the umbrella in front of her body with both hands. The woman's face is in profile, gazing into the distance with a serious expression and soft, rosy lips. Her hair is tied back in a neat bun with bangs across her forehead. The umbrella has water droplets on it. The street is wet and reflective, showing the blurred lights from the buildings. In the background, out-of-focus figures walk past. The overall atmosphere is moody and serene.\n\n**Art Style:** Anime-inspired, realistic, moody lighting.\n**Camera:** DSLR camera, shallow depth of field, 85mm lens.\n**Lighting:** Soft, ambient lights from lanterns and signs, creating reflections on the wet ground.\n**Color palette:** Muted blues, grays, and blacks, with pops of warm orange and red from the lights.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle rain streaks down. Umbrella glistens, drops slide. Hair sways gently. Distant lanterns flicker softly. Wet ground ripples with reflections.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rain lashes, umbrella violently whips, hair whips, distant lanterns explode into bursts of light, ground rips open with raging water, shadows writhe into monstrous forms, the entire alley shudders and collapses, reality itself tears apart.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Raindrops defy gravity, shimmering upward into the umbrella, which gently pulls the user skyward. Lantern glows pulsate, stretching into elongated streams of light. Reflections on the wet ground shimmer with impossible non-Newtonian fluid dynamics, briefly forming ephemeral, glowing portals that open and close, revealing glimpses of other, parallel rainy streets. Her hair flows like liquid silk, undulating with an unseen current.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle shot tracks the woman's determined stride through the downpour, raindrops shimmering on her umbrella. The camera slowly dollies in as she glances back, a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes. As the wind picks up, her coat subtly billows, revealing the vibrant reflections of distant lanterns on the soaked street. The camera pushes past her, revealing the blurred silhouettes of people hurrying by, their movements distorted by the rain. A lone lantern sways gently in the background, its light momentarily illuminating a ripple in a puddle.",
