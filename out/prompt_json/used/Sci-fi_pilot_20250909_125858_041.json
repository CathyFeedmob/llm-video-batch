    "video_prompt": "Two figures in a dark, high-tech environment. The top figure, a woman in a sci-fi suit, appears to be in mid-air, with her hair subtly swaying and her suit's glowing elements gently pulsing. Her right arm extends towards a small, glowing object that drifts slightly.\n\nThe camera subtly glides forward and slightly downwards, enhancing the sense of motion. In the foreground, the back of another figure in a similar suit is visible, their helmet's lights subtly blinking.\n\nIn the background, the mechanical structures show very subtle, almost imperceptible shifts, as if humming with power. Small, indistinct debris or particles very slowly drift and shimmer in the dark, upper areas, reflecting faint light. There's a minimal, shimmering effect on the bright, reflective surface below, suggesting very slight air currents or heat haze where it meets the ground.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on recreating the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFuturistic combat scene, dynamic, high-octane. A female anime-style character, sharp features, long dark hair in motion, wearing a sleek, dark sci-fi exosuit with glowing teal and orange accents, is suspended mid-air. Her left arm is extended, reaching for a glowing long-barrelled energy weapon. Her body is angled, suggesting upward motion and agility. Prominent in the foreground, from a lower angle, is the back of another character in a similar, darker exosuit, with a full helmet featuring a blue visor and bright green glowing elements. The perspective is a wide-angle, slightly distorted fisheye lens effect looking up from the foreground character.\n\nThe environment is a cavernous, dark, industrial sci-fi interior, with metallic structures, visible pipes, wires, and glowing square panel lights from above, suggesting a starship or complex facility. Below the mid-air character is a brightly lit, white, reflective floor or surface, possibly an ice-like material, with subtle glints and reflections. The background shows hints of mechanical debris or structures, with a subtle blue haze.\n\n**Art Style:** Anime, sci-fi concept art, highly rendered, digital painting, sharp details, clean lines.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic, high contrast, strong backlighting from the unknown top source, casting some silhouette on the main character's left side. Glowing elements on the suits provide self-illumination. The bright white floor reflects light upwards.\n**Colors:** Predominantly dark blues, blacks, grays, with vibrant teal, electric blue, and warm orange accents. Bright white floor.\n**Atmosphere:** Intense, action-packed, futuristic, sense of weightlessness or anti-gravity combat.\n\n**Additional considerations (if adaptable by model):**\n* Motion blur on the hair and weapon, suggesting rapid movement.\n* Subtle lens flares from light sources.\n* High resolution, intricate texture details on suits and environment.\n* The \"C29\" text faintly visible in the mid-ground, but not as a central element for recreation.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A hovering woman's hair subtly sways. Her suit's glowing elements gently pulse. Her extended arm follows a drifting, glowing object. The camera subtly glides forward and down. A foreground figure's helmet lights subtly blink. Background mechanical structures subtly hum with imperceptible shifts. Indistinct debris slowly drifts and shimmers. A minimal shimmering effect on the reflective surface below suggests slight air currents.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive energy rips through the high-tech environment! The woman in the sci-fi suit violently lurches, her hair flailing as her suit's glowing elements pulse intensely. The camera plunges forward and downwards, simulating a rapid dive. The foreground figure's helmet lights flash erratically, signifying alarm. Mechanical structures groan and twist suddenly, collapsing inward, as previously static debris explodes outward. The reflective ground beneath shatters, spewing razor-sharp shards upwards, battling gravity as the entire scene contorts in chaos!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman in her sci-fi suit floats upward as her hair crystallizes into starlight, the suit's glowing elements dissolving into a nebulae of color. The small, glowing object reverses trajectory, elongating into a shimmering serpent that wraps around her phasing arm. The camera flips, revealing the foreground figure’s helmet morphing into a sentient, pulsating orb that reflects an impossible inverted sky. In the background, mechanical structures ripple like liquid, solidifying and then flowing away, revealing a swirling void from which debris reforms into impossible geometries. The reflective surface below becomes a mirror of anti-gravity where time itself becomes a visible, swirling eddy.",
