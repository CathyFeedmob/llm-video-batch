    "video_prompt": "Subtle floating debris and dust particles drift across the ring and within the cityscape. The large blue moon pulses softly with an internal glow. Lights flicker gently from illuminated windows across the futuristic buildings. Water in the canal shimmers with subtle ripples and reflections. Flying vehicles and distant spaceships slowly traverse the sky. The camera subtly zooms in and out and pans across the scene.",
    "image_prompt": "An epic, highly detailed, vertical shot of a futuristic utopian city at night. The central focus is a massive ring-shaped structure in the sky, densely packed with buildings and greenery, encircling a luminous, pale blue moon. Below this ring, countless towering skyscrapers with intricate architectural details stretch into the distance, reflecting in a serene, reflective canal or body of water that winds through the city. Elevated walkways and bridges are bustling with tiny, silhouetted people, and flying vehicles (similar to hovercars and small UFO-like craft) populate the sky.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by cool blues, silvers, and whites, with warm accents from glowing windows and internal lights within the buildings. Lush green palm trees and flowering foliage are interspersed throughout the urban landscape, adding a touch of natural beauty. The lighting is dramatic and ethereal, with strong glowing points and reflections, creating a sense of wonder and advanced technology. The overall atmosphere is majestic, peaceful, and awe-inspiring, showcasing a harmonious blend of nature and advanced civilization. The composition uses a wide-angle lens perspective to capture the immense scale, with depth of field highlighting both the foreground activity and the distant city.\n\nStyle: Highly detailed, hyperrealistic, futuristic, fantastical, utopian.\nColors: Dominantly cool blues, silvers, whites, with glowing yellow/orange accents, and touches of green and pink from sparse vegetation.\nLighting: Ethereal and glowing, strong reflections on water and metallic surfaces, with dramatic contrast between illuminated and shadowed areas.\nAtmosphere: Majestic, peaceful, awe-inspiring, advanced, technological yet organic.\nComposition: Vertical shot, wide-angle lens, deep depth of field, leading lines from canals and walkways.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Debris and dust subtly drift. Blue moon softly pulses. Window lights gently flicker. Canal water shimmers with ripples and reflections. Vehicles and spaceships slowly traverse. Camera subtly zooms and pans.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Ring structures violently shudder, flinging debris. The moon erupts with blinding blue energy bursts. Buildings convulse, glass shattering as lights flicker erratically. Water in canals roars, surging upward into torrents. Flying vehicles dart erratically, colliding explosively. Distant spaceships zoom and vanish. Camera violently shakes, rapidly zooming then pulling back in a chaotic frenzy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The grand ring-city undulates, its buildings softly breathing like organisms, as the blue moon expands and contracts, revealing shimmering, impossible geometries within. Gravity selectively reverses for some vehicles, causing them to ascend into a reflective sky. Water flows upwards from the canals, forming liquid sculptures that reform into architectural elements. Distant spaceships spontaneously de-materialize into stardust, then reappear as organic flora on the ring. The scene continuously cycles through impossible states, defying all expectation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pulls back, revealing the vast ring-city under the ethereal blue moon, then swoops down to follow a lone, gleaming hovercar navigating the pulsating canal. Lights on skyscrapers twinkle faster, responding to a sudden surge of air traffic. A subtle tremor shakes the city, sending a ripple across the canal, hinting at an unseen power.",
