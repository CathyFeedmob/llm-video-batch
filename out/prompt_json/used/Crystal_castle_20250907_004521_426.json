    "video_prompt": "Bubbles drift and subtly reflect changing light, tiny sparkling particles gently float downwards, light within the castle flickers softly, light drips from the base of the castle sway gently, and the surrounding clouds subtly shift and undulate.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A majestic, ethereal castle made of light blue, translucent glass or crystal, floating amongst soft, pastel clouds in a dawn or dusk sky. The castle features multiple spires and intricate Gothic architectural details, with light seemingly emanating from within its many arches and windows, creating a warm, internal glow.\n\n**Composition:** The castle is centrally placed but slightly elevated, occupying the upper two-thirds of the image. Below the castle, forming its base, are several large, heart-shaped arrangements of blooming roses. From right to left, these hearts consist of: pink and light pink roses, white roses, and deep red roses. Numerous delicate, glowing light strings, resembling icicles or falling water droplets with embedded lights, suspend beneath the castle and the rose hearts, trailing downwards. Scattered around the castle and in the sky are iridescent bubbles of varying sizes, reflecting the soft light. Some bubbles are in the foreground, out of focus.\n\n**Style & Atmosphere:** Fantasy, dreamlike, romantic, whimsical. The style should be highly detailed and rendered with a soft, glowing, illustrative quality. The overall feeling is one of peace, love, and magic.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are pastel blues, purples, and pinks in the sky, with accents of white, deep red, and various shades of pink for the roses. The castle is a luminous, clear blue, while the lights within and hanging below are warm yellow and orange, contrasting with the cool tones of the sky. The bubbles display a full spectrum of iridescent colors.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused, and multi-directional. There's a subtle glow from the horizon line (implied dawn/dusk). The castle itself is self-illuminated. The hanging lights provide warm, point sources of light below the castle. Highlights are prominent on the reflective surfaces of the castle and bubbles.\n\n**Details:**\n* **Castle:** Sharp, defined edges of crystal, with intricate tracery in the windows and arches. Internal light source creating a captivating glow.\n* **Roses:** Detailed, full blooms arranged tightly to form distinct heart shapes.\n* **Hanging Lights:** Delicate, transparent strands with bright, warm glowing points. Long, thin, and visually appealing.\n* **Bubbles:** Highly reflective, showing refractions and highlights from scattered light sources. Varying sizes and distances.\n* **Sky/Clouds:** Smooth gradients of color, gentle and soft clouds providing a cushion-like base for the castle and adding depth.\n\n**Artistic Effects:** Bokeh effect on far background elements and some foreground bubbles. Subtle luminous dust or glitter particles scattered in the air around the castle and bubbles. Lens flare present on close-up bubbles adding to the ethereal quality.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Bubbles drift and shimmer. Glittering motes cascade. Castle lights pulsate softly. Hanging lights sway. Clouds undulate gently.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Bubbles violently surge and burst, casting blinding flashes; a maelstrom of sparkling particles erupts upwards. The crystal castle shatters and rebuilds with explosive force, its light pulses with searing intensity, and dripping lights whip like frenzied chains. Clouds churn into a raging vortex, engulfing the scene in a tempest of dramatic, rapid chaos.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Crystal castle spires ripple like water; luminous hearts composed of roses unfurl, their petals becoming iridescent bubbles that drift upwards, catching falling starlight which then solidifies into impossible, sparkling rain. Chains of light, like inverted stalactites, grow upwards from the castle base, pulling the structure higher. Surrounding clouds melt into kaleidoscopic trails of color, consumed by the rising bubbles, as gravity intermittently reverses for the castle and the ascending rain.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Camera descends through ethereal bubbles, revealing a crystalline castle. It dramatically tracks past glistening spires, pulling back to a sweeping view of the rose hearts, now gracefully rotating. Lights within the castle pulsate, illuminating shifting clouds as the camera majestically pulls back, showing the floating fortress ascend through the shimmering, star-dusted sky.",
