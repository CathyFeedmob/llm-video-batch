    "video_prompt": "Long dark hair subtly swaying and blowing across the face, slight flickering in the distant overhead lights, and very subtle motion blur on the people in the background, implying their movement.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   A young East Asian woman, approximately 20-30 years old, with long, straight, dark hair, dramatically blown across her face, partially obscuring her left eye.\n*   She wears a light-colored (possibly white or light blue) long-sleeved shirt, appearing somewhat translucent or flowing due to movement.\n*   Her expression is calm and direct, with a slight hint of vulnerability or intrigue. Her lips are subtly tinted red.\n*   In the background, a bustling modern walkway or tunnel with numerous blurred figures (people) moving in various directions, suggesting a busy urban environment.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Medium close-up shot of the woman, with her upper body and head occupying the left and center-bottom portion of the frame.\n*   Her gaze is directed almost straight into the camera, establishing a direct connection with the viewer.\n*   The background features a strong sense of depth and perspective, with lines converging towards the far end of the walkway.\n*   The rule of thirds is subtly applied, with her eyes roughly positioned on the upper-left intersection.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Dynamic and evocative, with a strong sense of motion blur, particularly in the background figures and the woman's shirt/hair, creating a feeling of speed and energy.\n*   Fashion photography aesthetic, focusing on the model and her interaction with the environment.\n*   Slightly cinematic feel due to lighting and depth.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Dominant cool tones: Teal/blue-green hues in the background structure, contrasting with the warmer skin tones of the woman.\n*   Neutral colors for clothing (white/light).\n*   Subtle pops of orange/warm light bokeh in the distant background.\n*   Overall color palette is subdued yet rich, with a slightly desaturated or muted quality, giving it a dreamlike or artistic feel.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Soft, diffused natural light or ambient studio lighting that mimics natural light.\n*   Backlighting or side lighting effects enhance the hair's movement and create subtle highlights.\n*   Bokeh lights in the far background suggest distant light sources (e.g., streetlights, shop lights).\n*   The lighting highlights the woman's face and hair, making her stand out from the blurred background.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Energetic and busy due to the motion blur and background crowd, yet surprisingly intimate and focused on the subject.\n*   A sense of movement and \"passing through\" an urban space.\n*   Intriguing and slightly mysterious due to the partially obscured face and direct gaze.\n*   Modern, urban, and slightly melancholic or contemplative.\n\n**Full Prompt:**\n\n\"A striking medium close-up portrait of a young East Asian woman (20-30s) standing amidst a bustling, motion-blurred urban walkway or tunnel. Her long, dark hair is dramatically windblown, partially obscuring her left eye, adding a dynamic effect. She wears a flowing, light-colored (white/light blue) shirt, exhibiting subtle motion blur. Her visible right eye gazes directly into the camera with a calm, intriguing expression, her lips tinted red. The background features numerous highly blurred figures moving in a cool-toned (teal/blue-green) architectural space, with lines converging towards the distance. Soft, diffused lighting illuminates her face, contrasting with the subdued, rich color palette. Bokeh effects from distant warm lights are visible. The overall style is a blend of dynamic fashion photography with a cinematic feel, conveying a sense of energetic urban movement and intimate focus.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Hair gently shifts, obscuring and revealing the face. Distant overhead lights subtly flicker. Background figures gain a soft motion blur, indicating subtle shifts and movement.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**DYNAMIC MOVEMENT:**  Her long, dark hair whips violently across her face, not swaying, but lunging and coiling with a sudden, supernatural energy. Distant overhead lights explode and flicker erratically, pulsing with aggressive strobing. The background figures blur into streaks of pure motion, not walking, but surging forward, then abruptly recoiling, as if pulled by an unseen, powerful force. A sudden, violent updraft of invisible air distorts the entire scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's long, dark hair, caught in an upward breeze, whips upwards from her face, revealing her eyes, while the distant crowd glides backwards in unison. The overhead lights flicker and transform into shimmering orbs, casting an ethereal glow. Her white shirt begins to ripple and dissolve into a ghostly mist as the entire scene gently floats skyward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A long, dramatic shot opens on a bustling corridor, people's subtly blurred forms rushing past. The camera slowly zooms in, tracking a mysterious figure with flowing dark hair. As the distant overhead lights flicker, her hair dramatically whips across her face, revealing intense eyes. The camera cuts quickly to a rapid, sweeping pan that follows her as she abruptly turns, her hair a chaotic blur, before settling on a close-up of her captivating gaze amidst the frenetic movement.",
