    "video_prompt": "A subtle camera pan left reveals a landscape consumed by fiery orange glows. Lightning flashes illuminate the stormy skyline, while the giant, dark creatures pulsed with faint red light. Smoke plumes rise from distant city buildings, and sparks of embers float through the air from the numerous fires. Soldiers' uniforms gently ripple in the heat, and their weapons gleam from the orange glow. The blue energy beam emanating from the distant forces subtly shimmers, adding a dynamic contrast to the fiery scene. The large \"29\" logo in the foreground subtly flashes, drawing attention.",
    "image_prompt": "A dramatic, wide-angle shot depicting an urban warzone at dusk. In the background, a sprawling cityscape is shrouded in warm and cool tones, silhouetted against a chaotic sky. The sky transitions from a soft, golden orange on the horizon to turbulent, dark blue and gray storm clouds overhead. Jagged, bright blue lightning flashes conspicuously from the dark clouds on the right side of the frame, illuminating areas with a cool, sharp light.\n\nThe midground features a battle-scarred cityscape with partially destroyed buildings and an elevated highway or bridge riddled with fire and smoke. Prominent power lines and transmission towers stretch across the scene, some damaged, adding to the desolate atmosphere. Masses of human soldiers, clad in dark, futuristic military gear, are seen marching or standing in formation, primarily on the left side of the frame. They are illuminated by an intense, electric blue light emanating horizontally from the far right, slicing through the scene like a laser beam.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, several large, monstrous, alien-like creatures with dark, spiky bodies and glowing red eyes dominate the foreground and midground. The largest of these creatures stands tall, bathed in a fiery red glow that contrasts with the blue light, suggesting an energy source or destructive power. Smaller versions of these creatures are also visible among the human forces, hinting at a large-scale conflict.\n\nThe foreground is littered with military tanks and armored vehicles, partially destroyed or abandoned, sitting amidst rubble and infernos. Intense, orange and red flames flicker across the ground, casting warm light and reflections, especially around the tanks and the base of the power lines. Debris, sparks, and glowing embers are scattered throughout the scene, adding to the sense of an ongoing battle. The overall composition is chaotic yet detailed, with a strong contrast between the cool blue and warm orange/red lighting, highlighting the clash between the human and alien forces. The mood is apocalyptic and intense.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, cinematic, dark fantasy, sci-fi action.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic contrast, cool blue energy, warm fire and sunset glow, lightning flashes.\n**Composition:** Wide-angle, dynamic, deep depth of field, leading lines from the blue energy and power lines.\n**Atmosphere:** Apocalyptic, destructive, intense, battle-scarred.\n**Colors:** Dominant dark grays and blues, stark contrast with brilliant blues, fiery oranges and reds, warm golden sky.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The camera subtly pans left. Lightning actively flashes across the stormy sky. Giant, dark creatures pulsate with faint red light. Smoke plumes dynamically rise.

    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A subtle camera pan left reveals a landscape consumed by fiery orange glows, flowing like lava uphill and igniting the clouds. Lightning flashes illuminate the stormy skyline, striking monsters who dissolve into shimmering smoke and reform as ethereal butterflies. Sparks of embers float downwards like reversed rain, merging into solid stone, while soldiers' uniforms gently ripple as if made of liquid light, morphing into other soldiers. The blue energy beam from distant forces shimmers, pulling tanks into the sky, where they unravel into ribbons of pure energy. The large \"29\" logo in the foreground subtly flashes, expanding into a portal that bends reality.",

Lightning flashes pierce the dark clouds as enormous, shadowy creatures emerge, their bodies pulsing with faint red light. Smoke billows from distant buildings and embers dance. Soldiers’ uniforms ripple, their weapons gleam. A dynamic blue energy beam shimmers, contrasting with the fiery chaos. The camera dramatically zooms in on the large \"29\" logo, which flashes intensely, adding a cinematic flourish.",
