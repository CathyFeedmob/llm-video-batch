    "video_prompt": "A subtle, rhythmic rise and fall of the chest indicating breathing. The strands of hair falling across the face gently sway. The light within the cybernetic implants subtly pulses and shifts, reflecting faintly on the adjacent skin. The vibrant colors in the eye subtly shimmer.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, aiming to recreate the original image with its specific visual style and atmosphere:\n\n**Detailed Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n\"Close-up portrait of a female cyborg, high detail, hyperrealistic, cyberpunk aesthetic. The subject's face is turned slightly to the right, with her striking, multi-colored (purple to orange) bionic eye as the focal point, glowing with an internal light. Her skin is fair, with subtle texture and light freckles, exhibiting a soft, luminous sheen as if lit by an internal glow or focused spotlight. Dark, fine, straight hair frames her face, with thin strands laying across the augmented side of her face.\n\nDominant features include intricate, black and dark grey metallic cybernetic implants on the right side of her face, precisely conforming to her cheekbone and temple. Transparent holographic elements with glowing electric blue and purple circuit lines and points of light emanate from beneath and around these implants, suggesting advanced internal mechanisms. Visible transparent tendrils or wires extend from the implants towards her eye and subtly across her cheek.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic and directional, casting a bright highlight on her left cheek and eye from an unseen warm light source to the left, creating strong contrast. The right side of her face, closer to the bionic elements, has internal illumination that interacts with the metallic and transparent parts. Hints of orange and purple light appear from below and behind the implants, contributing to the futuristic glow. The background is mostly dark and out of focus, allowing the subject to stand out. Subtly visible textures on her lips suggest a natural, slightly glossy finish in a muted pink hue. The overall mood is serious and enigmatic, with a touch of vulnerability conveyed by the human elements contrasting with the robotic ones. Sharp focus, cinematic depth of field.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle chest undulation from breathing. Loose hair sways gently. Cybernetic implant lights pulse and shift, casting faint reflections. Eye colors shimmer subtly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her augmented eye bursts with shifting, multi-colored light, illuminating her face. Her chest heaves violently, her breath catching. Strands of hair lash across her face as her head snaps in a sudden, sharp motion. The cybernetic implants on her cheek crackle with erratic energy, sending sparks dancing across her skin. The glowing elements within her neck surge with a blinding, pulsating intensity, casting stark shadows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The cybernetic implants on her face morph into intricate bioluminescent flora, blooming and receding with pulsing light. Her vibrant eyes become portals to swirling galaxies, where constellations drift and reform. Strands of hair subtly unspool into glowing threads of light that weave impossible patterns in the air, then retract back into her head, defying gravity. The skin around her face undulates like water, reflecting the otherworldly glow, while time itself ripples around her, causing distant light sources to shimmer and stretch into ribbons of color.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Opening with a slow zoom into the glowing, multifaceted eye, the camera then subtly tracks the rhythmic rise and fall of the chest. A dramatic light shift reveals glistening sweat and the gentle sway of hair strands. As the camera arcs, the embedded cybernetics pulse with increasing intensity, casting dramatic light onto the cheek. A final, close-up tilt reveals the shimmering inner workings of the prosthetic, hinting at underlying power.",
