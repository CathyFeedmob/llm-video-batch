    "video_prompt": "Animate the otter's whiskers with subtle twitches. Add a very slight, slow blink to the otter's eyes. Introduce a gentle, almost imperceptible sway to the otter's fur.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, realistic, and adorable illustration of an otter, with beautiful fur rendering, sitting next to a miniature wooden vanity table with a pink top. The otter is looking directly at the viewer with big, dark eyes, but is facing slightly to the side, holding a mascara wand in one paw. Its reflection is visible in a small circular wooden-framed mirror on the table, where it's applying pink eyeshadow and has long, exaggerated eyelashes. On the table are makeup items: an open compact with pink and light brown makeup, two makeup brushes, and a pink lip gloss bottle. The background is a soft, blurred domestic interior with warm natural lighting coming from the right, creating gentle shadows. The overall atmosphere is charming and whimsical. The colors are warm and natural, with pops of pink from the makeup. There's a subtle vignette around the edges. The scene is well-lit, highlighting the otter's fur and the details of the makeup. Composition is eye-level with the otter. A distinct logo \"c29\" in pink and white is placed in the bottom right corner of the image.\n\n**Art Style:** Hyperrealistic illustration with a touch of whimsy.\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused natural light from the right side, creating subtle highlights and shadows.\n**Colors:** Warm browns, creams, and natural wood tones, accented with vibrant pink from the makeup and table top.\n**Composition:** Medium shot, eye-level perspective with the otter, rule of thirds applied subtly to place the otter and mirror.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Otter's whiskers twitch subtly. Eyes perform a slow, slight blink. Fur sways imperceptibly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explode the otter's fur outwards with kinetic force, then retract it as if pulled by an unseen vortex. Make the mascara brush whip around wildly, painting streaks of vibrant color across the mirror. The small table shatters into splinters, then reforms in a violent burst of wood and pink. The otter's glance warps into a piercing, otherworldly glow that reflects dramatically in the shattered mirror.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The otter's whiskers stretch and coil, forming glowing, ethereal tendrils that reach towards iridescent reflections in the mirror. Its eyes, now liquid pools of starlight, slowly undulate, revealing shifting galaxies within. The fur on its body ripples like a cosmic ocean, changing color with the ebb and flow of an invisible tide, each strand blossoming into delicate, crystalline flowers that gently detach and float upwards, defying gravity before vanishing into whispers of light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A tight shot follows the mascara wand's journey in the otter's paw, before a slow, dramatic pull-back reveals the otter's full gaze, eyes blinking in slow motion. The camera smoothly orbits the otter as it blinks again, wind from an unseen fan rippling its fur, casting soft shadows as the mirror's light flares subtly, hinting at a hidden vanity and inner transformation.",
