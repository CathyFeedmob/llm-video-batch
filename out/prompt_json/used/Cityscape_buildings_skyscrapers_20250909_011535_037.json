    "video_prompt": "Subtle smoke wisps from some building tops, faint light shimmering on buildings, soft downward drift of distant fog.",
    "image_prompt": "An abstract cityscape painting, monochrome with touches of sepia and white, depicting tall buildings silhouetted against a light background. The style is fluid and painterly, resembling watercolor or ink wash. The composition shows the buildings concentrated in the center, appearing to melt downwards, creating a sense of height and a dreamlike quality. Handwritten text in a light grey or white tone overlays parts of the background on the left and right sides of the image, adding a textual and vintage element. The lighting suggests an ambient, diffused glow, with some windows of the buildings illuminated with bright white light, creating a stark contrast against the dark structures. The atmosphere is serene and contemplative. The overall color palette is dominated by various shades of grey, black, and white, with subtle warm undertones in some of the lighter building sections. A handwritten signature, \"29\", is visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few refined options, focusing exclusively on dynamic elements:\n\n**Option 1 (Concise & Focused):**\nSmoke gently unfurls from building peaks. Light subtly shimmers across architectural surfaces. Distant fog drifts slowly downwards.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly more descriptive of motion):**\nWisps of smoke emerge and dissipate above rooftops. Light plays and glints across building facades. A soft curtain of fog descends in the distance.\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasizing subtle change):**\nBuilding tops emit ephemeral tendrils of smoke. Light undulates and shifts on building surfaces. A distant, pale fog imperceptibly flows lower.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "CRASH! Buildings EXPLODE upward, a tidal wave of concrete and glass. Ink-black shadows WRITHE and CONVERGE, transforming into colossal, predatory forms that LUNGE across the skyline. Windows DETONATE with blinding flashes, spewing tendrils of LIGHT that SCORCH the air. The very ground BUCKLES and RIPS open. A maelstrom consumes the city, a symphony of destruction.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Buildings ripple like fluid, stretching infinitely upwards, then dissolving into a cascade of glowing script that writes itself backward from the sky. Smoke wisps morph into ethereal birds, flying downwards into the building's reflections which shimmer like alien galaxies. Distant fog solidifies into crystalline structures, then sublimes into pure light, pulled into the concrete.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A phantom crane shot glides over the monochromatic cityscape, subtle smoke wisps ascending from unseen building tops. Faint light shimmers, catching the soft downward drift of distant fog, hinting at a hidden world. The camera descends slowly, picking out individual buildings, their dark facades illuminated by sporadic, glowing windows. A theatrical, unsettling stillness pervades the scene, as if the city holds its breath, waiting. The shot concludes with a slow push-in, bringing the viewer closer to the mystery shrouded in the urban mist.",
