    "video_prompt": "Flickering lights around the butterflies, subtle sparkle and glitter effects across the background, and gentle swaying of the butterflies as if suspended by a breeze. Slight zoom and pan of the camera.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA whimsical, dreamy, ultra-detailed vertical wallpaper-style image featuring an ethereal swarm of delicate, translucent butterflies fluttering and hanging from invisible threads, creating a sense of magical motion.\n\n**Visual Elements & Style:**\n*   **Butterflies:** Each butterfly should be meticulously detailed, appearing almost like an ornament or a piece of jewelry made of iridescent, slightly translucent materials. Their wings should show fine vein-like patterns, reflecting subtle shifts of pastel colors like lavender, mint green, pale pink, and light blue. Their bodies should have a polished, metallic sheen in soft gold or iridescent pearl and display tiny, jewel-like antennae. They should have delicate, almost invisible thread-like appendages or legs hanging below them.\n*   **Background:** The background is a gradient blend of soft, dreamy pastels, transitioning from a warm, ethereal golden-yellow or peach at the upper right to a cooler, dusty lavender-blue at the lower left.\n*   **Sparkle/Glimmer:** The entire scene is infused with a dense, glittering effect, like fine sparkling fairy dust or bokeh lights. These tiny, shimmering particles should catch the light, creating a sense of magical luminescence across the image.\n*   **Light Streaks/Fibers:** Numerous shimmering, thin, luminous lines or fibers should gracefully traverse the scene, extending from out of frame and intersecting with the butterflies, as if they are suspended or drawn along these light paths. These lines should have glowing points of light along their length.\n*   **Bokeh:** Soft, out-of-focus circular light blurs (bokeh) of varying sizes are scattered throughout the background, adding depth and a dreamlike quality.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Dynamic Flow:** The butterflies and light streaks are arranged to create a dynamic, upward and outward flow, drawing the eye across the image.\n*   **Foreground Focus:** Several butterflies in the lower and mid-sections are in sharp focus, showcasing their intricate details, while others recede into soft focus in the background, implying depth.\n*   **Vertical Orientation:** The composition is designed for a vertical aspect ratio, suitable for a mobile wallpaper.\n\n**Colors & Lighting:**\n*   **Palette:** Predominantly soft pastels â€“ lavender, delicate blues, mint greens, pale pinks, and warm golden-peach tones.\n*   **Lighting:** Backlit, dramatic, and magical lighting. Strong, starburst-like glows emanate from some of the butterflies and key points along the light streaks, creating lens flare effects and casting soft, luminous highlights on the butterflies' forms. The overall lighting is soft but with intense, sparkling highlights.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Dreamy, magical, enchanting, ethereal, peaceful, and joyful.\n\n**Final Touches:**\n*   No text or numbers within the main composition (if the 'c29' is intended as an overlay, it should be disregarded in the image generation).\n*   High resolution, stunning clarity, volumetric lighting, photorealistic rendering with a touch of artistic stylization.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nButterflies gently sway with subtle wing movements. The background shimmers and flickers. Fine glitter particles drift across the frame. The camera subtly zooms in and pans, creating a sense of dynamic motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Supernatural fireflies ignite into a whirlwind of shattering glass butterflies, explosively bursting from the screen! Glittering shards erupt outwards, propelled by a violent ethereal wind. Rapid, disorienting camera jolts and sudden zooms plunge into the chaotic brilliance, as the shattered remnants fuse into a singular, rapidly pulsating supernova of light and energy!**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Butterflies defy gravity, hovering, then gently ascend to form constellations. Their wings shimmer, emitting glowing particles that coalesce into impossible, swirling nebulae. Light traces from their bodies, forming ethereal strings that vibrate, pulling galaxies from the void. Time fractures, and they ripple through reality, leaving trails of iridescent stardust that sing with silent frequencies.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms in on a glistening butterfly, its iridescent wings catching scattered light. A gentle breeze sweeps through, causing the delicate creatures to sway gracefully. The camera then pans out, revealing a myriad of these ethereal butterflies rising from a dazzling field of soft glitter, all illuminated by flickering light trails, gracefully ascending towards a glowing horizon.",
