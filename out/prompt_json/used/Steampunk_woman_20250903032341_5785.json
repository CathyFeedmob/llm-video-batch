  "video_prompt": "A young woman's composed, enigmatic expression subtly shifts as her lips part and a thin stream of smoke gracefully curls upwards from her pipe. On her back, intricate brass gears subtly turn, needles on circular gauges slowly twitch, and a fan-like element gently rotates. Her gloved left hand carefully adjusts a connected metallic object, triggering a faint, pulsating glow and a low, rhythmic hum from the complex apparatus. The sepia-toned, aged parchment background shows subtle, slow-moving grain and texture shifts.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt suitable for an image generation model:\n\n\"Highly detailed sepia-toned pen-and-ink illustration, vintage steampunk style, on aged parchment. A young woman, depicted waist-up, looks over her right shoulder at the viewer with a serious, steady gaze. She wears a headscarf, aviator goggles on her forehead, and her dark wavy hair frames her face. A briar smoking pipe, emitting a thin stream of smoke, is held in her mouth. She is dressed in a dark aviator jacket with a plush beige fur-lined collar, bulky sleeves, and a gear emblem on her arm. Her gloved left hand holds a small metallic cup connected by a tube to the incredibly intricate steampunk mechanical backpack strapped to her back, rich with brass and copper gears, dials, pipes, valves, and a prominent fan. She wears dark fitted trousers and a utility belt with a pouch. The background is a textured faded sepia parchment, framed by a dark irregular border and metallic decorative trim along the top and left edges. Rendered with strong lines, shading, and cross-hatching, a faint 'MAM' signature in the bottom left, evoking adventure and retro-futuristic charm.\"",
