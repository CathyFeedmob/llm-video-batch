Cable cars with tiny figures traverse wires above city. Fluffy dandelions sway. White smoke with golden specks rises, intertwining with glowing bulbs. ",
  "image_prompt": "A surreal and whimsical miniature world contained within a vibrant green teacup, resting on a dark wooden surface. Dark brown liquid drips down the teacup onto the matching saucer. Inside the teacup, a lush mossy landscape features intricate grey European cityscapes and a striking blue, spiraling galaxy-like water feature with tiny figures. Large dandelion puffs rise above the city, and a miniature cable car system with gondola-like cabins is strung across the teacup rim. Glowing light bulbs hang above, casting a warm light. Swirling white smoke with golden specks rises from the teacup. Full shot, slightly elevated angle, warm lighting, soft dark blurred background. Bottom right corner watermark \"c29\".",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Dark liquid actively drips from a green teacup onto its saucer. Inside the teacup, blue liquid dynamically swirls through a miniature city. Tiny figures move across mossy ground, while cable cars with miniature occupants traverse wires above. Fluffy dandelions gently sway. White smoke, speckled with gold, steadily rises, intertwining with glowing bulbs."
