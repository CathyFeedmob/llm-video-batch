    "video_prompt": "The dragon breathes softly, causing wisps of smoke to curl gently upwards and dissipate. Its scales subtly shimmer and shift as if breathing, while its eyes glow with a soft, pulsating light. The gold coins and gems beneath it twinkle individually from an imperceptible ambient light source. Around the cave, a few tiny specks of light gently drift down from the ceiling. A very slow, almost unnoticeable zoom in on the dragon concludes the scene.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA majestic, emerald-green dragon with golden horns and glowing red eyes, exhaling a soft plume of white smoke, is curled atop a massive hoard of shimmering gold coins and scattered, vibrant gemstones (ruby, emerald, amethyst, sapphire, topaz, diamond).

The scene is set within a dimly lit, ancient cave or crypt, with jagged, dark rock formations and stalactites hanging from the ceiling. In the background, hints of ancient, carved stone architecture with glowing blue glyphs or crystals are visible on the cave walls, suggesting an abandoned, mystical ruin. Atmospheric lighting filters from above, casting soft glows on certain areas, emphasizing the treasure and the dragon.
