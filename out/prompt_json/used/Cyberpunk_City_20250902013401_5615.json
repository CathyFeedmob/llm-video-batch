  "video_prompt": "A lone figure steadily walks away down a desolate, cracked path through a sprawling, dystopian cityscape. Towering, grimy buildings loom, their numerous orange-yellow windows flickering intermittently. Distant figures move across high pedestrian bridges spanning the narrow canyon. Smoke billows and steam vents from complex pipe networks on the structures. Small, glowing embers on the ground pulsate and subtly shift. A thick, grey haze slowly drifts through the distant, towering industrial canyons.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, capturing the essence of the description:\n\n\"**Dystopian, heavily industrialized megacity canyon**, dark, gritty, post-apocalyptic neo-noir. Towering, claustrophobic concrete and metal structures, covered in chaotic pipes, wires, and platforms, form a deep, narrow chasm. Low-angle, ground-level perspective looking up. Monochromatic dark greys and blacks dramatically lit by vibrant orange and yellow glows from countless grimy windows, vents, and scattered ground embers. Multiple utilitarian bridges span the canyon. A lone figure walks a desolate, debris-strewn path into thick haze under a perpetual, overcast twilight sky. Mood of urban decay, raw industry, and isolated survival.\"",
