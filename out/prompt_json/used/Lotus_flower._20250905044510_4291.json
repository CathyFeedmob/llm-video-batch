  "video_prompt": "A multi-colored lotus blooms, its petals shifting hues while red and blue energy streams unfurl. A golden sphere descends, scattering sparkling particles and bubbles. Light beams from a mountain peak, and a blue-white glow from the lotus stem creates radiating ripples and splashes across the water's surface, reflecting the dynamic scene.",
  "image_prompt": "A vibrant, fantastical image depicting a glowing, multi-colored lotus flower emerging from mystical water. Towering, snow-capped mountains form a dramatic backdrop under a bright sky. A powerful, bright white light beam emanates from the central mountain peak, illuminating a hovering golden, intricately patterned ring adorned with ancient symbols and surrounded by sparkling golden particles and transparent bubbles. The lotus petals display a beautiful color gradient (magenta to blue), with metallic gold edges. Swirling red material extends from the upper left, and blue from the right. A dark, spiraling metallic stem descends into the water, radiating brilliant blue and white light, creating ripples and concentric rings of shimmering gold and silver particles. The vibrant lotus reflection is visible in the dark, reflective water, which also subtly mirrors the sky and mountains. The majestic mountains are dusted with snow, set against a sky transitioning from a hazy glow to clear blue with scattered clouds and soft mist. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of natural elements and ethereal magic, suggesting spiritual awakening or an otherworldly landscape, emphasizing light, color, and reflections for depth and mystery.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Lotus petals bloom, their hues continuously shifting and morphing. Red and blue energy streams unfurl and dynamically spread. A golden sphere descends, actively scattering sparkling particles and bubbles during its movement. Light beams emanate and stretch from a mountain peak. A blue-white glow from the lotus stem generates radiating ripples and splashes, causing the water's surface to continually undulate and reflect the evolving scene's motions."
