    "video_prompt": "Rain falls, water ripples, lotus leaves subtly sway, lotus petals gently unfurl, birds blink and subtle breathing movements.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the given image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nThree fluffy, vibrant \"budgies\" (parakeets) of distinct colors: one pure white, one bright blue, and one soft pink, are perched closely together on a dark, wet, textured rock surface. The rock is partially submerged in still, clear water, creating subtle reflections of the birds and the surrounding environment.\n\nAbove the birds, large, broad lotus leaves with prominent veins provide a lush green backdrop and overhead shelter. Water droplets visibly bead on the leaves. To the upper right, a beautiful, opening pink lotus flower is prominently displayed, also with water droplets on its petals.\n\nThe scene is set in what appears to be a tranquil, natural outdoor environment experiencing a light, gentle rain. Thin, diagonal lines representing individual raindrops are clearly visible throughout the upper and middle sections of the image, subtly blurring the background.\n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, characteristic of an overcast or rainy day, highlighting the vibrant colors of the birds and the lotus. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, serene, and slightly whimsical. The colors are rich and saturated, with a good balance of greens, pinks, blues, and whites against the darker, wet rock. The composition is eye-level, focusing on the birds as the primary subjects, with the leaves and lotus flower elegantly framing the scene.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Three budgerigars (parakeets).\n*   **Colors (subjects):** Pure white, bright blue, soft pink.\n*   **Pose/Action (subjects):** Perched closely together, facing forward/slightly towards the viewer.\n*   **Perch:** Dark, wet, textured rock, partially submerged in water with reflections.\n*   **Background/Environment:** Large, green lotus leaves with visible veins, water droplets on leaves.\n*   **Supporting Elements:** Pink lotus flower with water droplets.\n*   **Weather/Atmosphere:** Light, gentle rain (depicted by diagonal lines), tranquil, serene, whimsical.\n*   **Lighting:** Soft, diffused, characteristic of overcast/rainy conditions.\n*   **Colors (overall):** Rich, saturated, balanced palette of greens, pinks, blues, whites, dark tones of rock/water reflections.\n*   **Composition:** Eye-level shot, birds in foreground/midground, leaves and lotus framing the scene.\n*   **Style:** Realistic but with a charming, slightly illustrative quality due to the vibrant colors and clear rain depiction.\n*   **Details:** Visible water droplets on leaves and lotus, subtle reflections in water, clear rain streaks.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rain streaks down, impacting a rippling surface. Lotus leaves gently undulate, their petals gradually expanding. Birds subtly perk and visibly breathe.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rain lashes down, becoming a raging torrent. Lotus leaves violently whip and tear. Lotus petals erupt with explosive force, shattering and reforming. Birds thrash and convulse, their feathers pulsing with raw energy. The water beneath them surges upwards in a geyser, defying gravity. A storm of feathers and petals explodes from the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Raindrops reverse course, spiraling upwards into vaporous lotus petals that unfurl and then snap shut like mouths. Birds melt into shimmering streaks of color, reforming as watery reflections that swim through solid air. Leaves unfurl downwards into the ground, revealing roots that glow with inner light, while lotuses blossom in reverse, drawing color from the ambient darkness. Time itself warps, causing everything to exist in simultaneous past and future states, caught in an eternal, impossible present.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Rain intensifies, large drops striking the immense lotus leaves, causing them to flinch and ripple. A dramatic pull-back reveals three vibrant budgies, huddling closer as the downpour strengthens. A powerful, sweeping zoom-in focuses on their wide, blinking eyes, their tiny chests visibly heaving with each breath, embodying vulnerability amidst the storm. The camera then cranes upwards, showcasing the solitary lotus bloom, its delicate petals bowing under the weight of the water.",
