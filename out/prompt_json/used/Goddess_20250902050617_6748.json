  "video_prompt": "A celestial woman's gaze subtly shifts as she actively conjures a pulsating blue energy orb from her left hand and a fiery golden flame from her right. Her flowing gown and ethereal cape gently ripple, while golden jewelry subtly shimmers. In the cosmic background, an ornate golden ring pulses with light. Swirling nebulae, twinkling stars, and molten gold planets slowly drift. Geometric golden diamonds and a futuristic spaceship also float, their surfaces catching shifting light.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, combining key elements and aesthetic descriptors:\n\n\"A majestic divine woman, goddess-like, at the center of an opulent cosmic universe. She has fair skin, flowing white-blonde hair, and an elaborate golden circlet. She wears an opulent golden flowing gown (classical Greek/Roman style), an ethereal light blue cape, and intricate golden jewelry including a prominent blue gemstone choker and matching earrings. Her raised hands radiate power: one conjuring a shimmering blue energy orb, the other a fiery golden flame.\n\nShe is framed by a massive, ornate glowing golden celestial ring/astrolabe. The deep cosmic background swirls with golden nebulae, twinkling golden stars, molten golden planets with blue accents, and floating geometric golden diamonds (one above her blue orb). In the lower right, a sleek futuristic golden spaceship with a glowing golden chalice. An elaborate jewel-encrusted scepter with a sparkling diamond orb head rests nearby.\n\nHigh fantasy, science fiction, cosmic art aesthetic. Opulent, ethereal, mystical, divine, dynamic lighting. Dominated by rich gold, deep blues, and shimmering whites. Ultra-detailed, cinematic, godray effects.\"",
