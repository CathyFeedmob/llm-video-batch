    "video_prompt": "A subtle breeze causes the scarf around her head and neck to gently ripple and flutter, with a few strands of hair escaping and swaying. Her eyes softly blink, and the light reflecting in them subtly shifts. Dust motes slowly drift across the desert background. The camera very slowly and subtly zooms in.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down by visual elements, designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A young, beautiful woman, likely of Middle Eastern or North African descent, looking directly at the viewer with an intense and penetrating gaze. Her face is partially covered by a flowing headscarf.\n\n**Composition:** Medium close-up, focused on the woman's face and upper torso. Her body is angled slightly to the right, with her head turned to face the camera. The background suggests an expansive desert landscape.\n\n**Hair & Features:** Dark brown hair, some wisps escaping from under the headscarf. Expressive, large eyes with striking heterochromia (one eye amber/golden, the other emerald green with golden flecks). Long, delicate eyelashes. Soft, well-defined eyebrows. Her nose is aquiline, and her lips are full, partially obscured by the fabric of the scarf. A hint of a serene or contemplative expression.\n\n**Attire/Props:** She is wearing a light, flowing, sand-colored headscarf draped around her head and partially covering the lower half of her face, with folds and textures visible. The scarf has subtle woven or striped patterns. A dark garment (possibly a dress or abaya) is visible beneath the scarf, with hints of embroidered or patterned fabric on the shoulders/chest.\n\n**Setting/Background:** A warm, sun-drenched desert landscape with rolling sand dunes. The horizon is visible in the distance, suggesting vast emptiness.\n\n**Lighting:** Golden hour lighting from the upper left, casting a strong, soft glow on the woman's face, particularly her forehead, nose, and the scarf folds. There are strong highlights and subtle shadows that emphasize facial contours and fabric textures. The light also illuminates the edges of the scarf and hair, creating a halo effect.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by warm earth tones: various shades of golden yellow, burnt orange, amber, and rich browns, contrasting with the soft, off-white/cream of the scarf. Accents of emerald green and gold in her eyes. The sky is a pale, diffused yellow/white from the bright light source.\n\n**Art Style:** Digital painting with a painterly, illustrative, and slightly impressionistic quality. The brushstrokes are visible, adding to a textural feel. It leans towards realism but with an ethereal and artistic touch. High level of detail in the eyes and subtle fabric textures.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Mysterious, serene, contemplative, and slightly exotic. Evokes a sense of quiet strength and dignity.\n\n**Optional Details for AI:**\n*   **Artistic Influence:** Inspired by artists known for rendering beautiful female portraits with dramatic lighting and textile details.\n*   **Resolution/Quality:** High resolution, very detailed, sharp focus on the face.\n*   **Emotion:** Thoughtful, calm, observant.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Her scarf gently ripples and flutters; stray hair sways. Her eyes softly blink, reflecting a subtle light shift. Dust motes drift. The camera subtly zooms.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her eyes snap open, pupils dilating wildly as a vortex of sand erupts behind her, whipping her scarf and hair violently. Dust roils into a tempest. Her head jerks to frame the sudden, jarring zoom, as golden light bursts from her eyes, illuminating the chaotic desert.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her gaze pulls sand motes from the desert into her heterochromatic eyes, which slowly morph into swirling galaxies. The scarf unravels upwards, reforming into shimmering desert dunes. Her hair strands become ephemeral shimmering lights, pulling the sun inward as the desert folds into an impossible geometric landscape, all flowing backward in time.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic wind whips the scarf outwards, revealing her full face. Her eyes, filled with a steely resolve, lock onto an unseen distant horizon. A subtle camera zoom intensifies the gaze, as a single tear escapes. The desert background blurs into a sweeping panorama, emphasizing her solitary strength.",
