  "video_prompt": "Underwater flow: sunlight shimmers, organic debris drifts on surface, fish dart through blooming coral roses swaying in the current.  Roses glow as light shafts shift. Minimal seabed movement.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:**\n\nUnderwater view of a vibrant field of coral-pink roses blooming on the seabed, looking up towards the shimmering surface. Sunlight shafts pierce the blue water, illuminating floating reddish-orange debris and small fish. Lush, detailed roses with glowing petals create a surreal, enchanting garden.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Underwater currents actively flow. Sunlight dynamically shimmers while light shafts continually shift through the water. Organic debris drifts slowly across the surface. Fish swiftly dart between coral roses, which gently sway in the current. The roses' luminosity shifts, glowing and dimming as light shafts move across them. The seabed's movement remains minimal, with only soft undulations."
