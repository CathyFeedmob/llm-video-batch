  "video_prompt": "White felt crane stretches its black neck, its red crown dipping as it steps gracefully into rippling, blue-grey water. Pink felt cherry blossoms gently sway on branches above, their petals softly falling onto the water's surface, carried by subtle currents past fluffy felt grass and grey felt rocks.",
  "image_prompt": "Felted art scene, serene spring landscape. A majestic white felt crane with black neck/tail and red crown, stands on black legs by reflective blue-grey felt water. Pink felt cherry blossoms with yellow centers float on water and branch above. Light, fluffy felt mimics dry grass/moss and grey felt rocks line banks. Soft grey and blue misty background. Vertical image, tranquil and delicate.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A white felt crane extends its black neck, its red crown lowering, as it gracefully wades into the water. The blue-grey water ripples around its entry. Pink felt cherry blossoms sway on branches overhead, their petals detaching and drifting onto the surface. Subtle currents then carry the fallen petals across the water."
