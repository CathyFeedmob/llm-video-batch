    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot, a colossal, weathered Optimus Prime robot from Transformers, in a ruined, dark, post-apocalyptic junkyard or workshop setting, towering over a small, young red-haired human boy with a backpack. The robot's face is central and imposing, detailed with rust, grime, and scratches, showing heavy battle damage. Its blue and red armor is faded and worn. The iconic red Autobot symbol glows subtly on its forehead.\n\nThe boy stands on a raised piece of debris in the foreground, facing away from the viewer, looking up in awe and slight trepidation at the immense robot. He is dwarfed by the sheer scale of Optimus Prime.\n\n**Visual elements:**\n*   Optimus Prime: Extremely large, heroic but damaged, worn blue and red plating, a prominent and weathered face, glowing red Autobot symbol on forehead, visible mechanical details, tubes, and gears.\n*   Boy: Small, slender, red hair, dark blue shirt, grey pants, black backpack, facing away, conveying a sense of scale and wonder.\n*   Environment: Industrial ruins, piles of scrap metal and mangled machinery, debris scattered everywhere. Suggestion of larger structures or parts of the robot’s body in the midground and background, all contributing to a sense of decay and aftermath.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Realistic, cinematic, yet with a hint of painterly detail.\n*   Sci-fi, post-apocalyptic, with a focus on gritty textures and intricate mechanical design.\n*   Inspired by live-action Transformer movies (e.g., Bumblebee, Rise of the Beasts) but with a more grounded, serious tone.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Vertical orientation.\n*   Optimale Prime's head and upper torso dominate the upper two-thirds of the frame.\n*   The boy is in the lower-middle, positioned strategically to emphasize the size difference.\n*   Diagonal lines from the debris and robot parts lead the eye towards Optimus Prime.\n*   Strong depth of field, with the foreground debris and background machinery slightly out of focus.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Predominantly dark, desaturated tones: muted blues, reds, grays, and browns, reflecting the decayed environment.\n*   Contrasting subtle light source from Optimus Prime's eyes (if visible) and the glowing Autobot symbol, providing a focal point.\n*   Warm reddish hues in the ambient light, particularly around the head, suggesting a dusty, perhaps smoky atmosphere or a sunset.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Dramatic, low-key lighting.\n*   Main light source appears to be coming from the front/top, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the texture of the robot.\n*   Volumetric lighting, with dust motes or atmosphere visible in shafts of light.\n*   Subtle glow from the Autobot symbol and possibly the robot's eyes.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Awe-inspiring, poignant, desolate, and slightly mysterious.\n*   A sense of quiet reflection amidst ruin.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Jolt through debris! Massive jolt rocks Optimus Prime, his eyes flash fiercely. Smoke billows explosively, debris shrapnel blasts upward. Camera lunges forward, crashing into the action as his head violently turns, scanning the chaos. Fire rages, swirling around the kid as the ground buckles.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Optimus Prime’s metallic face softens, eyes slowly dissolving into glowing nebulae. Debris floats upwards, forming constellations as the child gently ascends, morphing into a shimmering celestial being. The world around them unspins into pure light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A subtle light flickers on Optimus Prime's weathered face, his eyes slowly illuminate with a faint blue glow. Gentle smoke wisps rise from the surrounding debris, catching the light. The camera slowly pushes in towards them, a slight shimmer in the air. The giant robot’s head turns slightly, almost imperceptibly, his eyes locking onto the small boy.",
