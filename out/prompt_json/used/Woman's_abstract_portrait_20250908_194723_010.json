    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided artwork:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA vibrant, abstract expressionist painting of a woman's face, central and emerging from concentric, swirling circles of color. The style is highly dynamic, with visible brushstrokes and energetic paint splatters and drips.\n\n**Visual Elements & Composition:**\n*   **Subject:** A woman's symmetrical face, rendered with delicate features (defined eyes, nose, and full red lips) in direct contrast to the loose, abstract background. Her skin tone is cool-toned, possibly light blue or teal, with highlights on her nose and cheekbones.\n*   **Concentric Circles:** Large, bold concentric circles emanate outwards from around her head, primarily in shades of red, white, and green, suggesting a sense of motion or a target-like effect.\n*   **Abstract Background:** The background is a chaotic yet harmonious mix of large, expressive paint swaths and splatters in various shades of teal, deep blue, green, red, yellow, and black.\n*   **Paint Splatters & Drips:** Throughout the entire canvas, there are numerous small and large paint splatters, dots, and prominent drips, especially of red, yellow, and blue, adding to the energetic and unfinished feel. Some splatters take on a circular, orb-like appearance.\n*   **Lines & Streaks:** Thin, arc-shaped lines of red, white, and yellow crisscross the composition, some looking like intentional strokes, others like trails from flung paint.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Teal, deep blue, various greens (forest green, lime green), vibrant red, and black.\n*   **Accent:** Bright yellow, white, and occasional light pink/peach.\n*   **Palette:** High contrast, saturated colors.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Lighting:** Diffuse and even, allowing the colors to pop without harsh shadows. The luminosity of the colors themselves creates a radiant effect.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Energetic, chaotic, emotional, modern, and artistic. A sense of vibrant expression and strong feeling.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Abstract Expressionism, characterized by bold, spontaneous application of paint.\n*   Mix of figurative (the face) and abstract elements.\n*   Strong influence of action painting techniques (splattering, dripping).\n*   Bold graphic quality due to the circles and contrast.\n\n**Artistic Medium:**\n*   Acrylic or oil paint on canvas, with visible texture from brushstrokes and thick impasto in some areas.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refined Prompt:\n\nRed and yellow paint drips. White rings around the woman's face pulse. Her eyes blink, lips twitch into a smile. Glittering particles drift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Red and yellow paint dramatically explodes, splattering aggressively upwards. White, jagged rings violently shatter and reform around the woman's face, pulsing erratically. Her eyes snap open, glaring, as her lips contort into a sneer. Swirling vortexes of glittering particles erupt around her, ripping through the air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Crimson rivers flow upwards, pooling into fiery orbs that orbit the woman's face like chaotic moons. Her eyes, now pools of shimmering starlight, reflect galaxies that implode and reform within their depths. The white rings unravel into spiraling ribbons of light, weaving impossible knots before dissolving into pure energy. Specks of glitter, no longer bound by gravity, dance in reverse, coalescing into fleeting cosmic dust bunnies that shimmer and vanish. Her smile expands to encompass the entire canvas, revealing a void of swirling colors.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in on the woman's face, her eyes (her eyes slowly blink, and her lips twitch into a faint, knowing smile). As she smiles, the (white circular rings around the woman's face gently pulse outwards), reverberating with the (red and yellow paint splatters subtly drip downwards) and shimmering (glittering particles drift through the air). The camera then sweeps back, revealing the full vibrant chaos.",
