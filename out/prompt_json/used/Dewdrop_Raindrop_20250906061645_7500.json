  "image_prompt": "A vertical full shot of a glistening dewdrop suspended between two bright green blades of grass, creating a natural fisheye lens effect. The dewdrop reflects an inverted, compressed image of a bare tree, with a brightly shining, starburst sun and light blue sky above it. The grass blades are covered in shimmering dew individual droplets, with subtle reddish-brown tips. The background is a soft bokeh of vibrant greens, warm golden, and orange hues, suggesting sunrise or sunset. Natural backlighting from the left creates highlights and a dreamy atmosphere.",
