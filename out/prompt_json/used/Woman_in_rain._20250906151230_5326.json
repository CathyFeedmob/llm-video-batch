  "video_prompt": "A young woman, head bowed, shifts her weight on a rain-slicked street. Wet hair clings to her as her soaked clothing subtly clings. Rain actively falls and streaks, reflecting car lights that pass by, creating moving light trails on the wet ground. Discarded red roses and petals shift slightly in the downpour. \n",
  "image_prompt": "Melancholic vertical full shot: Young woman, back to viewer, standing barefoot on rain-slicked urban street at dusk/night. She has long, dark, wet hair, wearing a soaked white shirt. Discarded red roses and petals litter the wet ground. Reflective street shows car headlights/taillights and streaking rain. Subtle halo effect around her head/shoulders.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A young woman subtly shifts her weight, her downcast head conveying a somber expression. Wet hair and soaked clothing subtly cling and ripple with her minimal movement. Rain actively streaks downwards, continuously agitating the street's surface. Car lights sweep by, their reflections elongating into dynamic, moving trails on the wet ground. Discarded roses and petals gently scatter and drift under the downpour."
