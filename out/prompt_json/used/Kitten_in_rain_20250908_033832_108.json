    "video_prompt": "Animated rainfall streaks down vertically, with subtle ripples forming in the puddles on the ground. The glowing outlines of the cat, butterfly, and flowers gently pulse and shimmer, casting soft light reflections on the wet surface. Distant bokeh lights gently shift and glow. A subtle camera zoom or pan slowly draws in or sweeps across the scene.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical and enchanting night scene, showcasing a stylized, glowing outline of a black cat mid-pounce, illuminated like neon. The cat is looking content, with a smaller glowing outline of a butterfly perched on its tail. The background is a rain-soaked street or road at night, with discernible individual raindrops falling, creating a dynamic sense of motion. The street surface is reflective, showing blurred reflections of light sources. In the foreground, glowing outlines of stylized flowers and grass appear to grow from the wet ground, twinkling with light. Overhead, out-of-focus bokeh lights in warm orange, yellow, and subtle blue hues simulate distant streetlights or city lights, shimmering through the rain. The overall lighting is dim yet magical, with the primary light sources emanating from the glowing outlines and the distant bokeh lights. The colors are predominantly dark cool tones for the sky and road, contrasting with the bright, warm yellow/orange glow of the outlines and bokeh. The atmosphere is peaceful, dreamy, and slightly melancholic due to the rain, yet imbued with a sense of wonder and charm. The composition features the cat as the central focus, with the glowing elements drawing the eye. \"C29\" is subtly placed in the bottom right corner. Shot with a soft focus, giving a slightly painterly feel.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rain streaks intensify, forming expanding ripples in puddles. The cat's glow pulses with a subtle head turn. The butterfly's wings gently unfurl, its glow shimmering. Flowers subtly sway, their light reflecting. Bokeh lights drift and brighten. A slow, continuous camera pan reveals new elements.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Rain streaks violently, whipping into a swirling vortex that lifts the glowing cat, butterfly, and flowers into the air, their light bursts aggressively, casting dazzling, erratic reflections. Distant bokeh lights rapidly expand and contract like eyes. The ground fissures, erupting with glowing tendrils that ensnare the cat as it lunges at the frantically flapping butterfly, leaving behind an explosive trail of light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Glowing outlines of cat, butterfly, and flowers shimmer, detaching from the ground to float upwards, drawing the bokeh lights with them into a swirling vortex. Rain streaks defy gravity, coalescing into reflective droplets that form miniature, inverted cityscapes. Petals from the neon flowers detach and morph into flocks of luminescent butterflies, ascending through the watery reflections. The ground itself gently undulates, mirroring the impossible dance above.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic close-up reveals individual rain streaks before the camera dramatically pulls back, unveiling the glowing cat leaping towards a shimmering butterfly. The camera sweeps low, following the cat's descent as the luminescent flowers burst forth with intensity, reflecting brilliantly on the wet ground. Distant bokeh lights pulsate, mirroring the Cat's joy. The final shot is a triumphant, wide pan as the kitty celebrates its new flower friends.",
