    "video_prompt": "Subtle movement of hair and ribbons in the wind. Gentle rippling in the puddle, with slight reflections shimmering. Slight sway in the wildflowers. Slow, subtle breathing animation for the character. Slight upwards camera drift.",
    "image_prompt": "An anime-style render of Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion, wearing her iconic red plugsuit, kneeling beside a small puddle with a reflection, her head bowed and one hand covering her mouth as if crying. Tears streak down her face. The setting is a serene outdoor landscape with vibrant purple, yellow, and white wildflowers in the foreground and stretching towards the background. A body of water or lake is visible behind her, and mountains are in the distant background under a clear blue sky with sparse white clouds. The overall lighting is bright and natural, suggesting daytime. The style is detailed and realistic, with a focus on her suit's texture and the reflections in the water. The composition is a vertical shot, with Asuka occupying the central focus, and the flowers and puddle in the lower foreground. The atmosphere is melancholic and peaceful.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Hair and ribbons flutter. Puddle surface undulates, reflecting glints. Wildflowers sway imperceptibly. Character's chest rises and falls gently. Camera drifts upward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Ferocious winds whip Asuka's hair and ribbons into violent disarray, thrashing around her face. The puddle beneath her churns wildly, reflections distorting into erratic, swirling chaos. Wildflowers explode upwards from the ground, then dramatically snap back, their petals tearing. Asuka's body convulses with rapid, distressed gasps, her suit groaning with strained movements. The camera dramatically plunges downward, then aggressively jolts back up, capturing the tumultuous scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The puddle surface impossibly shatters into crystalline fragments, which then slowly ascend and reform into a liquid crown on the character's head, each droplet reflecting shifting, impossible color gradients. Wildflowers spontaneously animate, their petals forming melodic whispers as they float upwards, dissolving into stardust. Asuka's tears morph into miniature galaxies, spiraling upwards into her eyes, which in turn faintly glow with ancient starlight. Her suit subtly pulses, each beat causing ripples of pure light through the air, completely defying gravity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Camera slowly descends to eye-level with the weeping pilot in the foreground. Quick zoom-in on a tear tracing her cheek, then a subtle camera push reveals her reflection in the puddle, shimmering in distress. The wind subtly picks up, causing the wildflowers and her hair to gently sway. Her hand slowly rises, brushing away the tear, revealing the anguish in her eyes. Fade to black.",
