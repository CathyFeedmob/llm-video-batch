    "video_prompt": "Flickering candlelight casts dancing shadows across the vast library. A figure at the top of the stairs breathes subtly, their robe gently shifts. Dust motes drift in the air, catching the light from the mystical orb above. The orb pulsates softly, sending faint ripples of light onto the surrounding bookshelves. The moon in the distance glows slightly, and subtle shimmer can be observed around it. A gentle, imperceptible sway to the entire scene hints at hidden magical energies.",
    "image_prompt": "A detailed, hyperrealistic, and cinematic full shot of a grand fantastical library at night. The main subject is a robed figure standing at the base of a sweeping spiral staircase that curves upwards and outward to both sides of the frame. The library is multi-tiered with tall, dark wooden bookshelves filled with countless ancient books, illuminated primarily by the soft, warm glow of hundreds of flickering candles placed along every railing, shelf, and floor level. The architecture is ornate and gothic, with intricate carvings on the pillars and railings.\n\nAbove the library, the ceiling is open, revealing a celestial nighttime sky filled with sparkling stars and subtle nebulae. A bright, glowing full moon in a cool blue hue is visible on the right. Dominating the upper center is a large, ethereal golden orb or sphere, emitting a powerful, bright beam of light that streams downwards, creating a magical and mysterious focal point directly above the robed figure. Scattered antique books lie on the stairs and various surfaces, suggesting a place of deep knowledge and arcane study.\n\nThe color palette is rich, dominated by warm oranges and golds from the candlelight and starscape, contrasting with deep blues, teals, and dark browns of the library's structure and the nighttime sky. The lighting creates strong highlights and deep shadows, enhancing the dramatic and atmospheric mood. The composition is symmetrical and grand, drawing the eye towards the central figure and the celestial elements above.\n\nStyle: Fantasy art, magical realism, cinematic.\nLighting: Warm candlelight, ethereal celestial glow, dramatic chiaroscuro.\nAtmosphere: Mysterious, scholarly, magical, awe-inspiring, ancient.\nDetails: Ornate gothic architecture, detailed book bindings, shimmering starlight, faint smoke trails from candles, polished dark wood.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Flickering candlelight creates shifting shadows. A figure subtly breathes, their robe gently swaying. Dust motes drift and catch light from a softly pulsating, rippling orb. The distant moon shimmers. The entire scene subtly sways.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Candles explode with frantic, leaping flames. The figure on the stairs lurches, robes violently whipping. Bookshelves violently shudder and tilt, books flying off shelves. The mystical orb above blasts intense, erratic light, sending aggressive shockwaves through the library. The moon pulsates with blinding energy, its shimmer expanding into furious ripples. The entire scene furiously convulses, hinting at an unleashed magical cataclysm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The central figure's robe unravels into constellations, each star drifting upwards to join the pulsating orb which, instead of light, emits silent, expanding echoes that rearrange the bookshelves into impossible, rotating geometries. Books levitate, pages flapping like wings through inverse rain. The moon multiplies, its reflections ripple-warping the library into a kaleidoscope where time is a spiral staircase, climbing downwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, sweeping camera pans across flickering candles illuminating towering bookshelves. The camera glides up the grand staircase. Close-up on cloaked figure, chest subtly rising and falling; their robe barely ripples. The camera rapidly zooms into the pulsating mystical orb, its intense glow briefly casting shadows. Then, a quick pan to the subtly shimmering moon outside. Finally, a shot that reveals all, highlighting the magical energy subtly swaying the entire scene.",
