    "video_prompt": "A subtle camera push-in reveals the faint shimmer of heat haze rising from the distant industrial structures. Wisps of dark smoke curl and drift from the chimneys, subtly changing shape and density against the sky. The red lights on the various structures and along the bridge flicker with a soft, warm glow. Very slight swaying of fabric on the two figures on the bridge.",
    "image_prompt": "A dystopian landscape at sunset, featuring a massive, heavily fortified suspension bridge reminiscent of the Brooklyn Bridge with gothic elements. Smoke billows from industrial structures and turrets on either side of the bridge. Two silhouetted figures stand centrally on the bridge's lower platform, facing the receding light. The scene is dominated by a warm, orange and muted grey color palette. Red glowing lights are strategically placed throughout the foreground and midground, suggesting surveillance or warning signals. The composition uses deep perspective, looking down a canyon-like urban environment formed by layered structures, with more red lights visible in the depths. The overall aesthetic is dark and gritty, hinting at steampunk or cyberpunk influences with a sense of oppressive grandeur. The lighting emphasizes the silhouettes and the glowing red elements against the bright sky and hazy background.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Subtle camera push-in. Heat haze shimmers. Dark smoke curls and shifts. Red lights softly flicker. Fabric subtly sways on figures.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "*Camera jolts violently forward, plunging through the bridge. The entire industrial landscape begins to warp and shudder, structures groaning and cracking under an invisible force. Red lights flare, blindingly bright, then explode into fragmented sparks. Pillars of smoke erupt into furious fiery tornadoes, tearing through the sky. Figures on the bridge rip apart, dissolving into gusts of ash.*",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A subtle camera push-in reveals the shimmer of heat haze from distant structures, twisting into ethereal serpents that dance upwards. Wisps of dark smoke curl and drift, then reverse, reforming into solid, black architectural elements that vanish into the chimneys they came from. The red lights on structures pulse and stretch, becoming liquid ribbons of light that flow impossibly across the bridge and morph into fleeting fireflies before sinking into the ground. The two figures on the bridge dissolve into translucent mist, their outlines briefly mirroring the bridge's arches, before reforming in reversed positions through shimmering air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, initially distant, slowly pushes in, revealing a desolate industrial landscape. Intense heat shimmers from the distant structures, as dark smoke billows from towering chimneys, morphing and swirling with menacing intent. The red warning lights, countless and ominous, pulse rhythmically, casting a sinister glow on the scene. The camera rises and sweeps over the gorge, revealing the two figures standing small and still on the bridge. Their cloaks ripple in an unseen updraft, as a single, piercing red beam suddenly flashes from the depths below, briefly illuminating their faces in stark terror.",
