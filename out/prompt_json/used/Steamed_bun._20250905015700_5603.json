  "image_prompt": "A whimsical, high-angle shot on a stark white background features a giant, plump, freshly steamed baozi bun serving as a house. The bun has visible folds on top, with silver-framed doors glowing yellow from within, and smaller unlit windows. A winding path of pale-yellow powder leads from the bottom right to an open door, along which a tiny figure in a blue shirt and orange backpack walks towards the bun-house from behind. Bright, even lighting creates soft shadows. Whimsical, surreal, childlike wonder.",
