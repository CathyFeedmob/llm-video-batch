  "video_prompt": "A large translucent sphere gently hovers, its brilliant core pulsating with light, causing its iridescent surface to shimmer with shifting rainbow colors and emanating soft lens flares. Beneath it, a golden, reflective surface continuously swirls with luminous patterns, creating dynamic shimmering streaks. Two smaller spheres also pulse and shimmer with light. Countless tiny golden lights twinkle and shift at the bottom, while broad, fluid rainbow bands slowly undulate across the reflective ground. The abstract background subtly darkens and lightens, emphasizing the glowing elements.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed but Concise):**\n\"Visually rich, highly stylized digital art of an ethereal cosmic landscape. Central: A large translucent iridescent sphere with a brilliant glowing white/light blue nebula core, multifaceted crystalline surface, and prominent lens flares. Below, a vast highly polished metallic liquid surface with luminous golden concentric swirling patterns, like a celestial vortex, exhibiting shimmering reflections and chromatic aberrations. Two smaller similar iridescent spheres, lower left and right, with glowing cores and subtle lens flares. Bottom: A dazzling field of tiny sparkling golden/yellow lights (stardust/bokeh effect) with broad horizontal rainbow-like reflective streaks. Dominated by light, reflections, and intricate patterns. Palette: warm golds, brilliant whites, cool blues, vivid iridescence. High-contrast dramatic lighting against a dark, indistinct background. Evokes wonder and cosmic mystery.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\"Highly stylized, visually rich cosmic landscape digital art. Main: large translucent iridescent sphere with a brilliant white/blue nebula core, multifaceted surface, prominent lens flares. Below: vast polished metallic liquid surface with luminous golden concentric swirling patterns, celestial vortex effect, shimmering reflections. Two smaller iridescent spheres with glowing cores (lower left/right). Bottom: dazzling field of golden/yellow stardust/bokeh lights and broad rainbow-like reflective streaks. Palette: warm golds, brilliant whites, cool blues, vivid iridescence. High-contrast dramatic lighting, dark background. Ethereal, wondrous, cosmic mystery.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise):**\n\"Ethereal cosmic landscape, highly stylized digital art. Central: Large iridescent sphere with glowing nebula core, lens flares. Below: Polished metallic liquid surface, luminous golden swirling vortex patterns, reflections. Smaller iridescent spheres (left/right). Bottom: Dazzling field of golden stardust/bokeh, rainbow reflections. Dominant light, reflections, intricate patterns. Warm golds, brilliant whites, cool blues, vivid iridescence. High-contrast, dark background. Wonder, cosmic mystery.\"\n\n**Recommendation:** Option 2 strikes a good balance between detail and conciseness, providing enough information for the AI to capture the complexity without being overly verbose.",
