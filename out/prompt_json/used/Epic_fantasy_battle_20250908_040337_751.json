    "video_prompt": "A subtle zoom out, then a slow pan across the scene. The storm clouds above gather, with lightning flickering more intensely and streaking across the sky. The fiery wolf's fur flares and flickers with embers, and its wings subtly beat. The ice giant's body glows intermittently with cold blue energy, and the ice shards around him shimmer. The hero's hair and clothing subtly sway, and the energy emanating from his axe pulses. The lava river flows with small, undulating waves and casts flickering light onto the surrounding rocks. The eyes of the various warriors and creatures in the background subtly shift. The small creatures near the lava river twitch and move slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVertical fantasy illustration, epic mythological battle scene. Top half centers on a massive, fire-winged dark wolf or dragon-like creature with glowing orange eyes and fur, roaring into a stormy, fiery red sky with aggressive lightning bolts. Opposite, a towering, muscular yeti-like ice giant with white fur and glowing blue eyes, wielding a large, glowing blue hammer, stands amidst jagged ice formations, surrounded by intense blue lightning.\n\nThe middle ground features a heroic Viking-like warrior with long blonde hair and dark blue armor, heavily armored and wielding a glowing blue battle axe, poised for combat. Below him, a chaotic army of dark, horned, humanoid creatures and small, fire-maned wolves advance across a desolate, cracked landscape. A prominent river of molten, glowing orange lava snakes through the center of the battlefield, with scattered, sharp rock formations.\n\nThe background shows a sprawling, dark, and ruined city with gothic-inspired architecture under the dramatic, lightning-streaked sky. The overall color palette is dominated by intense contrasting reds, oranges, and fiery tones on one side, and vibrant blues, whites, and icy tones on the other, creating a dynamic clash. Dramatic lighting from the lightning and lava casts strong shadows and highlights, emphasizing the tension and scale of the battle. High detail, sharp focus, epic scale, dynamic composition.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle zoom out and slow pan. Storm clouds gather, lightning streaks. Fiery wolf's fur flares, wings beat. Ice giant glows, ice shards shimmer. Hero's hair sways, axe pulses. Lava river undulates, casting flickering light. Background eyes subtly shift. Small creatures twitch.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive zoom-out, violent pan across an erupting battlefield! Lightning streaks tear the sky, striking randomly. The fiery wolf roars, leaping forward, wings violently thrashing, fur igniting! The ice giant bellows, slamming its hammer, sending ice shards exploding outwards. The hero charges, axe glowing brighter, shimmering energy surging! Lava river erupts, geysers of molten rock spray skyward. Background creatures furiously duel, shadowy figures lunge and vanish. Sudden, chaotic movements everywhere!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The fiery wolf melts into liquid gold, flowing into the lava river, which then spirals upwards into the storm clouds, forming an impossible inverse waterfall of fire. The ice giant's ice shards liquefy then re-solidify into translucent musical notes, which float and resonate in the air. The hero's axe dissolves into a swarm of luminous butterflies that reverse time, causing the falling rain to rise, and the distant ruined city to re-erect itself. The background warriors become shadow puppets, their movements mirroring the rising rain, their weapons turning into beams of pure, bending light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms out, revealing a vast war-torn landscape under a raging storm. Lightning intensely streaks across the sky as a fiery wolf, wings beating, lunges from the left. Simultaneously, an ice giant on the right pulsates with cold blue energy, his hammer glowing. The camera then swiftly pans down to a heroic warrior, his axe pulsing with power, as he charges across a flowing lava river. The scene culminates in a sweeping upward shot that captures the chaotic battle unfolding.",
