    "video_prompt": "Rose petals subtly falling, especially closer to the foreground. The brilliant light at the end of the aisle subtly pulsates or flickers. The woman's dress slightly sways as if she's slowly walking.",
    "image_prompt": "A digital painting from a low-angle, back view of a woman climbing a grand staircase in a theater, looking up at a mystical, glowing light source from above. The staircase is covered in a plush red carpet, scattered with red rose petals, and features contrasting cool-toned stone railings. The theater is expansive, with rows of red velvet seats tapering into the distance, framed by dark, elegant architecture and ornate lamps on the walls. Petals are falling from the ceiling, which is dark yet illuminated by sparkling dust and the central beam of light. The overall atmosphere is ethereal, dramatic, and romantic, with a strong contrast between the deep reds and blues, heightened by cinematic lighting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Rose petals **drift** downwards, **accelerating** slightly as they **near** the viewer. The aisle's **distant luminescence** **intensifies** and **dims** **rhythmically**. The woman's wedding gown **undulates** and **shifts**, betraying **gentle forward momentum**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**CHAOTIC DYNAMIC VIDEO PROMPT:**\n\nExplosive burst of rose petals, spiraling upward and then violently scattering, as the woman's dress rips open into countless shimmering threads that whip around her. The brilliant light at the aisle's end erupts into blinding, strobing pulses, causing the theater chairs to convulse and shudder violently. The entire auditorium floor fractures and lunges, forcing her to leap as cracks snake towards her while the walls melt and reform like molten metal.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Rose petals defy gravity, swirling upward, then seamlessly transforming into glowing fireflies that congregate at the pulsating light. The theater seats ripple like water, shifting colors as the woman's dress unravels into stardust, reformulating the aisle into a shimmering pathway. Her footsteps, now echoes, cause the very air to warp and shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera glides low behind a woman in a swaying dress, red petals swirling around her feet as she ascends the theater aisle. As she nears the pulsating light, the camera slowly zooms to her back, then dramatically sweeps skyward, revealing a cascade of petals falling from the celestial blue light above. The stage illuminates with an ethereal glow as she reaches the top, turning gracefully towards the unknown.",
