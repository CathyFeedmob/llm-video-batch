  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:**\n\nA whimsical, surreal ant with a segmented brown body, large black expressive eyes, menacing mandibles, and spiky pink antennae. A feathered golden-brown plume arches from its back. It stands on dark, textured soil with vibrant orange spheres. A cluster of blue-green, coral-like growths is to its right. In the background, a large, translucent, subtly lit bubble-like structure creates a soft halo effect. Dominant warm browns with cool blue/green accents and pops of pink/orange. Dreamlike, soft glow lighting. Eye-level shot.",
