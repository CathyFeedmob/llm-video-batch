    "video_prompt": "Subtle rise and fall of chest suggesting breathing. Gentle swaying of hair, especially around the face and ponytail, as if caught in a light breeze. Faint shimmer on the white armor, mimicking shifting light. Eyes subtly shift and blink. Slight camera zoom and pan.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on recreating the visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere of the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A young woman with long, messy, reddish-brown hair, styled in a high ponytail with loose strands framing her face and a single braid hanging over her left shoulder. She has a serious or contemplative expression, with hints of dirt or faint marks on her face and neck.\n\n**Attire:** She is wearing a futuristic, form-fitting pilot suit or battlesuit. The suit is primarily off-white or dull white, with pronounced scuffs, dirt, and rust-like stains, indicating wear and tear. It features dark grey or black under-suit elements, and subtle orange or dark red accents around the collar and possibly on the shoulders/chest. The suit design includes segmented armor plating with smooth, rounded curves.\n\n**Composition & Pose:** A close-up, slightly off-center shot, focusing on her upper torso and head from the mid-chest up. She is looking off to the right (viewer's right) with her head slightly angled. Her left shoulder (viewer's left) is visible, showcasing the suit details and the braid. The composition creates a strong vertical line with her body and hair, drawing attention to her face.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:** Dramatic, soft, and somewhat dim lighting, with light sources seemingly coming from the upper right, casting subtle shadows and highlighting her features. The overall atmosphere is gritty, melancholic, and a bit desolate, hinting at a post-apocalyptic or battle-worn setting. The background is blurred and dark, almost black, with very subtle hints of indistinct shapes or structures, emphasizing the subject.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, highly detailed, and cinematic, with a focus on texture and depth. Emphasize subtle reflections on the suit and the natural flow of the hair. The overall aesthetic should be reminiscent of high-fidelity concept art or a still from a dark sci-fi film.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by muted and earthy tones: off-white, dark grey, reddish-brown, and subtle hints of orange/red. A limited, desaturated color palette enhances the dramatic and melancholic mood.\n\n**Camera:** Shallow depth of field, sharp focus on the subject.\n\n**Keywords:** C29, pilot suit, battlesuit, sci-fi, solemn, gritty, realistic, cinematic lighting, detailed, post-apocalyptic, long hair, braid, ponytail, weathered, worn, textured.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Chest gently rises and falls. Hair sways softly, a light breeze catching strands around face and ponytail. White armor subtly shimmers, reflecting shifting light. Eyes blink and subtly refocus. Camera slowly zooms and pans, revealing more of the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Hair wildly whips and snaps the ponytail, chest heaves violently with desperate gasps, entire armor suit visibly shudders and cracks as if under immense pressure. Eyes glow with intense, flickering energy, darting erratically. The camera whips around her, mimicking a frantic struggle, capturing explosive bursts of light and phantom debris. Dirt particles on face and armor intensely shimmer and shift, hinting at rapid decay and regeneration.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Chest pulses, revealing nebulae within. Hair strands unfurl into wisps of starlight, then writhe like sentient tendrils before solidifying into crystalline structures. Armor melts into liquid gold, pooling before reforming as a flock of hummingbirds. Eyes become galaxies, silently expanding and contracting, while the scene slowly inverts, sky swallowing ground, then folds into itself like origami.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in on her determined gaze. Head subtly tilts as breath deepens, hair softly swaying, then a sharp turn to the left, revealing the full extent of the dusty armor as the camera arcs around her. A single tear forms, catching the subtle light, then a fast, decisive blink. Chest rises and falls, conveying a deep, resolute inhale.",
