    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer on water reflection, gentle light flickering through buildings, very slow zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "A striking mixed-media artwork, evoking a city skyline against a backdrop of handwritten text, with a reflective quality that mirrors the city below.\n\n**Visual Elements:** The dominant feature is a stylized city skyline in silhouette, composed of various rectangular and angular buildings of differing heights and widths. The buildings range in color from solid black to various shades of gray, with some lighter cream/beige elements interspersed. Some buildings feature small, illuminated windows, indicated by light dots. Below the skyline, a reflection of the city is rendered semi-abstractly, with vertical brushstrokes and blurred shapes, giving the impression of water or a distorted mimicry of the above. The entire artwork is overlaid and underlaid with handwritten script in a flowing, cursive style, primarily in black or dark gray ink. The text appears to be older, perhaps historic, with some imperfections in ink saturation.\n\n**Style:** The style is abstract and mixed-media, combining architectural forms with calligraphic elements. It has a somewhat minimalistic yet detailed aesthetic. The contrast between the sharp edges of the buildings and the fluid lines of the text is prominent. The reflective quality adds a surreal or dreamlike aspect.\n\n**Composition:** The city occupies the upper half of the image, with the reflection filling the lower half. The handwritten text acts as a unifying background and foreground element, extending across the entire canvas. The buildings are arranged in a horizontal band, creating a dynamic silhouette. A black, calligraphic \"2020\" is prominently placed in the bottom right corner, adding a modern and artistic signature.\n\n**Colors:** The color palette is predominantly monochromatic, featuring black, various shades of gray (from light to dark charcoal), white (for the background paper), and subtle hints of cream or light beige within some buildings. The reflective bottom half incorporates slightly bluer-gray tones, enhancing the water-like effect.\n\n**Lighting:** The lighting is implied rather than explicit, suggesting an urban night or dusk scene, with the illuminated windows hinting at internal light sources. The overall impression is one of low-key lighting, enhancing the silhouette effect.\n\n**Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is contemplative, perhaps a bit melancholic, and sophisticated. The juxtaposition of the structured city and flowing text creates a sense of history, memory, and an urban narrative. It feels like an artistic commentary on human civilization and its relationship with time and environment.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nMinimalist mixed-media artwork, depicting a stylized city skyline silhouette in shades of black and dark gray across the top half of the canvas. Buildings feature distinct rectangular shapes and some subtle, small illuminated window details. Below the skyline, a blurred, semi-abstract reflection of the city in muted cool grays and blues creates a watery effect. The entire composition is overlaid with elegant, flowing handwritten cursive script in black ink, resembling historical documents. The background paper is a soft, off-white. A prominent, elegant calligraphic \"2020\" in black is in the bottom right corner. The overall mood is contemplative and sophisticated, with a strong emphasis on contrasting textures and a monochromatic color palette with subtle warm accents. Atmospheric, urban, reflective, modern calligraphy art.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few refined options, focusing exclusively on dynamic elements and concisely:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus: Overall Scene Movement):**\n> Water's surface subtly shimmers, light gently flickers across building facades, and the entire scene performs a very gradual, unhurried zoom out.\n\n**Option 2 (Focus: Specific Element Movement):**\n> Reflected light dances softly on the water. Shadows from passing light sources subtly shift across the buildings. The camera very slowly recedes.\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasis on Subtlety):**\n> A delicate ripple effect traverses the water's reflection. Intermittent glows softly pulse within the building architecture. The viewpoint imperceptibly enlarges its scope.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Inferno bursts from cityscape, reflections contort and writhe. Buildings rip from foundations, shattering the sky. Ink veins erupt from text, coiling like serpents. Water violently rips upward, transforming into a vortex. Light pulses, distorting reality. A cataclysmic symphony of chaos, relentlessly devouring the frame.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A shimmering city in reverse gravity, buildings stretch into a sky of flowing ink. Their reflections morph into script, rewriting themselves as they ascend, light escaping like whispers from dissolving windows. The entire scene gently expands inward, defying perspective, as time unravels.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The city skyline shimmers, its reflection distorting on the water below. A slow, dramatic zoom-out reveals a broader vista, as wisps of \"text\" peel from the buildings like ancient parchment, swirling into the air. The faint glow from the windows pulses, mirroring the rhythmic expansion of the abstract text, creating a surreal and unsettling ballet of light and form.",
