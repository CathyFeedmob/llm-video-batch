    "video_prompt": "Subtle camera zoom out, very slight horizontal pan right. Clouds gently drift across the sky. Distant flying vehicles slowly move across the cityscape and then out of frame. Lights on buildings subtly flicker. The glowing patterns on the person's back gently pulse.",
    "image_prompt": "An epic, highly detailed, photorealistic render of a lone figure in a futuristic armored suit, sitting cross-legged on the edge of a weathered, dark metal platform, overlooking a vast, sprawling cyberpunk metropolis at dusk.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Central Figure:** A single person wearing a grey and orange armored suit with glowing green and purple intricate patterns on the back, suggesting advanced technology. They are seen from behind, sitting in a meditative or contemplative pose.\n*   **Foreground:** The dark, textured metal platform with subtle engraved patterns, creating a sense of depth and height.\n*   **Midground:** A dense futuristic city with towering skyscrapers of various designs, some resembling brutalist architecture, others with organic curves. Many buildings feature glowing windows and neon lights in blues, greens, purples, and oranges. A large, dominant central skyscraper with a spired top stands out.\n*   **Vehicles:** Several aerial vehicles (likely hovercraft or spacecraft) are seen flying through the cityscape, emitting bright light from their thrusters. One prominent vehicle is closer to the left, another smaller one far right.\n*   **Sky:** A dramatic, cloudy sky with hints of a sunset glow on the horizon, transitioning into darker, ominous clouds overhead. There are patches of diffuse light breaking through the clouds.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Genre:** Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi, Dystopian, Futuristic.\n*   **Artistic Style:** Photorealistic, Digital Painting, Concept Art. High detail on textures, lighting, and reflections. Inspired by artists like Syd Mead, Bladerunner, or Ghost in the Shell.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Perspective:** Elevated, wide-angle shot from behind the figure, looking down and out over the city.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The figure is placed roughly on the left vertical third, and the horizon line is somewhat below the upper horizontal third, giving prominence to both the sky and the vast city below.\n*   **Depth:** Strong sense of depth created by the layered elements: foreground platform, midground city, and distant horizon/sky.\n*   **Leading Lines:** The edges of the platform subtly guide the eye towards the expansive city.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Palette:** A cool and dark palette of blues, teals, grays, and deep purples, contrasted with vibrant neon accents of green, magenta, orange, and electric blue from the city lights.\n*   **Sky Colors:** Dark, stormy blues and grays blending into warm oranges and purples on the horizon.\n*   **Figure Colors:** Muted orange and gray, with striking bright green and purple luminescence.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Overall:** Low light, twilight/dusk setting.\n*   **Source:** Primarily artificial light from the city (windows, neon signs), and ambient light from the sky.\n*   **Effects:** Atmospheric haze and mist create a soft glow around distant lights. Reflections of lights in wet or metallic surfaces in the city. The sky has volumetric lighting, with light breaking through clouds.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Contemplative, isolated, awe-inspiring, melancholic, epic, vast, futuristic, mysterious. A sense of the character being small but significant against the backdrop of a massive, advanced world.\n\n**Specific Details to Include in Prompt:**\n\"High detailed, photorealistic, 8K, cinematic volumetric lighting, epic concept art, digital painting, sci-fi, cyberpunk, detailed texture, atmospheric perspective, rain (or sense of moisture in the air), reflections, highly rendered.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera dolly out with a slow, rightward pan. Clouds drift. Distant vehicles cross the cityscape. Building lights flicker. Patterns on the person's back pulse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Camera whips back, sky churns violently. Megastructures rupture, sending debris hurtling. Flying vehicles erupt in chaotic bursts, careening into other buildings. The figure's back pulses with blinding, explosive light, radiating powerful energy waves that distort the city. Ground beneath them cracks open, revealing a glowing abyss. Buildings morph and extend, grasping skyward. The entire cityscape becomes a maelstrom of destruction and supernatural forces.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity inverts, launching the distant cityscape into the sky, then slowly raining down as shimmering, geometric petals. The person's back patterns blossom into aurora-like wings, carrying them through dissolving clouds into a void where stars swim like luminescent fish, before the entire scene folds inward like an origami universe.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera begins with a slow, dramatic push-in on the person, emphasizing the intricate glowing patterns on their back as they pulse. Suddenly, a fast, sweeping crane shot rises and arcs over the person, revealing the sprawling, futuristic cityscape and flying vehicles zipping past at an accelerated pace. Simultaneously, the city lights flicker intensely, creating a frenetic energy, while the massive, central skyscraper's pinnacle flashes brightly. The camera then performs a rapid, slightly shaky pull-back, ending on a wide shot of the person and the dynamic, futuristic environment.",
