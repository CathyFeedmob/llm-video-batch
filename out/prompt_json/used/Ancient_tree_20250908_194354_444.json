    "video_prompt": "The long-haired woman's green dress gently sways in a subtle breeze. Sunlight shimmers through the leaves of the ancient tree, casting dappled light that subtly shifts on the forest floor. A faint, almost imperceptible mist wisps through the distant trees.",
    "image_prompt": "A full, vertical shot of a woman with long red hair, seen from behind, wearing a flowing long green dress, stands on a sunlit path in a fantastical, ancient forest. The path is strewn with fallen leaves and small rocks, and patches of moss and small leafy plants grow on the ground, with sunlight dappling through the leaves of the towering trees. Her head is tilted slightly forward, suggesting she is looking up at something. \n\nThe focal point of the image is an enormous, colossal tree dominating the left side, with an incredibly thick trunk and massive, gnarled roots (buttress roots) that sprawl extensively across the forest floor, creating natural pathways and elevated areas. The tree's bark is textured and ancient, with some smaller leafy branches growing directly from its trunk and roots. The canopy of this tree reaches high above, with branches extending across the top of the frame, adorned with lush green foliage.\n\nThe forest extends into the background, showcasing more tall trees with straight, slender trunks, shrouded in a soft, ethereal mist or fog. The light is bright and hazy, filtering through the dense canopy, creating a dreamlike glow. The overall color palette is dominated by various shades of green, from the deep, dark greens of the tree trunks and roots to the lighter, vibrant greens of the foliage. The sunlight adds warm, golden tones to the ground and highlights the edges of the mist. The atmosphere is mystical, peaceful, and majestic.\n\n**Style**: Fantasy art, digital painting, highly detailed, realistic with a touch of surrealism.\n**Composition**: Rule of thirds applied, leading lines along the pathway towards the tree and into the forest, wide-angle and vertical for capturing the height of the tree.\n**Lighting**: Backlighting, dappled sunlight, volumetric lighting with misty elements.\n**Atmosphere**: Mystical, serene, awe-inspiring, ancient.\n**Resolution**: High resolution, ultra-detailed.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The woman's dress and hair noticeably sway. Light and shadows move across the forest floor. A gentle mist drifts through the background trees.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The long-haired woman's green dress violently whips in a sudden gale, the fabric tearing. The ancient tree's roots erupt from the earth, convulsing and grasping while branches explode into splintered shards. Sunlight shatters into blinding flashes, igniting the forest floor in a chaotic dance of light and shadow. A powerful, swirling vortex of mist consumes the distant trees, twisting them into grotesque forms. The ground beneath her buckles and cracks.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The ancient tree's roots uproot and dance, twisting into serpentine forms that lift the woman into the air. Her dress transforms into flowing mist, coalescing into wings that beat silently. The sunlight refracts into liquid rainbows, dripping upwards into the shifting canopy as distant trees stretch and compress like accordions. The entire forest pulses with an ethereal, impossible rhythm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly dollies back from the woman, revealing the immense scale of the ancient tree, its roots twisting like ancient veins. As sunlight streaks through misty air, a dramatic breeze causes her emerald dress to ripple, catching the light like liquid. The camera then gracefully arcs around her, revealing the ethereal, dappled forest and highlighting the profound solitude.",
