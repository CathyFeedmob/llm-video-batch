    "video_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise, suitable for a video generation model:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Comprehensive):**\n\n```\nGenerate a video: A lone figure in a dark hooded coat walks slowly down the center of a wide, wet, reflective urban street. The camera tracks slowly from behind and below them, looking up towards immense, towering suspension bridge structures and elevated roadways that dominate the frame. Bright, warm yellow-orange car headlights cast strong reflections on the wet pavement, contrasting with a heavy atmospheric haze that blurs the distant city. The scene is rendered in an atmospheric, melancholic anime/concept art style, using a muted palette of cool blues, teals, and pale yellow-green/cream, with soft, diffuse lighting.\n```\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\n```\nVideo: A lone figure walks slowly away on a wide, wet, reflective urban street. Low-angle camera tracks from behind, looking up at colossal suspension bridge towers and elevated roadways. Bright car headlights glow and reflect on the pavement through heavy atmospheric haze. Melancholic anime/concept art style with muted cool blues, teals, and pale yellow-green light.\n```\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise - high-level summary):**\n\n```\nVideo: Melancholic anime style. Lone figure walks on wet street under immense, hazy bridge structures. Low-angle tracking shot from behind. Muted blues/teals, warm headlight reflections.\n```\n\n**Recommended:** Option 1 or 2 provides the best balance of detail for a video model to capture the nuances. Option 1 is likely the most effective if the model can handle longer prompts, as it explicitly guides the camera movement and overall mood.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt suitable for an image generation model:\n\n\"A striking digital illustration in an anime/concept art style. Dramatic low-angle, one-point perspective looking up at colossal, towering bridge structures that dominate the upper frame. A lone figure walks away from the viewer down the center of a wide, wet urban street, flanked by cars with warm headlights casting strong reflections. Muted cool blues and teals define the structures, contrasted with a soft, ethereal pale yellow-green/cream sky and heavy atmospheric haze. Diffuse, soft lighting creates a melancholic, dreamlike, solitary, and vast urban landscape.\""
