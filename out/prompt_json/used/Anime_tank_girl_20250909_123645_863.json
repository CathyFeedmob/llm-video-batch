    "video_prompt": "A subtle camera zoom out reveals the full scope of the scene. The eyes of the character gently blink, and her chest slowly rises and falls as if breathing. The small piece of hair near her left temple sways slightly. Light glints softly off the metallic parts of her armor and the tank's barrel, creating a subtle shimmers. Tiny specks of dust slowly float around the scene, catching the light. The tank's rusty patches subtly shimmer with a faint, almost imperceptible glow.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Full-body illustration by C29 of an anime-style female tank crew member in a military-green armored suit, standing in front of a heavily rusted, abandoned WWII-era tank (possibly a Panzer IV or similar, with a visible white cross and side-mounted smoke dischargers).**\n\n**Character:** The girl has short, light brown hair with a hair clip, and warm, expressive brown eyes. She wears a form-fitting, slightly futuristic, militaristic-green armored suit with visible joints, straps, and some chest padding. The suit shows signs of wear and rust, matching the tank's aesthetic. She holds a compact, multi-barreled futuristic shotgun or grenade launcher in her right hand, pointed downwards. Her left leg is partially exposed, revealing pale skin and muscle tone, contrasting with the armored suit.\n\n**Tank:** The tank is a dominant background element, heavily detailed with chipping paint and significant rust, giving it a mottled green and brown appearance. The main gun barrel is prominent, with detailed muzzle brake. The turret has an \"FMAC 194\" marking (possibly \"FMAC 1940\" partially visible) and a small hatch. On the side, there are multiple cylindrical smoke dischargers. The tracks and road wheels are visible, also showing rust.\n\n**Composition & Style:** The character is centered in the foreground, looking directly at the viewer with a slight, confident smirk. The tank is positioned behind her, slightly offset to the right, creating depth. The art style is a blend of detailed military realism with anime aesthetics, characterized by sharp lines, subtle watercolor textures, and a slightly muted but rich color palette. The overall atmosphere is gritty and post-apocalyptic, yet with a hint of resilience.\n\n**Colors & Lighting:** Dominant colors are military green, various shades of rust brown, and off-white for the background. Skin tones are natural and pale. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting textures and details without harsh shadows, suggesting an overcast day or studio lighting. The white background emphasizes the subject.\n\n**Inspiration Artists/Styles:** C29, Anime Illustration, Military Art, Grungy Aesthetic, Watercolor elements.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera subtly zooms out. Character's eyes gently blink, chest slowly rises and falls with breathing. Hair near left temple sways slightly. Light glints softly off armor and tank barrel, creating subtle shimmers. Tiny dust motes slowly float. Rusty tank patches subtly glow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The character's eyes snap wide open, glaring, as her chest violently convulses. Her hair whips wildly, lashing out. The tank's cannon violently pivots and fires a blinding, concussive blast, shaking the ground. The rust on the tank suddenly peels away and reforms into grotesque, writhing tendrils that lash out at the viewer. Dust clouds explode outwards, revealing a swirling, chaotic vortex behind the tank.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The tank's rust blooms into vibrant, flowing moss, consuming the character's armor as she dissolves into a metallic shimmer. Her rifle extends into branching roots, while her body transforms into an ethereal constellation of drifting stars, slowly re-forming the tank in reverse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms out, revealing the tactical suit’s intricate details as the tank’s rusted facade dominates the background. The character’s eyes slowly open, a subtle glint reflecting the tank's barrel. She then subtly raises her rifle, its metallic gleam catching the faint light. As tiny dust motes dance in the air, the tank’s rusty exterior subtly shifts, creating an ethereal glow. The camera slowly pans, showcasing the full scope of this weathered battle-ready scene.",
