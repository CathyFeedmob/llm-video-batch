    "video_prompt": "A bomber plane slightly banks right as its propeller glints with a subtle, circular motion. The water below the ships subtly ripples and creates white foamy wakes. Smoke billows more intensely from the ships' funnels and disperses slowly. The bunny pilot's ears twitch slightly, and a subtle breath causes its chest to rise and fall. Distant muzzle flashes from the ships faintly illuminate the sea. The camera experiences a very slow, almost imperceptible dolly forward, slightly enhancing depth.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA stylized, dynamic illustration from a first-person perspective inside a vintage propeller-driven fighter aircraft. The cockpit canopy is open, revealing a anthropomorphic rabbit pilot wearing a brown leather flight jacket, white fur collar, and harness, gripping the control stick. The rabbit has large, expressive eyes and a slightly open mouth, looking forward.\n\nBelow and to the right, a large grey naval warship with multiple smokestacks and superstructure, including a prominent mast, is cruising left-to-right on a choppy, light blue-grey sea, leaving a white wake. Dark smoke billows from its smokestacks. Further back and to the left, another smaller warship is visible, also emitting smoke.\n\nIn the upper-right background, another flying object, possibly a small bomber or drone, is engulfed in dark smoke, appearing to be hit or crashing, leaving a trail of smoke behind it. Bright muzzle flashes or shell impacts are visible on the water near the large warship, suggesting naval gunfire or aerial attacks.\n\nThe sky is a warm gradient of light yellow to orange, indicative of sunrise or sunset, casting a soft, golden light over the scene. The overall color palette is muted and realistic, with browns, greys, and blues dominating, accented by the warm sky. The art style has a detailed painterly quality, reminiscent of concept art or historical aviation paintings, with a slightly whimsical, fantastical element due to the animal pilot. The scene evokes a sense of action and adventure, with the rabbit pilot at the heart of it. The propeller of the aircraft is a red and white blur, conveying motion.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The bomber banks right, propellor glinting. Water subtly ripples, creating foamy wakes. Smoke billows intensely from ships, dispersing slowly. Bunny pilot's ears twitch, chest rises/falls with breath. Distant muzzle flashes illuminate the sea. Camera imperceptibly dollies forward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The bomber plane wildly lurches right, propeller blades violently blurring, scattering water into explosive splashes below the ships. Their foamy wakes erupt into chaotic, crashing waves. Black smoke violently erupts from funnels, swirling into rapid, suffocating clouds. The bunny pilot's ears snap back, eyes wide, as its entire body jolts forward. Intense muzzle flashes rip across the sea, momentarily blinding the view. The camera violently shakes and zooms forward, plunging into the action.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The bomber plane undulates like a ribbon, its propeller melting into sentient light. Water below the ships crystalizes, forming gravity-defying spirals that ascend into the sky. Smoke from funnels solidifies into colossal, twisting trees that bloom fire. The bunny pilot's ears transform into ethereal wings, beating in reverse, while its chest distorts into a kaleidoscope of swirling nebulae. Distant muzzle flashes ripple backward, creating inverse-light illusions. The camera, now a living entity, breathes in the impossible scene, shifting dimensions with each pulse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The fighter plane, piloted by a brave rabbit, dramatically banks right as the propeller glints in a rapid circular motion. The ship's powerful guns fire, illuminating the dark sea as the camera quickly zooms in on the bunny's brave face, its ears twitching slightly. The ships leave long, foamy wakes in their path, adding a feeling of speed and movement.",
