    "video_prompt": "Gentle rain falling and striking surfaces, producing subtle ripples in puddles. Soft light reflections shimmer on the wet pavement. Distant lights subtly flicker.",
    "image_prompt": "A captivating cinematic still of a rainy urban street scene at dusk, looking down a wide, wet sidewalk paved with dark, reflective tiles. The perspective is low-angle, close to the ground, emphasizing the reflective quality of the wet surfaces. Rain streaks are visible throughout the image, creating a sense of movement and atmosphere.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Foreground (left):** A dense green bush with fresh-looking leaves, some visibly wet, adds a touch of nature.\n*   **Midground:** The wet, dark paved sidewalk stretches into the distance, reflecting the ambient light and streetlights. Small, shimmering puddles and water droplets are scattered across the tiles.\n*   **Background (left to right):** A blurred street with glowing, out-of-focus streetlights and building lights. Tall, dark buildings line both sides of the street, their facades partially obscured by rain and atmospheric haze.\n*   **Water reflections:** Prominent reflections of leaves, building forms, and lights are visible in the puddles on the ground.\n\n**Style:**\nCinematic, photorealistic, atmospheric, moody.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The bush is placed roughly in the lower-left third, and the street extends into the central and right thirds.\n*   **Leading Lines:** The paved sidewalk creates strong leading lines that draw the eye towards the distant, blurred streetlights.\n*   **Depth of Field:** A shallow depth of field, with the foreground bush and sidewalk sharply in focus, while the background buildings and lights are soft and blurred, creating a bokeh effect.\n*   **Low Angle Shot:** The camera is positioned very low, almost at ground level, giving a unique perspective on the wet street and reflections.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant tones:** Cool blues, grays, and dark greens for the sky, buildings, and plants.\n*   **Accent colors:** Warm oranges, yellows, and amber from the streetlights and reflections, creating a striking contrast against the cool tones.\n*   **Reflective surfaces:** The wet ground introduces additional color and light from reflections.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Natural Lighting:** Overcast, diffused light from the rainy sky.\n*   **Artificial Lighting:** Prominent, warm streetlights and building lights are blurred into bokeh or soft glows, illuminating the wet surfaces and creating a sense of depth. Light reflects off the wet pavement, creating shimmering patterns.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nSerene, contemplative, calm, peaceful, cozy, urban, melancholic. The rain and reflections evoke a quiet, introspective mood.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Raindrops **pitter-patter**, creating **oscillating ripples** on puddles. **Glimmering reflections** of light **dance** on the wet ground. Distant lights **flicker** with varying intensity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Deluge descends, each drop a percussive strike, pavement erupting in splashes. Buildings warp and undulate, streetlights morph into pulsating flares. Puddles churn into violent whirlpools, reflecting a sky rent by unseen forces. Rain streaks morph into whip-like tendrils, grasping and lashing. Static elements seize with explosive force, shattering and reforming as liquid light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Raindrops defy gravity, cascading **upwards** into the sky, each droplet shimmering with the impossible glow of a nascent star. Puddles on the pavement become mirrors reflecting a reversed world, rippling **inward** to absorb light, only to then **expel** it as ethereal mist. Distant city lights **dance in reverse**, their beams unraveling into ghostly tendrils that coil and writhe before vanishing into nothingness. The wet pavement **undulates slowly**, transforming into liquid glass that stretches and shrinks, carrying reflections from a forgotten dimension.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Mist-shrouded cityscape as torrential rain violently lashes the slick pavement. A dramatic low-angle push-in on a shimmering puddle, revealing a lone figure sprinting past in a desperate, blurry dash. Jagged streaks of lightning briefly illuminate the urban canyon as the camera cranes up, following the frantic run towards an unseen sanctuary.",
