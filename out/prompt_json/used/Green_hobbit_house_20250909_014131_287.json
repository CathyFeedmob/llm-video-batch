    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze sways the trees in the background and causes the grass on the house's roof to subtly ripple. The yellow flowers on the roof and water lilies on the pond gently bob. The water in the pond shows light ripples and reflections, with subtle movement from unseen water creatures. The cute white creatures on the deck and in the window occasionally blink their eyes. The small pumpkin on the deck subtly glows with a soft, internal light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA vibrant, whimsical illustration of a moss-covered hobbit-hole style house, featuring a rounded, grassy roof adorned with scattered small yellow flowers. The house is painted in a bright, cheerful green with multiple windows and an arched entryway. It sits on a round wooden deck extending over a serene, dark green pond filled with lily pads and blooming yellow water lilies. On the wooden deck, several smooth, white, rounded creatures resembling seals or marshmallows are playfully positioned. One is visible inside a window. A large, bright orange pumpkin rests on the deck beside the house. The scene is set within a dense, lush green forest with towering trees and a slight misty atmosphere in the background, suggesting depth. The lighting is soft and natural, emphasizing the vibrant greens and the cheerful yellow and orange accents. The overall atmosphere is magical, peaceful, and inviting, like a storybook setting. The style is 3D illustration, highly detailed, and inviting.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Trees sway as grass ripples on the roof. Flowers and lilies bob. Water subtly ripples, showing reflections and unseen creature movement. White creatures blink. A pumpkin softly glows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Trees violently thrash, branches whipping overhead. The house roof bursts open, spewing grass and flowers skyward. Water in the pond transforms into a raging vortex, devouring lily pads and revealing thrashing, monstrous creatures. The cute white creatures on the deck and in the window morph into snarling beasts, eyes blazing, lunging at the viewer. The pumpkin explodes into a blinding inferno, engulfing the deck.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The green house, a living entity, pulsates gently, its grass roof inhaling and exhaling, causing yellow flowers to blossom and recede. The water in the pond flows upwards, reversing into the water lilies, which then sprout into flying fish. The white creature in the window blinks, distorting the glass into a kaleidoscope, as a pumpkin on the deck morphs into a giant eye, watching the trees in the background dance into abstract patterns.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, sweeping crane shot reveals the verdant forest, culminating in a dramatic zoom-in on the mossy green house. A soft breeze stirs the roof's grass and yellow flowers, subtly rippling the pond's surface, reflecting the gently swaying trees. Three cute white creatures on the deck and one in the window blink intermittently. The small pumpkin pulses with a warm, internal glow. The quiet scene is alive with gentle, rhythmic movements.",
