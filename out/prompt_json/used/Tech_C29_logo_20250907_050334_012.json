    "video_prompt": "Subtle glow and pulse of the orange and teal lines within the \"c29\" text. Faint flickering of the digital numbers (2, 9, 3) in the background. Gentle drift and fade of the small dots and connecting lines. Subtle gleam shifting across the metallic surfaces of the \"c29\" logo. Slow, almost imperceptible zoom out or a slight parallax shift in the background elements.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Detailed Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n\"A sleek, futuristic dark-grey background with subtle glowing orange and light-blue vertical and horizontal lines, resembling a digital circuit board or data stream. Scattered translucent holographic numbers (2, 3, 9) appear in the background, some blurred, some sharper. The central focus is a large, stylized 3D metallic rendering of \"c29\". The 'c' and '9' are silver with internal cutouts revealing intricate, brightly glowing orange and cyan circuit board patterns. The '2' is a more industrial silver, with visible bolts and panel lines, incorporating a visible, light-colored mechanical gear mechanism in its lower curve. The '9' also has glowing cyan data streams extending downwards from its base, reminiscent of light trails. The overall composition is a dynamic, vertical orientation. Lighting is dim with strong internal glows from the circuit elements and the data streams, creating a high-tech, slightly mysterious atmosphere. A smaller, stylized \"c29\" in a warm, desaturated orange font is in the bottom right corner.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here's a refined prompt focusing *exclusively* on motion and change, concise and under 100 words:\n\nSubtle orange and teal lines within \"c29\" gently pulse and glow. Digital numbers (2, 9, 3) in the background faintly flicker. Small dots and connecting lines drift and subtly fade. A soft gleam shifts across the \"c29\" logo's metallic surfaces. Background elements experience a slow, near-imperceptible zoom out and slight parallax shift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The \"c29\" characters violently fracture, revealing searing orange and electric teal energy bursts. Digital numbers in the background rapidly glitch, distort, and then shatter into fragmented data streams that whip across the screen. The small dots rapidly multiply, forming chaotic, glowing networks that explode outwards. Metallic surfaces of the logo ripple and contort, molten and pulsing with internal light. The background violently tears apart, revealing an abyss of pure data.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The \"c29\" metal warps into liquid chrome, the circuit lines detaching and forming ethereal, glowing geometric patterns that drift upwards like sentient sparks. Background numbers pulse in a liquid aurora, reversing order as their shapes deconstruct into falling dust motes. Connecting lines twist and knot, then unfurl as shimmering filaments that coil around the geometric forms. The entire scene slowly inverts, mirroring itself upside down, then rights itself, leaving behind shimmering afterimages.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Start with a slow, cinematic push-in on the \"c\" of \"c29\", its orange and teal lines subtly glowing.** As the camera smoothly reveals the \"2\", a soft, rhythmic pulse emanates from its metallic surfaces, then abruptly shifts to a rapid, short-burst flicker in the ghostly background digits, hinting at urgent data processing. The camera then *dramatically* pulls back and rotates to reveal the entire \"c29\" logo, the \"9\" cascading with vibrant, neon-blue data streams that drip down like liquid light. The background dots and lines, previously static, subtly shift and flow like an unseen current, guiding the eye. Finally, a *swift, almost imperceptible* lateral drift of the background elements, like a ghost in the machine, adds a layer of mystery before the shot gracefully settles.",
