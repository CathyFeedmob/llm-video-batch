  "video_prompt": "A central golden light sphere effervesces and pulses like an active network, with small reflective bubbles gently drifting around it. Luminous golden tendrils subtly expand and flow outwards, displaying dynamic electrical currents and data transfer. Scattered reflective orbs slowly rotate and shift, their surfaces shimmering. The background atmosphere subtly transitions and undulates. Faint grid patterns and distant glows pulse and morph in the upper half, while golden mist swirls below as futuristic structures slowly emerge, their lights subtly brightening and dimming. The reflective surface below gently ripples.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n\"Highly detailed, high-contrast, vertically oriented image of an intricate, futuristic biomechanical network. Dominant palette: deep dark blues and blacks shifting to warm, glowing golds and yellows.\n\nAt the core, a large, intensely illuminated translucent sphere, shimmering with countless effervescent golden light points like a miniature city grid or network nodes. Small reflective bubbles cling to its surface.\n\nFrom this core, luminous golden-yellow tendrils, accented with bright white and pale blue highlights suggesting electrical flow, emanate and intricately wrap, forming a dense, curvilinear web that extends dynamically towards the edges.\n\nScattered throughout are perfectly spherical, highly reflective orbs of varying sizes, mirroring the scene's intense light, some seemingly attached to the tendrils.\n\nUpper background: Deep, inky cosmic space featuring faint grid patterns, distant glows, and tiny golden pinpricks. Lower background: A warm, golden-hued atmosphere with soft luminous haze. Dark, angular futuristic buildings or monolithic data centers rise from the mist on the left, their windows glowing. A reflective surface at the very bottom mirrors the warm light.\n\nThe overall mood is technological wonder and intricate complexity, blending organic and artificial elements, evoking advanced data networks and cosmic structures.\"",
