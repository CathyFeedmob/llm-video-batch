    "video_prompt": "Subtle flickering in the neon lights on buildings and trains, gentle shimmer in the water reflections, and a very slow, almost imperceptible dolly zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, highly detailed, vertical shot of a futuristic cyberpunk city at dusk, with two sleek, modern trains (like trams or light rail) on parallel tracks, reflecting in the wet, neon-lit ground.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Trains:** Two modern, streamlined trains. The train on the left is closer, filling the left side of the frame, showing stylized pink and blue glowing text/graffiti. The train on the right is further away, on the right side of the frame, detailed with pulsing pink and blue neon lights outlining its form and intricate, glowing abstract patterns on its side.\n*   **Cityscape:** Tall, dense buildings line both sides of the tracks, receding into the misty distance. The buildings are adorned with numerous neon signs in various shapes, sizes, and colors (predominantly bright cyan, pink, and yellow-orange), some with indecipherable text/characters.\n*   **Ground:** Wet, reflective ground, appearing like a street or platform, reflecting the neon lights of the trains and buildings intensely. There are subtle textures of standing water and grime.\n*   **Lights/Effects:** Strong neon glow emanates from the trains, signs, and ground reflections. There are thin, glowing lines on the tracks, particularly a bright yellow line on the right track and a fainter orange line on the left. Subtle mist or atmospheric haze gives depth to the city.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Cyberpunk, futuristic, sci-fi.\n*   Photorealistic with a touch of stylized art (for the neon elements and train designs).\n*   High detail, sharp focus.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Perspective:** Low-angle, almost at ground level, looking up slightly, creating an immersive, grand scale.\n*   **Arrangement:** The two trains create strong leading lines, guiding the eye into the depth of the image. The buildings form a canyon-like effect. The reflection on the wet ground mirrors the upper scene, adding symmetry and visual interest.\n*   **Rule of Thirds/Symmetry:** The trains are positioned to create a dynamic, balanced composition.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant:** Vibrant neon pink, electric cyan/blue, and glowing yellow-orange.\n*   **Background/Atmosphere:** Deep blues, dark greys, and blacks for the sky and unlit parts of the buildings, creating high contrast with the bright neon.\n*   **Reflections:** Intense, distorted reflections of all the dominant neon colors on the wet surface.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Source:** Primarily artificial neon light from signs, train exteriors, and ground illumination.\n*   **Quality:** Emissive, glowing, casting strong reflections.\n*   **Mood:** Atmospheric, mysterious, energetic, futuristic.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Rainy/wet, late evening or night.\n*   Lively, bustling, high-tech, slightly gritty.\n*   Evoking a sense of a living, breathing futuristic metropolis.\n\n**Camera:**\n*   **Lens:** Wide-angle to capture the expansive cityscape and trains.\n*   **Depth of Field:** Shallow to moderate, with the immediate foreground and closer train in sharp focus, and the background subtly fading into atmospheric depth.\n\n**Keywords:**\nCyberpunk city, neon lights, futuristic trains, wet ground, reflections, glowing, high contrast, blue and pink, orange, vertical shot, photorealistic, atmospheric, urban, sci-fi, dynamic lighting, low angle.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle neon flicker on buildings and trains, gentle water shimmer, imperceptible dolly zoom out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Aggressively flickering neon lights explode and warp on buildings, illuminating their sudden, violent contortions. Trains on both sides lurch forward, rocketing towards each other with intense, unpredictable speeds. The water on the tracks violently churns and splashes, reflecting distorted, streaking light trails as if the substance itself is alive. The entire scene pulsates with chaotic energy, threatening to rip apart.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Neon light *ripples* outwards from buildings, *absorbing* into the trains as they dematerialize into glowing mist. Water reflections *fracture* into shimmering portals, pulling the *upside-down city* into their depths.  *Geometric shapes* bloom from the train tracks, extending into *impossible angles* that warp the perspective, while the entire scene slowly *unfurls* from a single point, revealing an *infinite, pulsating void* in the distance.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, sweeping crane shot begins, framing the bustling neon street and moving slowly towards the horizon. As it descends, a high-speed tilt reveals the intricate details of a passing train, its neon lights pulsing subtly. The camera then smoothly dollies back, capturing the serene reflections of the vibrant city in the wet ground, creating a visually stunning, almost dreamlike sequence. A final, slow push-in on a shimmering puddle intensifies the cinematic mood, leaving the viewer lost in the city's ethereal glow.",
