    "video_prompt": "Subtle stellar glimmers and nebulae shifts in the background. The glowing ring of the stargate gently pulses with internal energy. The spaceship's blue thrusters emit a soft, wavering glow. A slow, almost imperceptible camera push-in enhances depth.",
    "image_prompt": "A space opera scene with a highly detailed, technologically advanced, and large spaceship traversing a shimmering, glowing wormhole-like ring structure in the vast expanse of space.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n*   **Spaceship:** A sleek, elongated, dark grey metallic spaceship with intricate paneling, blue glowing thrusters at the front and back, and numerous bright orange and blue lights along its hull. It should appear to be actively navigating or firing through the center of the ring.\n*   **Ring Structure:** A massive, ancient-looking, dark metallic ring or gate, composed of smaller, repeating rectangular segments. The interior of the ring is filled with a dense, shimmering field of bright, golden, glowing energy particles, resembling a star-filled tunnel or wormhole.\n*   **Space Background:** A dark and deep space backdrop, but not entirely black. It should feature nebulous clouds in shades of muted blue, purple, and hints of orange-brown, especially towards the edges and corners, suggesting distant galaxies or gas clouds.\n*   **Stars:** Numerous, varied stars of different sizes and intensities scattered throughout the background. Some stars are small and faint, while others are large and emit significant light flares and glows, particularly near the ring.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:**\n\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The spaceship and the ring should be centrally placed but with dynamic angling. The spaceship is positioned horizontally, passing through the vertical ring.\n*   **Dynamic Angle:** A slightly upward or downward tilt, giving a sense of scale and depth.\n*   **Depth of Field:** The spaceship and the ring are sharply in focus, while the background nebula and stars have a slight artistic blur to enhance depth.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   **Dominant:** Dark greys, bright gold/orange, and deep blues.\n*   **Accents:** Muted purples, light blues, and soft browns in the stellar background.\n*   **Contrast:** Strong contrast between the dark metallic structures and the brilliant glowing elements.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n*   **Primary Light Source:** The glowing energy within the ring acts as a primary light source, illuminating the spaceship and parts of the ring itself with bright golden light.\n*   **Secondary Light Sources:** Bright stars in the background contribute soft rim lighting and overall illumination of the distant cosmic elements.\n*   **Glow:** Prominent glows around the spaceship's thrusters and within the ring's energy field.\n*   **Reflections:** Subtle metallic reflections and highlights on the spaceship's hull due to the ring's light.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Epic & Grand:** Conveys a sense of vast discovery or a critical mission.\n*   **Mysterious & Awe-Inspiring:** The unknown purpose of the ring, coupled with the immense scale of space.\n*   **Technological & Sci-Fi:** Emphasizes advanced alien or human technology.\n\n**Art Style & Technique:**\n\n*   **Digital Painting:** Realistic yet stylized, with attention to intricate details.\n*   **High Resolution:** Sharp details on the spaceship and ring.\n*   **Cinematic:** Evokes a feeling of a still from a high-budget sci-fi film.\n*   **Highly Detailed:** Emphasis on the intricate design of both the spaceship and the ring.\n\n**Overall Prompt Structure:**\n\n\"Epic cinematic digital painting, highly detailed, a sleek, dark grey spaceship with glowing blue and orange lights navigating a colossal, ancient metallic ring. The ring's interior pulses with shimmering golden energy, creating a wormhole effect. In the background a sprawling nebula in muted blues, purples, and browns, filled with numerous sharp stars and bright starbursts. Deep space opera atmosphere, dynamic perspective with strong backlighting from the ring, volumetric lighting, realistic reflections, 8K, rendered in Unreal Engine, Octane Render.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The cosmos subtly shimmers and nebulae gracefully drift. The stargate's internal energy gently pulses, causing its glow to ebb and flow. The spaceship's blue thrusters softly waver as the camera slowly pushes in.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Stargate's glowing ring EXPLODES with light, pulsing violently as if tearing through reality. The spaceship's blue thrusters FLARE, launching it like a dart, accelerating with a guttural ROAR. The camera doesn't push; it lunges, SWIRLING around the stargate as the nebula writhes, constellations SHATTERING into blinding light, consumed by a gravitational singularity. Every star in the sky STREAKS and BLURS, pulled into the vortex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravitational currents swirl, pulling the stargate into a collapsing spiral of light, its glowing ring rippling like water. The spaceship, no longer propelled by thrusters, etherealizes into a fleeting constellation, leaving a trail of shimmering cosmic dust that rewinds into nascent nebulae, while stars bloom and wilt in impossible time.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A solitary spaceship slowly emerges from the void, its blue thrusters pulsing as it approaches a colossal, glowing stargate. Cinematic dolly zoom as the ship enters the shimmering portal, its lights intensifying. The camera sweeps backward, revealing the stargate's vastness against swirling nebulae and distant stars. A final, slow push-in as the portal's energy engulfs the ship, promising adventure beyond.",
