    "video_prompt": "A woman's contemplative expression subtly shifts, hinting at evolving resilience. Her wind-blown hair continuously sweeps across her face and flows outwards. Gentle snow falls, accumulating on her fur-lined hood and shoulders. The background dynamically transforms with swirling watercolor washes of blues, grays, and whites, constantly bleeding and dripping outwards, creating an ethereal, cold environment. Her form, particularly her hair and coat, slowly dissolves into these painterly abstractions, then reforms, emphasizing the dreamlike movement.",
    "image_prompt": "An expressive watercolor portrait of a woman with realistic, highly detailed facial features. She is depicted chest-up, gazing intently at the viewer with captivating light-colored eyes and a serene, contemplative expression. Her long, windblown light hair, with strands sweeping across her face, is dusted with snow. She wears a muted winter parka with a thick, reddish-brown fur-lined hood, also flecked with snow. The background is an ethereal, dynamic watercolor abstraction of cool blues, grays, and whites, with visible brushstrokes, soft blends, and expressive drips and splatters. Her form softly dissolves into these painterly washes, creating a striking contrast between the detailed face and the abstract, dreamlike environment, conveying raw beauty and strength in a cold setting."
