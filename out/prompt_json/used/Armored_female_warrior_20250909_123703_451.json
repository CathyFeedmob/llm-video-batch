    "video_prompt": "A subtle, almost imperceptible sway of the character's body, hinting at a gentle weight shift or a light breeze. The small debris particles near the bottom right of the image slowly drift and settle downwards. A very slight, almost unnoticeable flicker or glint on the metallic surfaces, particularly on the shoulder armor and the gun barrel, suggesting subtle changes in ambient light or reflective properties of worn metal.",
    "image_prompt": "A female figure, appearing to be a young woman with fair skin and short, dark hair, is depicted in a medium shot, facing slightly to the right with a direct, serious gaze. She is wearing heavily armored power suit, in a light blue color with extensive rust and wear patterns across its surface, suggesting a weathered or post-apocalyptic aesthetic. The suit features visible joints and segments, and on her right shoulder is a mounted, forward-facing weapon resembling a cannon or turret. A small antenna is visible on the upper left side of her suit. The background is pure white and minimalist. The art style combines elements of anime or manga with a realistic painted texture, using watercolor-like soft edges and details for the face contrasting with the sharper lines and textures of the armor. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the details of both the face and the armor. In the bottom right corner, there are text overlays: \"FMAacc 1964\" and a large \"C29\" in a bold, brush-stroke-like font.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Character subtly sways, implying gentle weight shift or breeze. Debris particles near bottom right drift and settle. Metallic surfaces—shoulder armor, gun barrel—flicker or glint faintly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive rupture of the armored plates, shrapnel and rust fragments violently propelled outwards! The heavy cannon barrel snaps and whirls, targeting an unseen threat. The character's body lurches and contorts, bracing for impact. Debris explodes upwards, defying gravity. Metallic surfaces flare with blinding, strobing light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The rust flakes coalesce and rise, forming intricate, metallic butterflies that flutter around her. The rifle barrel softens, twisting into a vine covered in bioluminescent blooms. Her shadow separates, becoming a translucent, shimmering duplicate that dances independently. Gravity warps, pulling fine debris upwards into an ethereal dust cloud, while her armored body subtly shimmers, hinting at a liquid core within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow 360-degree orbit around the formidable character, revealing subtle reflections glinting on her weathered blue armor and gun barrel. As the camera encircles, tiny debris particles near her feet begin to stir, then swirl upwards, creating an ethereal dust cloud around her. Her head barely inclines, eyes fixed, as if sensing an unseen presence.",
