    "video_prompt": "Subtle flickering of building lights and billboard animations, gentle swaying of distant trees, steam rising from grates; soft pulsations from UFO lights, with a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom into the cityscape. The robot figure's head lights dimly pulse.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired cityscape at dusk, looking down a wide city street. Tall, modern skyscrapers dominate the skyline, many with glowing windows and vertical light accents. The sky is a gradient of soft orange, pink, and purple, transitioning to a deeper blue above. Numerous sleek, metallic UFOs, glowing with blue and purple lights, hover at various altitudes between the buildings, with the largest ones closer to the foreground.\n\nThe street level is bustling with activity. On the right, a wide sidewalk is filled with a diverse crowd of pedestrians walking towards the viewer, including one prominent, highly reflective silver humanoid robot viewed from behind, wearing a sleek metallic suit. On the left, a multi-lane road features several futuristic, low-slung cars with glowing blue headlights and taillights. The closest car is silver-blue with prominent horizontal light bars. The wet asphalt street reflects the neon lights from the buildings and the cars, with streaks of blue, pink, and orange.\n\nBuildings lining the street feature numerous large, brightly illuminated neon signs in various colors (blue, pink, orange, purple). Many signs prominently display a stylized \"B\" logo, glowing neon green or orange, likely representing Bitcoin. Street lamps with warm, yellow light punctuate the sidewalks, interspersed with small trees. The overall lighting is dim but vibrant, with strong contrasts between the neon lights and the growing evening darkness, creating a dynamic, energetic atmosphere. The perspective is a long, slightly elevated shot looking down the street, emphasizing the depth and towering scale of the city. In the bottom right corner, a small, glowing teal \"c29\" logo is subtly placed.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Video Prompt:** Exploding storefronts violently shatter, billboard animations dramatically strobe and glitch, unleashing erratic bursts of light across the street. UFO lights aggressively flare and pulsate with blinding intensity, rapidly descending then darting erratically. The robot figure powerfully lunges forward, its head lights rapidly strobing as it transforms mid-stride. Buildings warp and twist, shattering into debris around the viewer. Cars speed past in a blur, leaving glowing trails. The cityscape violently contracts, then dramatically expands.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A cityscape where gravity selectively inverts, buildings ripple like water, and the robot's form fluidly melds with passing cars. UFO lights pulsate in a synchronized, impossible dance across the sky, leaving luminous trails that rewind and loop, while the street itself contorts and stretches like warm taffy, defying Euclidean geometry.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera *slowly tracks forward* through the bustling, cyberpunk city street, the *glowing Bitcoin billboards pulsing* rhythmically. A *sleek, futuristic car glides* effortlessly past, its headlights casting *long, ethereal streaks* across the wet pavement. Overhead, a *fleet of silent, glowing UFOs drifts* ominously, their undersides emitting *soft, rhythmic light pulses*. As the camera *nears a chrome-plated humanoid figure*, its head *lights subtly flicker*, before it *deliberately turns*, revealing a *piercing gaze* towards the alien armada.",
