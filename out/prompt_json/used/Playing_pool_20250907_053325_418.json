    "video_prompt": "A woman aiming a cue stick at a pool table:\n\nSubtle movements:\n- The woman's hair gently sways.\n- Her chest subtly rises and falls with breathing.\n- Very slight glint of light on the pool balls.\n- Tiny dust particles float in the air, catching the light.\n- Extremely subtle movement of the cue stick as if she's about to make a shot.\n- The bokeh lights in the background gently shift or pulse.\n- A very minor, slow zoom into the scene, almost imperceptible.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A beautiful Asian woman with dark, sleek hair, some strands falling across her face. She is leaning over a billiard table, focused on a shot. Her face is slightly angled, looking up towards the viewer, with intense, dark eyes and striking red lipstick. Her right hand is holding the cue stick, and her left hand is positioned on the table for support, guiding the cue.\n\n**Environment:** A vibrant green billiard (pool) table with several pool balls visible: an orange striped ball (number 9), a purple striped ball (number 12), a solid white cue ball, a solid blue ball (number 2), and a solid black 8-ball. The background is a dimly lit pool hall or bar, with a dark, blurred, and out-of-focus bokeh effect showing various circular light reflections (possibly from fairy lights, distant lamps, or reflections).\n\n**Composition:** Medium-shot, portrait orientation. The camera angle is dramatically tilted, almost as if looking down from above (or the subject is heavily tilted), creating a dynamic and unconventional perspective. The billiard table occupies the left side of the frame, angled sharply from upper left to lower mid-right. The woman's body and face dominate the upper right and central-right portions of the image. The cue stick extends from her hand towards the cue ball.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, directional lighting, primarily from the upper left, highlighting the woman's face, arms, and the cue ball. There are subtle specular highlights on her skin, suggesting a slight sheen or luminescence. The background is dark with pronounced, soft bokeh lights. The overall atmosphere is intimate and focused on the player.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are vibrant green (billiard table), various pool ball colors (orange, purple, white, blue, black), dark hair, fair skin, and striking red (lips). The background is characterized by deep blues, grays, and blacks, with warm, soft white and orange bokeh highlights.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, cinematic, high-detail, slightly stylized with an emphasis on bokeh and a dreamlike quality in the background. The image has a slightly artistic and moody aesthetic.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Intense concentration, focused, slightly mysterious, and elegant.\n\n**Additional details:**\n* Slight moisture or fine particles visible as small, bright dots on the woman's arm and face (suggesting sweat, water droplets, or highly rendered skin texture).\n* Sharp focus on the woman's face, hands, and the cue ball; shallow depth of field with significant background blur and foreground blur (bokeh effects).\n* The brand signature \"c29\" is subtly present in the lower right corner, indicating a digital art or photography signature.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle movements:\n- Her hair sways gently.\n- Her chest subtly rises and falls with breath.\n- A slight glint of light shifts on the pool balls.\n- Tiny dust motes drift in the air.\n- The cue stick imperceptibly shifts, anticipating a shot.\n- Background bokeh lights softly pulse and shift.\n- A barely perceptible, slow zoom into the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A woman aims a cue stick at a pool table. Suddenly, the pool balls levitate and violently spin, crackling with energy. The cue stick spontaneously ignites, spewing sparks. Her hair whips around her, unbound by gravity, as her eyes glow intensely, and the bokeh lights in the background burst into blinding flashes. The entire table begins to violently shake, the felt rippling like water.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A woman aiming a cue stick at a pool table. The pool balls, defying gravity, slowly levitate and orbit the cue stick like planets. Her hair transforms into ethereal smoke, swirling around her. The table ripples like water, reflecting an impossible sky. Bokeh lights coalesce into shimmering, sentient eyes blinking in the background, as the entire scene gently rotates upside down.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic Video Prompt:**\n\nThe camera dramatically swoops down, revealing the intense focus in her eyes. It slowly pushes in, highlighting the subtle trembling of her hand as she grips the cue. Suddenly, a single drop of sweat beads and rolls down her temple, catching the light as the background bokeh softly blurs and brightens. As she leans in, the cue stick, now a vibrant blur of motion, strikes the cue ball with an almost imperceptible *thwack*, sending the numbered balls scattering in slow motion, hinting at the force of the impact. The camera then pans across the table, following a tumbling ball into the deep, dark pocket.",
