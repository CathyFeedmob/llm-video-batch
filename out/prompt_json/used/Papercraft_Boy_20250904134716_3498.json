  "video_prompt": "A young boy with a flowing scarf moves around a miniature planet, which sprouts and shifts. Clouds drift across a soft grey sky, subtly changing shape, while small plant elements subtly sway. \n",
  "image_prompt": "Whimsical paper-cut Little Prince character with blond hair, turquoise tunic, and flowing yellow scarf, resembling a crescent moon. He stands on a beige, Saturn-like planet with textured ridges, swirling paper elements, and green fan-shaped plants. Stylized paper clouds, accordion folds, and white speckles float on a solid grey background. Layered 3D quilling/paper sculpture style with a soft, harmonious palette of grey, yellow, blue, and beige, evoking innocence and wonder.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A figure moves, their scarf flowing and billowing as they navigate. The planet beneath them continuously sprouts new formations and subtly shifts its contours. Clouds drift dynamically across the sky, their forms constantly morphing, while small plant elements subtly sway and undulate."
