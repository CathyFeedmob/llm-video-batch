    "video_prompt": "Subtle camera pan down, gentle sway of the man's coat and pants, slight flickering of distant city lights, faint glow changes of the skyscraper's apex.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot, a lone figure from behind, stands on the edge of a tall building's rooftop, looking out over a vast, futuristic cyberpunk cityscape at sunset. The figure wears a long, tattered, muted grey coat with some dark stains on the back, dark gloves, and distressed pants, bulky shoes. Their posture conveys contemplation. The city stretches into the hazy distance, filled with tightly packed, towering skyscrapers. One prominent, very tall skyscraper in the center background stands out, glowing brilliantly at its very top with an intense, fiery orange light, dominating the skyline.\n\nThe sky is a dramatic gradient of dark grey at the top, transitioning into a vibrant, fiery orange and yellow at the horizon due to the sunset. The city lights below are a mix of cool blues, turquoises, and some warmer yellows, creating streaks and dots of light throughout the urban sprawl. The overall atmosphere is moody, contemplative, and slightly ominous, yet also awe-inspiring.\n\n**Composition:** High-angle, slightly Dutch tilt looking down into the city, rule of thirds, leading lines from the cityscape.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic backlighting from the sunset, creating silhouettes and strong contrasts. Bright, glowing light sources from the central skyscraper and city lights.\n**Colors:** Dominant colors are deep oranges, fiery yellows, cool blues, turquoises, dark greys, and muted browns.\n**Style:** Cinematic, hyperrealistic, detailed, futuristic, dystopian, cyberpunk aesthetic. Hints of grunge and decay on the figure and rooftop.\n**Atmosphere:** Grand, melancholic, epic, vast, contemplative, futuristic, dramatic.\n\n**Additional details (optional but good for specific AI models):**\n* **Camera:** Ultra-wide angle lens, cinematic aspect ratio.\n* **Render:** Photorealistic render, volumetric lighting, depth of field.\n* **Techniques:** Global illumination, ray tracing.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Camera subtly pans downward. Man's coat and pants gently sway. Distant city lights faintly flicker. Skyscraper's apex exhibits subtle glow changes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Aggressive camera swoop, violent gusts rip through the man's tattered coat, pants thrash against the wind. Distant city lights erupt and dim chaotically. The skyscraper's apex flares, then pulses with an eerie, blinding light that streaks across the sky. Buildings around the city pulse and shiver, preparing for a cataclysmic transformation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The man's coat weaves into the skyscraper's apex, pulling the city sky into undulating ribbons that invert gravity. Distant lights melt into liquid constellations, flowing upward into the building's core, causing its materials to subtly ripple and transform into an ethereal fog. The man's pants unravel into a flock of luminescent birds, spiraling up and through the melting sky, each feather leaving a trail of impossible color that paints the now-upside-down cityscape.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera orbits closer to the man on the precipice, revealing bloodstains on his tattered coat as the wind whips it violently. Distant city lights pulse erratically, mimicking his rapid breathing. A micro-zoom focuses on a single tear falling just as the apex of the central skyscraper flares intensely, echoing an internal struggle.",
