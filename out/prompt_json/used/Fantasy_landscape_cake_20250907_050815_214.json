    "video_prompt": "A subtle glimmer trails the small boat as it glides on the teal water. The yellow lights flicker softly, creating a gentle glow. Cotton clouds drift slightly in the air. The tiny orange birds subtly shift their positions.",
    "image_prompt": "A top-down, slightly elevated full shot captures a whimsical, highly detailed diorama-style cake. The cake base is a vibrant pale green with undulating white icing swirls, mimicking rolling hills and paths. A central 'river' of light blue icing flows through a channel, seemingly cascading over a cut edge of the cake to create a 'waterfall' effect. Miniature details adorn the cake:\n\n**Elements & Composition:**\n*   **Central Features:** A miniature wooden sailboat with cream sails is positioned in the blue icing river. A small, realistic silver bridge with intricate railings spans the river, connecting two 'landmasses'.\n*   **Mountains/Hills:** Two prominent, conical cake elements rise from the green base. One is a rich caramel-colored 'lava' mountain with white icing 'snow' on top, suggesting a volcano. The other is a rounded, textured brown element, possibly representing a rocky hill or a tree.\n*   **Miniature Figurines:** Small gnomes are strategically placed: two on the green land, appearing to dig or work with a shovel and basket, and another two on the white rim of the cake, seemingly tending to miniature string lights.\n*   **Atmospheric Features:** Fluffy white 'clouds' float above the cake, some with small, translucent orange bird figurines perched on or near them, some of which appear lightly illuminated.\n*   **Background Elements:** In the background, a tiered structure made of light brown blocks resembles a pyramid or ancient ruins, with more clouds and orange birds scattered around.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   Warm, golden string lights are intricately woven throughout the cake, illuminating the riverbed, the base of the mountains, and outlining the cake's lower edge, creating a magical, dream-like ambiance.\n*   The overall lighting is soft and warm, with subtle highlights on the icing and miniature elements, suggesting a whimsical or enchanted indoor setting.\n\n**Style:**\n*   The style is a blend of hyperrealism for the miniature elements (gnomes, boat, bridge) and artistic interpretation for the cake's edible landscape (icing swirls, 'lava' mountain). It has a playful, artisanal, and slightly fantastical aesthetic.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Dominant colors are pale green, light blue, creamy white, various shades of brown (caramel, chocolate), and pops of translucent orange (birds) and warm yellow (lights).\n\n**Inspiration:**\n*   Think Studio Ghibli meets a meticulously crafted dessert. It evokes a sense of miniature storytelling and enchantment.\n\nGenerate a highly detailed miniature cake diorama. The cake is predominantly pale green with intricate white icing swirls resembling landscape contours. A bright light blue icing river flows through the cake, forming a realistic waterfall over a cut edge. A miniature wooden sailboat with cream sails is on the river, accompanied by a detailed silver bridge connecting two landmasses. The cake features two main conical elevations: one, a rich caramel-colored 'lava' mountain with white icing mimicking snow and flowing caramel, and the other, a textured brown mound. Small, charming gnome figurines are positioned on the cake, some tilling the green land with shovels and baskets, others tending to warm, glowing string lights that are embedded in the 'river' and along the cake's base. Fluffy white clouds, some with translucent orange bird figurines that are subtly illuminated from within, float above the cake. In the background, a tiered structure of light brown sugar cubes creates a sense of depth and additional landscape features. The lighting is soft and magical, enhancing the warm glow of the miniature lights, creating a whimsical and enchanted atmosphere. The shot is a slightly elevated full view, focusing on the meticulous detail and storytelling of this edible landscape.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle glimmer trailing boat as it glides; yellow lights softly flickering; cotton clouds gently drifting; tiny orange birds subtly shifting.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Water rips upward in a violent surge, launching the boat through a maelstrom of light. Yellow sparks flash, igniting the clouds as they violently tear apart. Orange birds shriek, transforming into fiery projectiles, striking mountains as they explode into molten syrup. The earth quakes, splitting open, revealing subterranean glows.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The boat, now made of shifting light, slices through the water, leaving a trail of reverse-growing emerald vines. Birds, formed from solidified sunlight, orbit the caramel volcanoes, their feathers rippling into shimmering mist. Clouds of spun sugar gently descend, absorbing the flickering lights, which then sprout into tiny, singing gnomes. The entire cake slowly inverts, mountains becoming valleys as the teal water pours upwards, dissolving into a cosmic swirl of color.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The subtle glimmer trailing the small boat expands into a radiant path, illuminating the teal water as the camera smoothly tracks its silent glide. Yellow lights intensely pulsate, creating a dramatic halo around the boat. Cotton clouds, now swirling ominously, gather above the vibrant mountains, while the tiny orange birds transform into a frantic swarm, their flight paths creating chaotic streaks of light, hinting at an impending, breathtaking climax.",
