    "video_prompt": "Subtle smoke rising from the fiery object, faint flickering of the interior lights, slight twitching of the creature within the scope, distant soldiers' guns emit muzzle flashes, slight swaying of the cables in the background, minor dust motes drifting in the air, and a very subtle zoom-in of the camera.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA grimdark, detailed, and highly atmospheric scene depicting a futuristic, military-grade scope viewing a monstrous, bio-mechanical sphere. The scope, central and dominant, is a large, ornate, metallic ring, heavily detailed with intricate industrial components, wires, gears, and sharp, gothic-inspired spires at its top, adorned with a golden, sun-like emblem. Splatters of dark red blood are visible on its metallic surface, suggesting recent violence.\n\nThrough the scope's circular lens, a horrifying, pulsating sphere, appearing organic and mechanical, covered in gruesome, exposed flesh, veins, and bone-like structures, is engulfed in vibrant, hellish orange flames that illuminate the interior of the scope. The sphere is positioned directly in the center of the crosshairs, which are subtle orange lines overlaid on transparent glass. Orange holographic readings and data, resembling futuristic UI elements, are scattered across the scope's view, with some characters being stylized and illegible (e.g., \"T6Y9,\" \"TRLIEN,\" \"TGT\").\n\nBelow the scope, a dark, war-torn landscape stretches out, resembling a battlefield. The ground is a desolate, reddish-brown, covered in what appears to be vast pools of blood, gore, and scattered debris. In the mid-ground, a phalanx of heavily armored futuristic soldiers, clad in dark, olive-green and black power armor with gold and grey shoulder pads, march forward. They carry long, high-tech rifles, their expressions obscured by helmets. The perspective is from behind another soldier in the foreground, whose armored back and shoulder are visible on the right, aiming a similar rifle.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is intensely dark, gritty, and oppressive, with a sense of impending doom. The lighting is dramatic, with the orange glow from the fiery sphere providing the primary light source within the scope, contrasting with the muted, desaturated light of the external environment. Smoke and mist hang heavy in the air, adding to the grim setting. The style is hyper-realistic with strong influences from Warhammer 40,000 aesthetics and grimdark science fiction. Sharp focus on the scope and foreground elements, with a slight depth of field blurring the distant soldiers.\n\n**Key elements to emphasize:**\n\n*   **Central Scope:** Ornate, metallic, gothic-industrial, blood-spattered.\n*   **Target within Scope:** Bio-mechanical, fleshy, fiery, grotesque.\n*   **Holographic UI:** Orange, futuristic, partially illegible text/symbols.\n*   **Battlefield:** Reddish-brown, blood-soaked ground, desolate.\n*   **Soldiers:** Heavily armored, grimdark, futuristic.\n*   **Color Palette:** Dominant dark greys, blacks, olive greens, rich reddish-browns, contrasting with intense orange and golden accents.\n*   **Lighting:** Dramatic, high contrast, internal fiery glow vs. external muted light.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Grimdark, oppressive, war-torn, macabre.\n*   **Perspective:** Close-up on scope, eye-level with marching soldiers.\n*   **Art Style:** Hyper-realistic, detailed, sci-fi military, Warhammer 40k inspired.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refinement:\n\nSubtle smoke wisps from the fiery object. Interior lights gently flicker. The creature within the scope exhibits slight twitching. Distant guns emit intermittent muzzle flashes. Background cables subtly sway. Minute dust motes drift. The camera very subtly zooms inward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Cataclysmic eruption from the engulfed creature, explosive muzzle flashes from charging soldiers, cables violently lash, dust storms aggressively swirl, and the scope-view violently shakes and distorts.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Ectoplasmic tendrils writhe from the fiery orb, consuming the reverse-revolving scope. A cosmic-horror creature within the lens phases through dimensions, its form dissolving into shimmering dust. Soldiers, now ethereal energy, fire rays of pure starlight, while their guns transmute into blooming flora. Gravity inverts, pulling cables skyward like serpentine constellations, as shimmering motes coalesce into miniature galaxies. The camera drifts through nebulae of pure thought, everything breathing and un-breathing.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Dramatic zoom out from the monstrous object, revealing soldiers bracing for impact. Smoke billows, obscuring parts of the grotesque form as flames intensify, casting dancing shadows. The camera swoops over the huddled soldiers as they raise their weapons, muzzle flashes briefly illuminating the grim scene, the air thick with dust and tension.",
