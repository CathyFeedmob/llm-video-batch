  "video_prompt": "A central explosion radiates outwards, bursting with sharp, metallic fragments intensely illuminated by a powerful, pulsating light. Molten gold and shimmering silver pieces reflect light, flashing iridescent purple and blue. Long, glowing shards rapidly extend radially, spreading energetic movement. Tiny glittering particles drift and sparkle in the deep black void as shifting light beams pierce the darkness, causing atmospheric haziness to fluctuate. Reflective spheres subtly shimmer, catching dynamic light.",
  "image_prompt": "Highly detailed, dynamic abstract composition featuring an explosive, radiating core of sharp, faceted metallic fragments and crystals, dominated by brilliant gold, shimmering silver/chrome, and iridescent purple/blue flashes. Set against a deep black void, with sharp, radial lines and shards extending outwards, filled with sparkling particles and piercing light beams. In the foreground, reflective silver and gold spheres and dark metallic structures. High-energy, deconstructed futuristic landscape with dramatic lighting, extreme depth, and intricate reflections.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "An outward-radiating explosion propels metallic fragments, bursting and spreading dynamically. A powerful, pulsating light illuminates the scene, causing molten gold and silver pieces to flash iridescent purple and blue as they move and reflect. Long, glowing shards rapidly extend radially, spreading energetic movement. Tiny glittering particles drift and sparkle while shifting light beams pierce the darkness, making atmospheric haziness fluctuate. Reflective spheres subtly shimmer, catching the dynamic illumination."
