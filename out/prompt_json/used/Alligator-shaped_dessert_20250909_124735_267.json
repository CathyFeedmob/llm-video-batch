    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nClose-up of a whimsical, cute crocodile-shaped dessert, sculpted from light green cake or mousse with a velvety, slightly textured surface, resembling a flocked toy. The crocodile has large, innocent brown eyes with white highlights, a gently smiling mouth revealing small, pointed white teeth with a hint of dark brown outlining, and distinct brow ridges. Its tail curls gracefully, and its back features several small, pointed, lighter green scales. The dessert rests on a pristine white rectangular platter or serving dish, reflecting its shape subtly. The background is a soft, diffused olive-green, creating an ethereal and gentle atmosphere, with subtle, out-of-focus darker green shapes, possibly leaves, hinting at natural elements. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the dessert's texture and creating gentle shadows that give it depth. The overall aesthetic is clean, inviting, and playful.\n\n**Breakdown of elements and reasoning:**\n\n*   **Subject:** \"whimsical, cute crocodile-shaped dessert\" - Clearly identifies the main subject and its character.\n*   **Material/Texture:** \"light green cake or mousse with a velvety, slightly textured surface, resembling a flocked toy\" - Describes the color, texture, and provides a useful analogy for the surface quality.\n*   **Key Features (Crocodile):**\n    *   \"large, innocent brown eyes with white highlights\" - Specifies eye color, expression, and detail.\n    *   \"gently smiling mouth revealing small, pointed white teeth with a hint of dark brown outlining\" - Details the mouth shape, teeth, and a subtle outlining for definition.\n    *   \"distinct brow ridges\" - Adds another specific facial feature.\n    *   \"tail curls gracefully\" - Describes the pose of the tail.\n    *   \"back features several small, pointed, lighter green scales\" - Specifies the detail on the back and its color relative to the body.\n*   **Placement/Props:** \"rests on a pristine white rectangular platter or serving dish, reflecting its shape subtly\" - Defines the base and mentions its reflective quality.\n*   **Background:** \"soft, diffused olive-green, creating an ethereal and gentle atmosphere, with subtle, out-of-focus darker green shapes, possibly leaves, hinting at natural elements\" - Describes the main background color, its blurriness, the atmosphere it creates, and hints at the blurry forms in the background.\n*   **Lighting:** \"soft and even, highlighting the dessert's texture and creating gentle shadows that give it depth\" - Defines the light quality and its effect on the subject.\n*   **Composition:** \"Close-up\" - Specifies the framing. Implicitly, the crocodile faces slightly left, positioned centrally on the platter.\n*   **Atmosphere/Style:** \"The overall aesthetic is clean, inviting, and playful.\" - Summarizes the desired mood and style.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A terrifying shimmer on the cake surface bursts into a violent explosion! The alligator lunges, its eyes burning, fangs snapping. The table cracks and splinters, sending debris flying. The background swirls into an ominous vortex, pulled by an unseen force. Pure pandemonium erupts as the static world is torn asunder!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A gentle shimmer on the cake surface, almost like scales subtly reflecting light. As light hits the alligator cake, iridescent scales ripple and detach, floating upwards like bioluminescent motes in reverse gravity. The cake's form elongates, teeth retracting into smiles, as it playfully dances on the plate, shimmering green hues bleeding into the white surface, morphing the plate into a swirling cosmic pond.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic reveal focuses on a vibrant green alligator cake. A slow, dramatic track-in reveals the gentle shimmer on its surface, almost like scales subtly reflecting light. As the camera glides closer, a hand enters the frame, delicately touching the textured \"skin\" before slowly trailing along its back, emphasizing the intricate details. Soft, dappled light shifts across the cake, enhancing its whimsical allure.",
