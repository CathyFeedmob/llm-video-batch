    "video_prompt": "The shimmering petals subtly undulate, catching glints of light that dance across their surface. The translucent white and blue ribbons in the background gently drift and swirl, accompanied by faint, sparkling particle effects that float and dissipate.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nVibrant, glossy relief sculpture of a stylized peony in full bloom, rendered in a translucent and iridescent material, resembling layered stained glass or polished resin. The petals are a gradient of soft pastel colors: light yellow at the center, transitioning to pink, light purple, and cerulean blue towards the outer edges. Each petal is outlined with a thin, embossed gold rim, catching the light. The flower's center features short, textured green filaments. A graceful, light green stem with several leaves, also outlined in gold, extends downwards and to the right. The leaves are textured with tones of light green and teal/turquoise. The background is a clean, bright white or light grey, creating a sense of depth for the raised flower. Light reflections shimmer across the glossy petals and leaves, indicating a strong, possibly top-down or soft diffused light source, creating subtle shadows that enhance the 3D relief effect. There are delicate, ethereal, swirling light trails or wisps in pale blue and white emanating from behind the flower and stem, adding to a magical or enchanting atmosphere. Small, sparkling light flares or starbursts are sparsely scattered, particularly around the swirling light elements and in the lower right corner, where a golden \"c29\" and a teal stylized symbol are subtly placed. The overall aesthetic is elegant, ethereal, and radiant, with a strong emphasis on texture, color gradients, and luminosity. **No text, numbers, or watermarks other than what is described and visible in the image (the \"c29\" graphic).**",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Petals subtly undulate, catching dancing light glints. Translucent ribbons gently drift and swirl, accompanied by floating, dissipating sparkling particle effects.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Petals erupt, violently ripping from the flower, each fragment glittering as it hurtles through the air. The ribbons twist into a chaotic vortex, consuming surrounding light. Stars burst from the background, colliding with the disintegrating petals in a blinding shower of sparks. The entire scene pulsates with aggressive, explosive energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The luminous petals subtly undulate, their iridescence **absorbing light to become briefly invisible**, then reappearing with **inverted colors**. The translucent ribbons, composed of liquid starlight, **coalesce into sentient tendrils**, gracefully **pulling the entire flower through impossible spatial folds**. Faint, sparkling particles defy gravity, transforming into **miniature nebulae that birth and consume themselves**, their light echoing through **non-Euclidean dimensions**.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in begins on a single, shimmering petal, its translucent surface catching a sudden, intense glint of light. The camera then sweeps downward, following a swirling, ethereal blue ribbon that billows across the frame, revealing more of the iridescent floral design. As the camera pulls back, tiny, sparkling particles burst into existence around the entire flower, spiraling upwards and disappearing, leaving the magnificent bloom bathed in a soft, heavenly glow.",
