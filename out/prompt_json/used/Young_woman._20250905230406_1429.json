  "image_prompt": "Generate a portrait of an East Asian woman on a polaroid, medium shot, against a black background with a white border. She is slightly left of center, facing left, with her head and upper torso visible. Her dark hair frames her face and drapes over her left shoulder. She has fair skin, a small nose, and full lips; her visible light-brown right eye looks straight ahead. Strong light illuminates the right side of her face, leaving the left in shadow. The image has a warm orange and brown palette with prominent glitch effects in blue, purple, and green, especially in the bottom right corner distorting her shoulder and background, and also in the upper right. The dark background faintly suggests a reflective surface. Include a small white \"AI \u751f\u6210\" box in the top-left background. Hand-written \"C29\" text appears in the bottom right of the image and on the polaroid's white border. The polaroid frame should show slight imperfections.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Woman's gaze shifts, revealing evolving subtle emotion. Vibrant glitch effects ripple and distort around her. The background dynamically shifts, with reflections fluidly altering. The polaroid frame subtly warps, then smoothly resolves its form. Text animates onto the frame, then gently dissolves."
