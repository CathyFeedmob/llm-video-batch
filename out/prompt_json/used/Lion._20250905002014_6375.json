  "image_prompt": " Vibrant, detailed, painterly portrait of a lion's head, three-quarter profile facing right, against a solid red background. The lion features warm golden, orange, and brown tones with striking cool blue, turquoise, and purple accents in its fur and mane. Expressive, flowing brushstrokes depict the lush mane. Golden-orange, alert eyes. Bold fuchsia/magenta swatches across the snout. Dark, shiny nose with pink-red nostrils and white whiskers. Lighter, textured fur around the muzzle. Visible brushstrokes in a rich, matte red background. Modern, abstract, majestic.",
