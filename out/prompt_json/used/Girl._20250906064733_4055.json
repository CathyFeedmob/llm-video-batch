  "video_prompt": "A girl brings an ice pop to her mouth, legs dangling over rippling water. The vibrant, painterly environment around her shifts, revealing overgrown ruins and glowing foliage.",
  "image_prompt": "**Highly stylized, vibrant digital painting of a solitary young girl in a simple sundress, sitting on an overgrown, mossy brick ledge. She contemplates an ice pop. The background is a fantastical, overgrown ruin with abstract, architectural shapes, dominated by painterly teal, turquoise, and yellow-green hues, with watercolor-like textures and reflections in water below.**",

  "refined_video_prompt": "The girl's arm fluidly lifts the ice pop, her expression shifting from anticipation to subtle delight. Her legs gently swing, causing the water beneath to softly ripple. The vibrant, painterly environment dynamically transforms, morphing to reveal ancient, overgrown ruins emerging and receding, while foliage begins to softly glow and pulse with light."
