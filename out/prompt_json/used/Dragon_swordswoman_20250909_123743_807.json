    "video_prompt": "The woman's hair subtly sways and her red hair tie ripples slightly. Her eyes softly blink, and the red embellishments on her earrings gently dangle. The faint glowing blue light around the katana hilt pulses softly. In the background, the large dragon moves with subtle, slow undulations, and its red eyes glow and dim. Scattered red flower petals in the foreground softly drift downwards. A gentle breath of wind rustles the fabrics of the woman's clothing.",
    "image_prompt": "A beautifully rendered digital painting of a fierce female warrior, medium-shot portrait, looking back over her shoulder, in a detailed East Asian fantasy setting with a prominent dragon.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Character:** A young East Asian female warrior, fair skin, slender build. Black hair tied into a messy bun at the crown with red ties and ornaments, wisps of hair framing her face. Delicate features, large expressive grey-green eyes, full lips with a subtle pink tint. Red choker necklace, and ornate gold and red dangling earrings. A prominent, detailed blue dragon tattoo covers her entire left shoulder and upper arm.

Her left arm has a dark brown fabric wrist wrap, and her right forearm has a black and red wrap with some metallic elements.\n*   **Weapons:** A katana (Japanese sword) is prominently featured, with its scabbard hanging from her belt. The blade is partially visible, emanating a subtle blue glow or energy.\n*   **Dragon:** A massive, dark grey-blue dragon with red glowing eyes arches behind her, its body snaking through the background. Its scales are detailed, and its presence is imposing.\n*   **Environment:** Ruined stone structures (possibly temple ruins or ancient stairs) frame the scene on either side, with overgrown parts adorned with vibrant red cherry blossom-like flowers. The ground is made of large, weathered stone steps.\n*   **Atmosphere:** A mystical, serene yet powerful atmosphere.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The warrior's face is positioned roughly around the upper-left intersection, drawing immediate attention.\n*   **Leading Lines:** The subtle curve of the dragon's body and the lines of the stone steps likely contribute to guiding the viewer's eye.\n*   **Depth:** The dragon and distant mountains provide depth to the background, while the warrior and sword are in the immediate foreground.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Tones:** Cool tones of blues, greys, and blacks dominate (sky, dragon, stones, clothing).\n*   **Accents:** Striking warm accents of red (flowers, warrior's accessories, dragon eyes) provide contrast and visual interest.\n*   **Subtle Glow:** The blue glow from the sword and the red glow from the dragon's eyes add an ethereal quality.\n*   **Skin Tones:** Soft, natural skin tones.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Ambient Light:** Soft, diffused twilight or pre-dawn light, casting a gentle blue-purple hue over the scene.\n*   **Directional Light:** Subtle illumination from the visible part of the sky, highlighting the warrior's skin and the dragon's form.\n*   **Emissive Light:** The glowing sword and dragon eyes are sources of light within the image.\n\n**Art Style:**\n*   **Digital Painting/Illustration:** Highly rendered with smooth blending, sharp details, and a painterly texture in some areas.\n*   **Fantasy/Anime Inspired:** Elements of East Asian fantasy and character design often found in high-quality anime or video game art.\n*   **Realistic yet Stylized:** The character and dragon have realistic proportions and details but with a distinct stylized artistic flair.\n\n**Overall Tone:** Epic, serene, mysterious, powerful.\n\n**Full Prompt:**\n\"A highly detailed digital painting of a beautiful and fierce East Asian female warrior from a fantasy setting, medium shot, looking back over her left shoulder towards the viewer. She has black hair styled in a messy bun with red ties, delicate features, large grey-green eyes, and subtle makeup. A prominent blue dragon tattoo adorns her left shoulder and arm. She wears a white bandeau top revealing her back and a long, flowing dark hakama with a red rope belt. A katana, its blade emitting a soft blue glow, hangs from her hip. Behind her, a massive dark grey-blue dragon with glowing red eyes arches across the sky. The scene is set amidst ancient, moss-covered stone ruins and steps, with vibrant red cherry blossoms on trailing branches. The lighting is soft twilight, casting cool blue and purple hues, with warm red accents providing strong contrast. The art style is a blend of realistic detail and stylized fantasy illustration, evocative of high-quality anime or game art. Epic, serene, mysterious atmosphere. Intricate details, cinematic composition.\"",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The woman's hair whips violently, her red tie snaps taut. Her eyes flash open, furious, as her earrings swing wildly. The katana hilt erupts with blinding blue energy. In the background, the colossal dragon thrashes, its scales shattering the ground as its red eyes blaze, then erupt into fiery streams. Torrential winds send a vortex of red petals swirling upwards. The woman's clothing tears as if caught in a sudden explosion of force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The woman's hair unravels into a cascade of bioluminescent threads, forming new geometric shapes before reforming. Her red hair tie morphs into a constellation, then re-solidifies. Her eyes become swirling galaxies, blinking in time with the dragon's red eyes which expand into miniature suns, then contract. The katana hilt's blue light transforms into water, flowing upwards into the sky. The dragon's body shatters into a swarm of red petals that rain upwards, each petal twisting into a new miniature dragon, then dissolving. The woman's clothing ripples with impossible iridescent colors.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic low-angle shot pushes in as the woman's hair and red tie sway. Her eyes slowly blink, with the glowing katana hilt pulsing brighter. The camera sweeps to reveal the massive dragonâ€™s head, its red eyes flaring fiercely before dimming. As the woman's clothing rustles, a sudden gust kicks up a swirl of red petals, momentarily obscuring her, only to reveal her with a more intense gaze and a subtle readiness to draw the blade.",
