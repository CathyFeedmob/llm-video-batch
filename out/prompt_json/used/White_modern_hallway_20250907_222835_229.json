    "video_prompt": "Subtle camera very slow zoom in, gentle light shifts creating creeping shadows along the floor and walls, a very subtle flicker of light on the reflective floor.",
    "image_prompt": "A minimalist, clean, and futuristic long hallway, symmetrical in design, with a strong sense of depth and perspective leading to a dark grey wall at the very end. The walls are a pristine white, catching bright sunlight from the right, casting long, sharp shadows of equally spaced pillars along the left side. The highly reflective white floor intensifies the bright light and reflections, creating bright vertical streaks that mirror the pillars. The overall ambiance is serene and architectural, with a focus on light and shadow play. The signature \"c29\" is subtly placed in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera crawl zoom, creeping shadows from gentle light shifts on floor and walls, a very subtle reflective shimmer across the floor.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent jolts, the pristine corridor contorts and twists as light explodes, ripping through the very fabric of the passage. Pillars tear free, thrashing against the crushing force, while the floor shatters into a liquid vortex, sucking shadows into nothingness. The distant end collapses inward, a blinding implosion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A very slow zoom into an infinitely repeating hallway, gentle light shifts causing shadows to writhe and dissolve into light, reflective floor melting into a liquid sky mirroring inverted architecture, walls subtly pulse and breathe, defying gravity as surfaces curve and distort, pillars dematerializing into ethereal wisps, the floor becomes a rippling portal to other dimensions, with soft light from an unseen source washing over all, warping perception.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A ghostly, slow-motion push-in reveals the endless corridor, sunlight intensifying as the camera glides across the polished floor, casting long, dramatic shadows that stretch and dance like phantom figures on the walls. The \"c29\" subtly shimmers on the floor as if pulled into the reflection. As the camera very slowly drifts back, the entire light and shadows begin to pulsate with subtle, unsettling rhythm.",
