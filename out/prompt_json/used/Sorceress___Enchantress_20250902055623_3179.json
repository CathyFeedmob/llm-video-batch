  "video_prompt": "A sorceress, her dark hair gently flowing, intensely channels electric blue magic. Her glowing eyes pulse as she actively manipulates two luminous rods, generating intricate symbols that pulse with power. From her right symbol, a dynamic stream of ethereal blue energy dramatically descends and coils on the floor, pooling into a pulsating, glowing magic circle. Blue light emanates from a grand arched window, while twinkling stars and crescent moons float and drift in the gothic hall. Subtle shifts in light and shadow define the scene.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Keyword-Rich):**\n\"A mystical sorceress performs a magical ritual in a grand gothic hall. Tall, slender woman with long dark flowing hair, pale skin, and glowing electric blue eyes.

She manipulates glowing blue magic rods, each ending in complex runic symbols (star, pentagram, crescent moon). Ethereal blue energy streams from her hand, coiling into a glowing runic magic circle on the floor. Grand gothic architecture, soaring arches, imposing columns, a massive arched window emitting blue light from a moonlit sky. Floating blue stars and crescent moons are scattered. Dark, tangled skeletal remains in the foreground. **Dominant deep blue, silver, ethereal white color palette.
