    "video_prompt": "Subtle sand particles drift on the ground and kick up around the tires. The UN logo on the motorcycle's front subtly flickers. The woman's hair gently sways in an unseen breeze. Overhead, the distant nebula pulsates with a soft, ethereal glow.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\nA futuristic female motorcyclist in a desert landscape. She is wearing a white, red, and blue jumpsuit with integrated white and red armored plating on her shoulders, forearms, knees, and shins. She has a white helmet with red and blue accents, a clear visor, and subtle tech details on the sides. A rifle is strapped to her back, visible above her left shoulder. She is seated on a white, red, and blue futuristic motorcycle with exposed blue and red hoses/cables, bright blue LED headlights, and large red-rimmed wheels with thick tires. The motorcycle is slightly worn, with paint chipping and dirt. The scene is set in a vast, arid desert with rolling sand dunes and scattered rocks.\n\n**Style:**\nAnime/manga inspired digital art, crisp lines, clean shading with defined highlights, slightly exaggerated technological details, and a clean overall aesthetic despite the grittiness of the desert and worn elements. The character style is sleek and athletic, typical of sci-fi action heroines. The rendering has a slight cell-shaded influence.\n\n**Composition:**\nFull-body shot of the character and motorcycle, slightly from a low-angle looking up, emphasizing the scale of the motorcycle and the commanding presence of the rider. The character is positioned slightly off-center to the left, looking towards the right side of the frame, with her body angled towards the viewer. The background features distant sand dunes receding into the horizon, creating depth. An abstract blue energy swirl or light trail is visible in the upper right sky.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are white, red, and blue for the character's attire and motorcycle, contrasting with the warm, muted tones of the desert (sandy yellow, light brown, beige for dunes; grays and darker browns for rocks). The sky is a clear, bright blue. Bright blue glowing accents on the motorcycle's headlights and the abstract sky element. Black for the motorcycle tires and some undershading.\n\n**Lighting:**\nBright, clear, and uniform daytime lighting, suggesting a strong sun. Subtle highlights on metallic and armored surfaces. There are soft shadows under the motorcycle and character, indicating the sun is high in the sky. The lighting creates a slightly dusty or hazy atmosphere in the distance.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nAdventurous, futuristic, determined, and slightly desolate. Conveys a sense of exploration or patrol in a harsh, remote environment. The futuristic elements contrast with the natural ruggedness of the desert.\n\n**Prompt Example (concise but descriptive):**\n\n\"Anime style digital art, full body shot of a futuristic female motorcyclist in a vast desert. She wears a white, red, and blue armored jumpsuit and helmet, seated on a rugged white and red sci-fi dirtbike with blue glowing headlights and exposed blue hoses. Rifle strapped to her back. Clear blue sky with a subtle energy trail. Rolling sand dunes and scattered rocks in the background. Bright daytime lighting, adventurous and determined atmosphere. Clean lines, detailed textures, slightly worn surfaces.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Flickering UN logo, subtle sand swirling around tires, woman's hair swaying gently. Distant nebula softly pulsates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sand violently whips into a blinding storm, engulfing the motorcycle. The UN logo explodes with blinding light. The woman's hair transforms into writhing serpents, snapping at the air. The distant nebula shatters, celestial shards raining down, igniting the desert into a blazing inferno. The motorcycle roars, tires spinning erratically, kicking up monstrous geysers of sand as it lunges.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The desert sands ripple like water, sand particles forming ethereal beings that dance around the tires and then *un-form*. The UN logo on the motorcycle's front warps into a shifting constellation. The woman's hair unravels into translucent ribbons that trail upwards, weaving into the pulsing nebula which *descends* into the sky, pulling the entire landscape into itself. The motorcycle's parts dissolve and reform into shimmering, non-Euclidean shapes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Extreme wide shot of the desert with a subtle sandstorm. Zoom in from the distant nebula, revealing it pulsing. Pan down to the woman, helmet visor reflecting the glow. Her hair sways as she revs the UN-marked bike, sand particles dramatically swirling around tires. The UN logo flickers intensely as she launches forward, the camera following in a sweeping motion, emphasizing the raw power and motion.",
