    "video_prompt": "Subtle light rays shimmer from the distant sun. A gentle shimmer ripples across the building's surface. Wisps of amorphous energy subtly shift and undulate around its base.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, surreal cityscape, depicted from a low-angle perspective, looking up a long, grand staircase or pathway towards an enormous, towering structure reminiscent of a futuristic, ornate building or temple that extends into the heavens. The building is designed with multiple tiers and windows, glowing with an internal light. At the very top, a brilliant, glowing white sphere or sun-like object radiates light and energy, with geometric rays or beams extending outwards into the dark sky. The entire scene is bathed in a striking color palette of deep blues, luminous purples, electric pinks, and bright cyans, giving it a dreamy, otherworldly, and highly stylized appearance. The ground leading to the structure is a wide pathway with intricate patterns, suggesting depth and leading lines that draw the eye upwards. In the foreground, a silhouetted figure, an individual, stands small at the bottom of the pathway, facing the imposing structure, emphasizing the grand scale and the sense of awe or journey. The overall style is reminiscent of digital art or a highly saturated illustration, with fluid, almost painterly strokes, and a strong sense of atmospheric perspective. The lighting is dramatic, with the light source at the top casting a powerful, almost spiritual glow over the entire scene.\n\n**Detailed Prompt:**\n\n**Visual Elements:** Surreal cityscape, towering ornate futuristic temple/building, grand staircase/pathway, glowing internal windows, colossal radiant sun/sphere at apex, silhouetted lone figure in foreground facing structure, abstract glowing patterns on ground.\n\n**Style:** Dreamlike, otherworldly, highly stylized digital illustration, painterly, abstract forms, fluid strokes, glowing light effects.\n\n**Composition:** Low-angle shot, strong leading lines drawing eye skyward, central dominant structure, symmetrical balance along vertical axis, small figure for scale.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant deep blues, luminous purples, electric pinks, bright cyans. Accents of stark white and black (for silhouette). High saturation.\n\n**Lighting:** Dramatic, emanating primarily from the top-center sun/sphere, casting a brilliant, ethereal glow downwards. Strong backlighting on the main structure. Subtle internal light from building windows.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Awe-inspiring, mysterious, fantastical, spiritual, sense of journey or ascent.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle light rays shimmer from the distant sun, dancing across the building's surface with a gentle ripple. Wisps of amorphous energy subtly shift and undulate around its base, demonstrating a barely perceptible, ethereal motion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sun explodes, unleashing torrents of searing light! The building rips apart, shards of glass and metal violently swirling amidst an inferno. Energy bolts lash out, tearing through space. Tentacles of dark matter writhe and coil, consuming everything in their path. The ground shatters, revealing a vortex of pure chaos. This is not just a building; it's a cosmic maelstrom, a furious dance of destruction!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A colossal, crystalline skyscraper shimmers, its geometry perpetually reconfiguring. Below, a silhouette dissolves and reforms, steps echoing backward through impossible angles. The sun pulses like a living heart, its light solidifying into tendrils that lift fragments of the building into a swirling, cosmic ballet. Amorphous energy writhing at the base morphs into spectral hands, beckoning the edifice into a shimmering, kaleidoscopic oblivion.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically tracks back, revealing an immense, luminescent city reaching towards a colossal, shimmering sun, its light pulsing. The camera ascends rapidly, a celestial zoom-out to where a lone figure—unseen, but implied by the scale—stands before the radiant edifice. Subtle energy shimmers and undulates, hinting at a powerful, unseen force, as the camera slowly rotates around to reveal the true scale of this impossible structure.",
