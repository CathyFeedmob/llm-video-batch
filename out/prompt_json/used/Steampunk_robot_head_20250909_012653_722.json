    "video_prompt": "Subtle orange light flicker within the transparent visor, gears slowly rotate, slight camera zoom in and out.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, intricate close-up portrait of a futuristic robotic bust with an anthropomorphic head, angled slightly to the right, against a dark, minimalistic background. The robot's casing is predominantly sleek, glossy black, accented with numerous polished gold mechanical components, gears, wires, and pipes that are exposed and interwoven, creating a complex steampunk-meets-cyberpunk aesthetic. The robot's face is characterized by a transparent, amber-orange visor that reveals glowing internal mechanical structures, including visible gears and circuitry, suggesting its functional \"eye\" or display.\n\nThe lighting is dramatic, with highlights catching the glossy surfaces of the black casing and the metallic sheen of the gold components, creating a strong contrast and depth. The overall atmosphere is sophisticated and technological. The composition is a medium close-up, focusing on the upper torso and head, allowing for a detailed examination of the intricate mechanics.\n\n**Key elements to include:**\n* **Subject:** Robotic bust, anthropomorphic head.\n* **Style:** Futuristic, cyberpunk, steampunk, highly detailed, intricate mechanics.\n* **Materials:** Glossy black metallic casing, polished gold gears, wires, pipes.\n* **Head feature:** Transparent amber-orange visor revealing glowing internal mechanics (gears, circuitry).\n* **Composition:** Medium close-up, head angled slightly right.\n* **Lighting:** Dramatic, high contrast, strong highlights on glossy and metallic surfaces.\n* **Background:** Dark, minimalist, out of focus.\n* **Atmosphere:** Technological, sophisticated.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few refined options, focusing exclusively on dynamic elements:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on Light/Gears):**\n> Orange light within the visor subtly flickers and dances. Gears slowly begin to rotate within the mechanism. The camera subtly zooms in and out.\n\n**Option 2 (Emphasizing Change):**\n> A gentle ripple of orange light passes across the visor. Gears within the andamento subtly shift and turn. The camera fluidly glides in and out.\n\n**Option 3 (More Evocative Movement):**\n> Pulsing orange light shimmers within the visor. Internal gears grind and slowly engage. The viewpoint subtly expands and contracts.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Visor flashes violently, gears grind furiously, cables whip and coil with explosive force. Torso plates fracture and shift, revealing sparking internal mechanisms. Head snaps, then rotates erratically, emitting blinding bursts of orange light. The entire robot shudders, limbs lurching as if possessed, metallic joints screaming under invisible strain. Rapid, disorienting camera cuts, extreme zoom-ins and whip pans emphasize the chaotic transformation.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The robot's metallic body shimmers, then ripples, as gears inside its visor spontaneously rearrange into cosmic constellations. Time warps, making the machine rapidly age and de-age, its parts briefly becoming water, then light. As gravity reverses, the robot ascends slowly, then rapidly, its reflection in the floor becoming a portal to another dimension.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic Prompt:**\n\nA slow, dramatic zoom-in reveals the robot's head. As the camera sweeps past intricate gold and black components, subtle orange light flickers behind the transparent visor, revealing gears slowly rotating within. The camera then smoothly dollies sideways, circling the robot's torso, highlighting its gleaming, mechanical complexity, before a final, tight push-in on the illuminated visor, intensifying the mysterious internal movement.",
