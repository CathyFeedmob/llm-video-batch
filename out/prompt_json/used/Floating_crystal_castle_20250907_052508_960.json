    "video_prompt": "A gentle shimmer radiates from the crystal spires of the castle, with subtle glints of light dancing across their surfaces. The rainbow mist at the base of the floating island softly undulates, and individual strands of light cascading downward from the island subtly sway and pulse in intensity, creating a soft, ethereal flow. Occasionally, faint, shimmering sparkles drift upwards from the clouds below towards the island. The clouds themselves slowly drift and morph, and a soft, gradual transition shifts the sky's colors between the warm hues on the left and the cooler tones on the right.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, fantastical vertical shot of a floating island in the sky, serving as the foundation for a vibrant crystal castle.\n\n**Visual Elements & Style:**\nThe castle is intricately designed with numerous towering, sharp crystal spires and turrets, each glowing with an iridescent, rainbow-like brilliance. The crystals exhibit a metallic and reflective quality, transitioning smoothly between colors like pink, purple, blue, green, yellow, and orange. The island itself has a rugged, rocky underside from which long, colorful crystal formations or energy streams dangle, extending downwards into the clouds. The upper surface of the island is lush with subtle greenery and has a shimmering, rainbow-colored liquid flowing or reflecting across parts of it, especially around the base of the castle. The overall style is dreamlike, magical, and ethereal, leaning towards fantasy illustration or concept art but with a photorealistic edge.\n\n**Composition:**\nThe floating island and castle are centrally placed, dominating the midground. The composition is vertical, emphasizing the height of the island above the clouds and the length of the crystal formations hanging beneath it. The sky occupies the top and bottom portions of the image, framing the central subject.\n\n**Colors:**\nThe color palette is incredibly rich and vibrant, dominated by a spectrum of rainbow colors (pink, purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red) evident in the crystals, the flowing liquid on the island, and the dangling elements.\n*   **Sky:** The sky transitions from warm hues (pinks, oranges, yellows) at the top, suggesting sunrise or sunset, to cooler, softer purples and blues towards the bottom, where dense, fluffy clouds reside.\n*   **Clouds:** The clouds are soft, billowy, and semi-transparent, allowing for a hazy and atmospheric background. They range from creamy whites and light yellows to soft purples and blues.\n*   **Crystals:** The castle crystals are intensely saturated, shifting through the full rainbow spectrum.\n*   **Rainbow Effect:** A strong rainbow effect is present wherever light interacts with the castle and the island's surface, creating shimmering reflections.\n\n**Lighting:**\nThe lighting is dramatic and magical. The castle and island actively glow from within, emanating their own light that illuminates the surrounding sky and clouds. There's also an implied external light source (sun) contributing to the warm hues at the top of the sky, creating subtle shadows and highlights on the clouds. The dangling crystal elements brightly refract and reflect light, creating streaks of color.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nThe atmosphere is majestic, wondrous, and serene. It evokes a sense of awe and fantasy, like a mythical kingdom floating in the heavens. The subtle stars visible in the sky add to the celestial and magical feeling.\n\n**Prompt Keywords:**\nFloating island, crystal castle, rainbow, iridescent, glowing, ethereal, majestic, fantasy, dreamlike, sky, clouds, sunrise/sunset colors, vibrant, colorful, towering spires, intricate, concept art, photorealistic, magical light, vertical shot, ornate, heavenly kingdom.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The castle's crystal spires gently shimmer, with dancing light glints. The rainbow mist undulates, and light strands softly sway and pulse below the island. Faint, shimmering sparkles drift upwards from the slowly morphing clouds. The sky's colors gradually shift from warm to cool.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Crystal spires on the castle violently erupt with blinding, strobing light. The rainbow mist at the island's base churns, spitting liquid fire. Downward light strands whip and crackle with aggressive lightning, slamming into the clouds below. Massive, shimmering sparkles violently burst from the clouds, rocketing skyward. Clouds themselves tear and reform in chaotic fury, the sky's colors pulsating wildly between extremes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The crystalline spires of the floating castle bend and stretch, melting into liquid rainbows that cascade upwards into the sky. Beams of light, detached from their source, phase through solid clouds as the island itself slowly inverts, pulling streams of color upwards from the misty depths. Celestial bodies, like shimmering dust, orbit the scene in impossible trajectories, appearing and disappearing at will.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic drone shot slowly circles the shimmering, crystal-spire castle on its floating island. As the camera dips below the island, rainbow light streams pulsate and individually sway, their intensity subtly shifting, creating an ethereal flow. Faint, sparkling motes drift gracefully from drifting clouds below. The sky's warm hues gradient to cool tones, amplifying the magical, gentle shimmer.",
