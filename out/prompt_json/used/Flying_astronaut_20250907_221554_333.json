    "video_prompt": "The boy's mouth slightly opens and closes as if gasping. Small dust motes drift casually through the air around him. The glow emanates from the jetpack and light device, subtly pulsating and expanding outwards. Bubbles drift and sway gently, distorting what is behind them. The drones' propellers subtly oscillate, creating slight blur. The city lights flicker and shift in intensity, with occasional glints. The bright column of light under the boy's feet and the circular platform pulses like a dynamic energy field. The camera subtly zooms in and out, and the whole scene subtly sways.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull-shot cartoon style illustration of a startled young man in a white futuristic astronaut suit with a clear bubble helmet and a black rocket pack, intensely glowing with blue energy, hovering and propelled upwards by a beam of blue light from a circular glowing platform below. He is looking forward with wide eyes and an open mouth. The composition is a dynamic mid-air scene in a futuristic city at dusk or night, surrounded by tall buildings adorned with bright, colorful neon signs and screens displaying abstract patterns and symbols. Several stylized, brightly colored drones (blue, white, purple, yellow, green) with glowing elements fly around him at various distances, some with spinning propellers. Large, iridescent, semi-transparent bubbles float throughout the scene, reflecting the city lights. The sky is dark blue and purple, filled with subtle light streaks, resembling a futuristic, slightly abstract urban landscape. The overall mood is exciting and slightly chaotic. The lighting is strong and vibrant, emanating from the glowing suit, rocket pack, platform, and city lights, creating strong contrasts and reflections on the bubbles and buildings. The color palette is dominated by blues, purples, and pinks, accented by bright neon colors of the signs and drones. A subtle motion blur effect suggests movement. The text \"c29\" is prominently displayed in the bottom right corner in white with a blue outline.\n\n**Breakdown of elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Young man, startled expression, futuristic astronaut suit (white, black accents, clear bubble helmet), rocket pack (black, glowing blue propulsion).\n*   **Action:** Hovering/flying upwards, propelled by a blue light beam from a platform.\n*   **Setting:** Futuristic city, dusk/night, tall buildings, neon signs/screens (abstract patterns, symbols), large iridescent bubbles.\n*   **Props:** Multiple stylized drones (various colors: blue, white, purple, yellow, green, all with glowing elements and spinning propellers), circular glowing platform (blue light beam).\n*   **Style:** Cartoon illustration, dynamic, energetic, slightly abstract.\n*   **Composition:** Full shot, dynamic mid-air scene, vertical emphasis, varying depths with elements closer and further away.\n*   **Colors:** Dominant blues, purples, pinks; bright neon accents (signs, drones); white/black for the suit.\n*   **Lighting:** Vibrant, strong, emanating from suit, rocket pack, platform, and city lights; strong contrasts, reflections on bubbles and buildings.\n*   **Atmosphere/Mood:** Exciting, slightly chaotic, futuristic, magical.\n*   **Effects:** Blue light beams, glowing elements, iridescent bubbles, subtle motion blur.\n*   **Text:** \"c29\" in white with a blue outline, bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The boy's mouth subtly opens and closes, as if gasping. Small dust motes drift casually. The jetpack and light device glow, subtly pulsating and expanding. Bubbles drift and sway, distorting backgrounds. Drone propellers subtly oscillate, blurring. City lights flicker and shift, with occasional glints. The light column and platform pulse like an energy field. The camera subtly zooms and the scene sways.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The boy's mouth violently contorts in a scream, his suit jetpack erupting with explosive bursts. Dust motes violently swirl, coalescing into chaotic vortexes. Bubbles burst with unexpected force, sending shimmering shards flying. Drones suddenly dart and collide, propellers spinning into dazzling blurs. City lights flash and strobe erratically, buildings sway precariously, and the energy platform thrashes with raw power. The camera lunges and dives, mirroring the scene's electrifying chaos.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The boy's gasping mouth distorts into a helix, pulling nearby bubbles into iridescent, swirling portals. Drones phase through the city buildings, leaving trails of inverted colors. Dust motes condense into vibrant, shifting constellations. The jetpack's glow ripples outwards, transmuting the urban landscape into a fluid, melting canvas. The light column underfoot becomes a time vortex, drawing the city backward into a primordial ooze.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The boy, mid-gasp, is propelled upward by his jetpack, a vivid energy column beaming down to a pulsing platform. The camera dramatically swoops, revealing the cityscape's flickering lights and busy displays. Drones dart and spin, propellers blurring. Bubbles drift erratically, reflecting distorted neons. A subtle zoom-in on the boy's wide-eyed face emphasizes the fear and exhilaration as the entire scene gently sways, creating an unpredictable, dynamic visual narrative.",
