    "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer of light and water on the blue surface. Small particle effects drifting in the misty light. Barely perceptible chest rise and fall of the silhouette in the alley and the face in the foreground, suggesting breathing. Very subtle light flickering.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A surreal and ethereal movie poster, primarily in shades of deep blue, indigo, and a stark white. The composition features a super-imposed double exposure effect.\n\n**Dominant Foreground Element (Ghostly Silhouette of a Woman):**\nThe primary focus is a large, partially transparent, blurry, and ghostly silhouette of a woman's profile facing right, occupying the lower two-thirds and right side of the poster. Her left shoulder and neck are visible, fading into a textured, almost pixelated or pointillistic blue around the edges. Her facial features are softly blurred, with only a hint of her lips and the contour of her nose and chin discernible. Her hair appears tied back or short. The blue transitions smoothly into pure white on the far right, making her face appear to emerge from or recede into the light.\n\n**Background Element (Urban Alley with Solitary Figure):**\nWithin the upper portion of the woman's silhouette (specifically, filling the space where her head and upper torso would be if fully opaque), there is a starkly rendered, more crisp scene. This scene depicts a lone, silhouetted figure of a person standing centered in a deep blue, narrow urban alleyway or tunnel. The figure is facing away from the viewer. The alley is dimly lit, with subtle light sources creating soft glows and reflections on the wet, dark ground. Blue foliage or moss grows on the walls to the left, and faint, almost abstract architectural details or textures are visible on the surrounding structures. The overall atmosphere of this background scene is melancholic, mysterious, and slightly claustrophobic. Rain or fine mist creates a shimmering, pointillistic texture in the air.\n\n**Color Palette:**\nDominant dark blues and indigos, contrasting with bright, glowing pure white. Subtle hints of lighter blues and turquoises in the background scene for depth.\n\n**Lighting and Atmosphere:**\nMysterious, dreamlike, melancholic, and slightly haunting. The foreground woman's silhouette is softly lit from the right, giving it an ethereal quality. The background scene is lit with internal, almost phosphorescent blue light, enhancing the dreamlike and surreal effect.\n\n**Text Elements (Subtle but Present):**\nOn the lower right, the stylized text \"c29\" in a dark blue, almost black, elegant serif font. Below this, smaller, faint Chinese characters appear, adding to the movie poster aesthetic. The texture of the poster has a slight grain or speckle, especially where the blue and white meet.\n\n**Style:**\nSurrealist photography, double exposure, minimalist movie poster, emotional, high contrast, blue monochrome but with hints of white for dramatic effect. The overall aesthetic feels like a quiet reflection or a memory.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Water's undulating sheen and light refraction across the blue surface. Microscopic particles slowly drift through the misty luminescence. The alley silhouette and foreground face exhibit a faint, rhythmic chest movement, indicating respiration. Gentle, almost imperceptible light wavers throughout.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Intense surge of light and water, violently erupting from the blue surface, coalescing into sharp, jagged forms. A whirlwind of particles explodes outward, propelled by unseen forces. The silhouette in the alley jolts forward, an unnatural, abrupt movement, while the face in the foreground contorts in a sudden, visceral gasp. Violent light flashes rip through the scene, shattering the darkness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A reverse current of luminous mist pulls the silhouette, fragmenting it into shimmering particles that coalesce onto the breathing face. Water droplets inexplicably ascend, forming an ethereal canopy. The face, contorting subtly, reflects inverse ripples that dissolve into the alley's vanishing point. Light pulses out of sync, detaching from its source, then reform, creating illogical shadows that stretch and shrink independently.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow push-in reveals the haunting silhouette in a glistening alley. The camera then subtly tilts down, revealing the soft rise and fall of the foreground subject's chest. As the light shimmers, the camera drifts slowly downward, hinting at watery depths, then a dreamlike, almost imperceptible zoom in on the eyes of the foreground face, catching a flicker of emotion.",
