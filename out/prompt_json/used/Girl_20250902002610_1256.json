  "video_prompt": "A figure's hand slowly raises, their light-blue hair gently swaying. From above, an intense red light beam descends, dramatically broadening into a glowing cross-shape, then narrowing to spotlight the ground. Crimson light pulsates, causing dramatic shadows to dance and shift across the grand space. Fiery red light flickers within gothic windows, while voluminous red curtains ripple softly. Gold accents on architectural details catch glinting reflections as the central light source changes.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed but Concise):**\n\"Low-angle, symmetrical shot: A small, solitary figure with long, light blue hair and a raised hand, back to viewer, stands on a highly reflective dark floor in a vast, opulent, dimly lit hall. An intense red light beam descends from the intricate dark ceiling, forming a glowing red cross-shape and illuminating voluminous crimson curtains, dark ornate pillars, and red-lit gothic windows. Dominated by dramatic deep reds and dark, reflective surfaces, creating a grand, mysterious, and ominous atmosphere.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\"A small, solitary figure with long, light blue hair stands, back to viewer, on a highly reflective dark floor in a vast, opulent, dimly lit hall. Low-angle, symmetrical. An intense red light beam from the ornate ceiling forms a glowing cross-shape, illuminating crimson curtains, dark pillars, and red-lit gothic windows. Dramatic deep reds and dark reflections create a mysterious, grand, and ominous mood.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Very Concise - Focus on Keywords):**\n\"Vast, opulent, dimly lit hall. Low-angle, symmetrical. Solitary figure (small, back to viewer, long light blue hair, hand raised) on highly reflective dark floor. Intense red light beam from intricate dark ceiling, forming glowing red cross. Voluminous crimson curtains, dark ornate pillars, red-lit gothic windows. Deep reds, dark reflections, grand, mysterious, ominous.\"\n\nI recommend **Option 1** or **Option 2** as they strike a good balance between conciseness and providing enough detail for an AI to generate a faithful image. Option 1 is probably the safest to capture all nuances.",

Crimson light pulsates, causing dramatic shadows to dance and shift across the grand space. Fiery red flickers within gothic windows as voluminous red curtains ripple softly. Gold architectural accents glint and reflect, dynamically responding to the central light's transformations."
