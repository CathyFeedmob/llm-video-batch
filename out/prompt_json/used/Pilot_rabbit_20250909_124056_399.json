    "video_prompt": "A gentle rise and fall of the rabbit's chest, subtle blinking of its eyes. The aircraft's propeller blurs with rotation, and the smoke from the distant ship drifts softly upwards. Water around the ship shows subtle ripples and waves, with slight movement of distant boats. A very subtle, slow pan of the camera downwards and right.",
    "image_prompt": "A cinematic, dynamic shot of an anthropomorphic rabbit fighter pilot, wearing goggles and a leather flight jacket, commanding a vintage, propeller-driven biplane. The plane is made of aged, rusty metal with hints of distressed blue paint, showcasing rivets and mechanical details. The perspective is from below, looking up at the plane and the rabbit, as the plane flies over a stormy, choppy sea. Below, a large, grey battleship with smoke trailing from its stern is visible, implying it's either under attack or has sustained damage. Several small, distant boats are also on the water. The sky is dramatic with warm, earthy clouds, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The lighting is rich and atmospheric, with strong contrasts and dramatic shadows that highlight the textures of the plane and the water. The overall color palette leans towards browns, rust, deep blues, and greys, with warm highlights. The image quality is highly detailed, with a painterly yet photorealistic render. The propeller is motion-blurred, emphasizing speed. The composition is diagonal and energetic, drawing the eye from the plane to the ship below.\n\n**Elements:** Anthropomorphic rabbit fighter pilot, vintage biplane, rusty metal, distressed blue paint, propeller (motion blurred), goggles, leather flight jacket, stormy sea, large grey battleship (damaged/smoking), distant small boats, dynamic clouds.\n\n**Style:** Cinematic, dramatic, painterly realism, steampunk-ish.\n\n**Composition:** Low angle shot, diagonal lines, dynamic and energetic.\n\n**Colors:** Browns, rust, deep blues, greys, warm highlights.\n\n**Lighting:** Strong contrasts, dramatic shadows, atmospheric, warm.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Intense, adventurous, slightly ominous.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Gentle chest rise/fall, subtle eye blinks. Propeller blurs, smoke drifts up. Water ripples, distant boats subtly move. Slow, subtle camera pan down-right.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The rabbit pilot’s eyesbug out, ears rotating wildly as the plane's propeller shatters, shards flying! The ship explodes in a fiery, upward geyser of smoke and debris, its hull twisting and buckling. Massive waves erupt around the wreckage, crashing over unseen submersibles that rocket to the surface then violently dive. An unseen force violently jerks the camera and airship sideways and down.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The rabbit's chest pulses with cosmic starlight, its eyes phase-shifting colors. The propeller rips through reality, warping into liquid gold. Smoke from the impossible ship twists into dancing serpents, pulling the ocean's waves upwards into sky-islands, while distant boats morph into shimmering, sentient clouds, all while the camera tumbles through a kaleidoscopic void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Movie Scene Prompt:**\n\nA dramatic close-up on the rabbit's face, eyes darting, followed by a swift zoom-out revealing the war-torn ocean. The aircraft banking steeply, propeller a frantic blur. Smoke billows violently from the besieged battleship as it lurches through crashing waves. Distant boats rock precariously. The camera executes a sweeping flourish downwards and right, emphasizing the chaotic battle below.",
