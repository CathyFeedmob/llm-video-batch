    "video_prompt": "Subtle smoke plumes rise from various points in the distant cityscape. The red lights scattered along the bridges faintly pulse, and a gentle breeze causes the figures' clothing to subtly sway. A very slow, almost imperceptible zoom out reveals more of the decaying landscape below, while a soft glow emanates from the distant sunset.",
    "image_prompt": "A breathtaking, post-apocalyptic cityscape with enormous, decaying suspension bridges dominating the foreground and midground, viewed from a low angle. The sky is a dramatic gradient of smoky gray clouds blending into a vibrant orange sunset on the horizon.\n\n**Elements:**\n- **Foreground:** A crumbling, elevated platform made of rusted metal and debris, suggesting a dilapidated observation deck or part of an older structure. Two silhouetted figures, one adult and one child, stand on this platform, gazing into the distance. Below the platform, a chasm or ravine is visible, filled with twisted wreckage and dark shadows. A rusty, mechanical structure with a red glowing light is positioned to the right of the figures.\n- **Midground:** Towering, ornate suspension bridge towers rise dramatically, their massive, rusted metallic structures covered in intricate frameworks, wires, and glowing red lights strategically placed along their underside and sides. The bridge itself is wide and imposing, showing signs of heavy wear and neglect. Smoke or industrial haze rises around the base of the bridge towers.\n- **Background:** Another, slightly less detailed suspension bridge stretches across the distant cityscape, complementing the bridge in the midground. The horizon is filled with silhouetted city buildings, suggesting a vast, sprawling urban environment partially engulfed in smoke or fog, especially closer to the sunset.\n- **Sky:** Overcast, moody gray clouds in the upper half transitioning into a stunning fiery orange and yellow sunset on the lower half, creating a strong contrast and highlighting silhouetted elements.\n\n**Style:** Concept art, digital painting, cyberpunk with dystopian and industrial elements. Gritty textures, detailed metallic structures, and an overall sense of decay and grandeur.\n\n**Composition:** Vertical orientation. Strong leading lines from the bridges draw the eye upwards and into the receding cityscape. The low angle emphasizes the monumental scale of the bridges. The two figures on the platform create a human element and focal point.\n\n**Colors:** Dominated by a palette of dark, rusty browns, grays, and deep oranges. The glowing red lights on the bridges and machinery provide stark, contrasting accents. The sunset introduces warm yellows and oranges against cool grays.\n\n**Lighting:** Dramatic and atmospheric. Backlighting from the sunset creates strong silhouettes of the figures and the distant city. The red lights on the bridges glow intensely, providing internal illumination and emphasizing the vastness of the structures. Shadows are deep and pronounced, adding to the moody atmosphere.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Dystopian, awe-inspiring, melancholic, desolate yet hopeful, with a sense of lost grandeur and enduring human spirit.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle smoke plumes writhe and dissipate from the cityscape. Red bridge lights rhythmically pulse. Figures' clothing gently sways in a shifting breeze. The view steadily expands to reveal the decaying landscape. A soft glow from the distant sunset subtly brightens and fades.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Explosive, high-energy sequence.** The rusted bridges violently convulse, beams snapping and cables whipping like angry serpents. Red lights burst into blinding flares. The distant cityscape buckles and crumbles as furious plumes of black smoke erupt. The two figures are flung toward the collapsing chasm below, their forms blurring into streaks. The ground ruptures, spewing molten rock and jagged debris upwards. The entire scene distorts, warping into a chaotic maelstrom of destruction before abruptly plunging into absolute darkness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Smoke plumes defy gravity, condensing into shimmering, sentient orbs that drift upwards. Bridge lights pulsate rhythmically, casting impossible geometric shadows that dance across the cityscape. The figures' outlines blur, their clothing shifting into swirling aurora as they slowly invert into the decaying landscape. The sunset fractures into a kaleidoscope, revealing a boundless, pulsating abyss below that pulls the world upward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A decaying bridge spanning a desolate cityscape. A slow, dramatic dolly backward reveals two silhouetted figures standing on a precarious perch. Subtle smoke plumes rise from the distant city as the bridges' red lights faintly pulse. As the wind picks up, their clothes gently ripple. A sudden, sweeping crane shot descends, revealing the vast, decaying landscape below. The camera then circles the figures at a low angle, emphasizing their isolation against the haunting sunset as a gentle glow emanates from it.",
