  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Eye-level full shot of a woman with light brown hair in a bun, facing away but looking over her left shoulder towards the viewer. She wears round gold glasses, a light button-up with rolled sleeves, a light beige form-fitting skirt, and matching high heels. Her right hand holds chalk, her left rests near her knee (without fingernails). She stands before a dark chalkboard with an equation (starting with an S-like symbol) and two erasers on its shelf. The background includes a light wall and medium wood floor. Light from an unseen window casts shadows and illuminates her from the left, highlighting her form. White line-drawn signature in the bottom right corner.",
