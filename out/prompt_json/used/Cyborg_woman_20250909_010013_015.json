    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere, designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A detailed, close-up, cyberpunk-inspired portrait of a young woman with a determined expression, looking slightly to her right. She has realistic, healthy skin texture with subtle pores. Her right cheek and jawline are partially covered by an intricate, metallic, and reflective cybernetic implant.\n\n**Visual Elements & Details:**\n*   **Facial Features:** Soft, clean skin, natural eyebrows, long eyelashes. Her eyes are a warm hazel or light brown, reflecting the bright outdoor light. Her lips are full with a subtle, natural pink-red tint and show slight texture.\n*   **Cybernetic Implant:** The implant is primarily dark metallic (black/dark grey) with polished, reflective silver/chrome accents, particularly on the cheekbone and jaw. It has intricate paneling and sharp design lines, suggesting advanced technology. Several small, glowing lights and lines are integrated into the implant: vibrant cyan/blue sparks or lines emanating near her cheek and jaw, and smaller, bright orange/red lights elsewhere on the device, creating a futuristic, energetic feel. The reflective surfaces of the implant clearly show distorted reflections of the bright, sandy desert environment.\n*   **Hair:** Dark brown hair, casually styled, with loose strands around her face, reflecting some light on the visible areas.\n*   **Details:** Visible subtle veins or faint cracks on her forehead near her temple and above her eyebrow, indicating delicate augmentations or futuristic skin work. A small, almost imperceptible wire or tether connects to one of these forehead markings.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Shot Type:** Extreme close-up portrait, focusing from the upper forehead down to the lower jaw/neck area.\n*   **Angle:** Slightly low-angle, looking up at the subject, emphasizing her strong jawline and the implant. The subject's head is slightly tilted, and she is looking off-camera to her right, creating a sense of thoughtfulness or observation.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The subject's eyes are positioned roughly along the upper horizontal third line, drawing focus to her gaze.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Type:** Strong, natural, outdoor lighting, resembling harsh desert sunlight.\n*   **Direction:** Coming from the top-left, casting strong highlights on her forehead, the top of her nose, her cheekbones, and the reflective parts of the cybernetic implant. This also creates a noticeable shadow along the right side of her nose and cheek, adding depth and contrast.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Bright and clear, implying an open, possibly arid, environment.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Tones:** Warm tones from the skin (peach/tan), light browns of the desert, subtle cool tones from the sky reflection in the implant.\n*   **Accent Colors:** Vibrant cyan/blue and bright orange/red from the implant's lights, providing striking futuristic contrasts against the natural palette.\n*   **Overall:** A blend of natural, warm desert hues with stark, futuristic blues and reds.\n\n**Atmosphere & Mood:**\n*   **Mood:** Serene yet powerful, futuristic, slightly mysterious, contemplative.\n*   **Setting:** A sun-drenched desert background, blurred and out of focus, suggesting vastness and isolation. The muted sand colors (light beige/sandy brown) provide a natural contrast to the advanced technology.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Artistic Style:** Hyperrealistic, photorealistic.\n*   **Influences:** Cyberpunk, sci-fi portraiture, high-definition digital artistry.\n*   **Keywords:** UHD, 8k, detailed, photorealistic, cinematic, professional photography, highly detailed, sharp focus, volumetric lighting.\n\n**Negative Prompts (to ensure specific elements are avoided):**\n*   cartoons, painting, drawing, anime, low quality, distorted, blurry, dull, flat lighting, messy, poor anatomy, extra limbs, multiple heads, text, watermark, signature.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle right-to-left camera drift. Hair gently sways from her right shoulder. Her chest softly rises and falls with breath. Faint sparks and electrical currents pulse across the cybernetic implant.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Cybernetic implant explodes with crackling energy, showering sparks as the cybernetic jaw grinds with metallic shriek. Face contorts, hair lashes violently across the desert wind, eyes burning gold, teeth bared in a feral snarl. The surrounding desert sand whips into a furious vortex, defying gravity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Reality warps as hair strands morph into gossamer spiderwebs, catching reversed time droplets. The cybernetic implant pulsates with ethereal light, sparking celestial dust that defies gravity, floating upwards into a void where desert sand ripples like a liquid sky. Her breath, a visible wisp of cosmic energy, spirals backward into her lips.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Close-up. Slow, deliberate right-to-left camera pull, revealing a weathered face. Faint sparks and electrical currents dance across the cybernetic implant as the character's eye glints with determination. A gentle sway of hair mirrors the barely perceptible rise and fall of the chest, creating a sense of anticipation against the desolate desert backdrop.",
