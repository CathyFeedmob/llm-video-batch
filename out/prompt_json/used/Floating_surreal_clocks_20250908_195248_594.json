    "video_prompt": "Slowly melting clocks, dripping inky tendrils and spheres falling languidly through the clear sky. A subtle breeze rustles the awnings and umbrellas along the street, causing a slight sway. Shadows of distant figures subtly lengthen and shorten as if a cloud passes. The sun glares with a soft, natural lens flare.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A surreal and fantastical urban scene. The sky is a bright, clear blue, with a crescent moon subtly visible. Dominating the upper portion of the frame are two large, ornate clocks, inspired by classic public clocks, with Roman numerals. The clock faces feature a unique, celestial design: half shows a bright, full yellow moon, and the other half shows a dark blue Earth or night sky with stars, suggesting a day and night cycle within the clock. These clocks appear to be melting or dripping, with viscous, dark liquid-like elements dripping downwards and transforming into numerous floating, irregular dark grey orbs of varying sizes. Some of these orbs have long, stretched drips also trailing from them, resembling liquid mercury but solidifying mid-air.\n\nBelow, the scene transitions to a bustling European-style city street, lined with multi-story buildings with classic architecture, balconies, and arched ground-floor sections. The street is a wide, paved plaza, appearing wet and reflective, suggesting recent rain. Several people are walking in the foreground and midground, some carrying open black umbrellas despite the clear sky, reinforcing the surreal element of the falling 'rain' of orbs. The figures are casually dressed, with some men in suits, emphasizing a sense of normalcy amidst the bizarre. Outdoor cafes with white parasols and tables line the sides of the street.\n\nThe lighting is bright and clear, with a warm sun glare visible in the upper right, casting soft shadows. The overall atmosphere is dreamlike, mysterious, and elegantly surreal, with a touch of uncanny beauty. The composition features a strong central perspective, leading the eye down the street. The colors are predominantly blue and gold in the sky, contrasted with the neutral tones of the buildings and the dark figures and umbrellas, with hints of warm yellow from the artificial lighting of the cafes.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Melting clocks drip inky tendrils. Spheres fall languidly. Awnings and umbrellas subtly sway in a breeze. Distant shadows lengthen and shorten. A soft, natural lens flare glares.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Clocks explode into shrapnel, shards raining down as inky tendrils violently lash and coil, grabbing spheres that rocket upward into the sky. Buildings violently twist, balconies ripping off. Umbrellas are torn from hands, spinning erratically. Shadows writhe and contort, morphing into monstrous forms that lunge forward. Sunlight flashes, blinding and strobing. Figures are propelled, fighting against the chaotic storm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Clocks drip upwards, tendrils morphing into celestial bodies. Umbrellas defy gravity, suspending people mid-air. Reflections on the wet ground shimmer, showing future selves walking backward. Distant figures morph into fleeting auras, their shadows twisting into impossible geometric shapes. Light undulates, revealing hidden dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Camera pans right, revealing a bustling street as a slow-drip clock melts in the sky. A suited figure, umbrella in hand, glances heavenward as a metallic sphere drifts past. Shadows stretch and recede as the scene subtly darkens. The camera rapidly zooms into the clock's face, highlighting the day-night celestial dance within.**",
