    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze rustles the hanging maple leaves, causing a few more to detach and drift slowly downwards. The fallen leaves on the path gently shift and slide with subtle implied air currents. Tiny white speckles in the air above the field subtly sparkle and drift. The long shadows cast by the man and the sign slightly lengthen and shift, suggesting a slow passage of time or a gentle movement of the sun.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"A vibrant watercolor painting capturing a serene autumn landscape. The central focus is a man, viewed from behind, dressed in a dark suit, walking away from the viewer down a winding path that cuts through a vast golden wheat field. The path itself is white/light-colored, curving gently into the distance on the left.\n\nTo the right of the path, a rustic wooden signpost stands with an arrow pointing left, bearing the inscription 'This Way' in elegant white cursive font.\n\nAbove, a branch laden with golden-orange maple leaves extends into the frame from the top, with several individual golden leaves gracefully falling or scattered across the light blue and greyish sky, some of which are textured with subtle white speckles resembling light snow or dew. The golden field extends into the horizon under a hazy blue sky.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by warm golden yellows for the field and leaves, contrasting with cool blues and grays for the sky and the shadows on the path. The leaves along the very bottom of the image are larger and more detailed as if close to the viewer, some with subtle green and brown tones mixed in the foreground vegetation. Scattered white specks appear throughout the scene, especially in the sky and on the ground near the path, adding texture and atmosphere.\n\nThe lighting suggests a soft, clear day, casting distinct blue shadows from the man and the signpost onto the path. The artwork has a traditional watercolor style, with visible brushstrokes, subtle blending, and areas of varying pigment density, creating a slightly textured paper feel.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Maple leaves softly sway and detach, fluttering to the ground. Fallen leaves on the path gently stir. Tiny white speckles drift and shimmer in the air. Shadows subtly lengthen and shift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violently gusting wind rips through the maple leaves, sending them plummeting downward in a furious, swirling vortex. The leaves on the path are violently swept away by an unseen force, flinging upwards in a chaotic cascade. White speckles surge and flash like exploding dust. The man's and sign's shadows rapidly contort and stretch, then lash outwards, consuming the field as the ground behind them cracks open.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Crimson leaves gracefully ascend, reattaching to shimmering branches as the man strides backward into an infinite loop. The wooden sign morphs into a prism, scattering liquid light across the path. Shadows ripple like water, swallowing the man whole before spitting out a flock of iridescent butterflies. The horizon warps into a Möbius strip, sending golden fields spiraling into an ethereal sky.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping crane shot ascends, revealing the vast golden field and the man's determined walk. A dramatic zoom-in focuses on a single golden leaf, detaching slowly, spinning as it descends, landing precisely at the man's feet. He pauses, his shadow dramatically lengthening, then steps on the leaf, a ripple of movement across the path's fallen leaves. The camera follows his gaze to the \"This Way\" sign, then pulls back as he decisively strides forward.",
