  "video_prompt": "A brilliant white star-like light explodes and pulses from a domed ceiling, sending dynamic lightning streaks outwards. Below, luminous clouds billow and coil upwards in a magnificent, swirling pillar of light, visibly connecting the scene. A vast assembly of people subtly shift, gazing skyward with collective anticipation as figures ascend a grand staircase. A towering structure at the top glows, emanating or absorbing the rising energy. The entire environment is alive with constantly shifting light and shadow.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging in conciseness, suitable for an image generation model:\n\n**Option 1 (Most Concise):**\n\n> Vertical shot of an immense, ethereal, cathedral-like structure. A cosmic oculus domed ceiling with ornate arches, featuring an exploding brilliant white starburst with intense light rays and lightning streaks across a star-dusted blue expanse. A magnificent pillar of swirling, luminous white and light blue clouds ascends. In the foreground, a vast crowd (from behind, dark attire) in a semicircular amphitheater gazes upwards, with figures climbing a majestic staircase towards a glowing, spired temple. Flanked by dark spires. Cool blues and brilliant whites. Epic, awe-inspiring, spiritual.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly more detail, if the model benefits from it):**\n\n> Grand, vertical, ethereal cathedral-like scene. Above, an immense domed ceiling, resembling a cosmic oculus, features ornate architecture. A supremely bright, white star-like light explodes from the center, casting intense light rays and jagged, lightning-like energy streaks across a blue, star-dusted dome. Below, a magnificent pillar of swirling, luminous white and light blue clouds rises. In the lower half, a vast assembly of people (seen from behind, dark attire) fills a semicircular amphitheater, looking up a majestic staircase where figures in dark suits ascend towards a glowing, spired castle-like building. Flanked by dark, sharp spires. Dominated by cool blues and brilliant whites, creating an epic, awe-inspiring, spiritual mood.\n\n**Key elements condensed and incorporated:**\n\n*   **Overall setting:** \"Immense, ethereal, cathedral-like structure,\" \"vertical shot,\" \"grand scene.\"\n*   **Dome:** \"Cosmic oculus domed ceiling,\" \"ornate arches,\" \"exploding brilliant white starburst,\" \"intense light rays, lightning streaks,\" \"star-dusted blue expanse.\"\n*   **Ascending Energy:** \"Magnificent pillar of swirling, luminous white and light blue clouds ascends/rises.\"\n*   **Foreground/People:** \"Vast crowd (from behind, dark attire) in a semicircular amphitheater,\" \"gazing upwards/looking up.\"\n*   **Staircase/Destination:** \"Majestic staircase,\" \"figures climbing/ascending,\" \"glowing, spired temple/castle-like building.\"\n*   **Flanking Structures:** \"Flanked by dark, sharp spires.\"\n*   **Color/Mood:** \"Cool blues and brilliant whites,\" \"Epic, awe-inspiring, spiritual.\"\n\nChoose the option that best fits the input token limit and preference of your specific image generation model. Option 1 is generally a good starting point for its balance of detail and brevity.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "A star-like light explodes and pulses from a domed ceiling, dynamic lightning streaking outwards. Below, luminous clouds billow and coil upwards, forming a swirling pillar of light that visually links the environment. A vast assembly of people subtly shift, gazing skyward with collective anticipation as figures ascend a grand staircase. A towering structure at the top glows, actively emanating or absorbing the rising energy. The entire environment pulsates with constantly shifting light and shadow."
