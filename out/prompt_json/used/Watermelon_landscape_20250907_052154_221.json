    "video_prompt": "Here's a video generation prompt for the image, focusing on subtle movements and animations:\n\nWater cascades subtly from the stem, flowing into the upper pool where its surface gently ripples. The waterfall into the lower pool also shows continuous, soft flow. The surface of the lower pool subtly shimmers. The leaves on the miniature trees gently rustle. The girls' hair and dresses subtly sway as if from a light breeze. A very subtle, slow zoom out reveals more of the watermelon's scale.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed prompt to recreate the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA surreal and whimsical scene depicting a sliced watermelon transformed into a miniature landscape. The top portion of the watermelon is cut horizontally, revealing the vibrant red flesh and black seeds. From the stem of the top slice, a pristine light blue waterfall cascades down into a pool of water, then flows over another edge into a second, lower pool. Lush, miniature green trees and bushes are meticulously arranged around the water features, simulating a verdant landscape within the fruit. Two tiny figures, appearing as miniature people, stand hand-in-hand on the lower watermelon slice, looking towards the waterfalls. The lighting is bright and inviting, creating a cheerful, refreshing atmosphere. The background is a soft, solid light green, putting full focus on the watermelon scene. Clean, sharp focus throughout.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** A large, ripe watermelon, sliced horizontally. The top slice is positioned above the bottom slice, creating a tiered effect.\n*   **Watermelon Details:** Deep red flesh, realistic black seeds embedded, light green rind visible on the exterior and as a thin border around the flesh.\n*   **Miniature Landscape:**\n    *   **Waterfalls:** Two clear, light blue waterfalls. The upper one originates from the stem area of the top slice, flowing into a circular pool. The lower one spills from the upper pool's edge into a second, lower circular pool on the bottom slice.\n    *   **Water Pools:** Two serene, circular pools of light blue water with gentle ripples.\n    *   **Foliage:** Densely packed, tiny green deciduous trees and bushes, sculpted to appear naturally growing on the watermelon flesh, particularly around the water features. The foliage has a slightly textured, almost moss-like appearance.\n*   **Figures:** Two small, human-like figures, one in a white dress, one in a light blue dress, holding hands and standing on the bottom watermelon slice, facing the waterfalls. They are proportionally tiny compared to the watermelon.\n\n**Style:**\n*   Surreal and whimsical macro photography/diorama style.\n*   Clean, sharp, and highly detailed.\n*   Playful and inviting.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   Vertical orientation.\n*   The watermelon dominates the frame, positioned centrally.\n*   The sliced sections provide natural platforms and boundaries for the miniature landscape.\n*   The waterfalls act as focal points, leading the eye downwards.\n*   The figures are placed to draw attention to the scale and interactive nature of the scene.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Dominant: Vibrant red (watermelon flesh), dark green (watermelon rind), bright light blue (water), lush mid-green (miniature foliage), soft light green (background).\n*   Accents: Black (watermelon seeds), dark brown (tree trunks).\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   Bright, clean, and even illumination.\n*   Soft shadows that define form without being harsh, suggesting an indoor studio light setup.\n*   Highlights on the water's surface, giving it a luminous quality.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   Refreshing, calm, imaginative, and peaceful. Evokes a sense of miniature wonder and natural beauty.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle water flow intensifies, causing cascading ripples to expand. Wind picks up, dramatically swaying hair, dresses, and rustling leaves. The zoom-out accelerates, revealing the full scale rapidly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The watermelon violently splits open, revealing a roaring torrent plunging dramatically into the abyss. Water blasts from upper pool, erupting into a geyser. The lower pool violently churns, tossing miniature trees skyward. The girls, suddenly animated, sprint for their lives as the watermelon core throbs ominously and bursts with radiant energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Waterfalls defy gravity, flowing upwards and coalescing into floating spheres. Watermelon seeds detach, spiraling into bioluminescent butterflies that flutter around the miniature trees. The trees bloom with edible crystals that shimmer and dissolve. The girls float above the watermelon, their dresses transforming into shimmering liquid, and they begin to swim through the air. The watermelon itself pulsates with an inner light, slowly morphing into a giant, living heart.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically pulls back from a close-up on the watermelon's stem, revealing a torrent of water cascading into the upper pool. A sweeping cinematic shot follows the intensified flow as it plunges into the lower pool, the water dramatically churning. The camera then swiftly tracks a single watermelon seed as it becomes dislodged and tumbles down the inner \"wall,\" coming to rest near the girls. Finally, a slow, deliberate zoom out showcases the entire watermelon tableau.",
