    "video_prompt": "A subtle shift in the mist around the Alien's body, its segmented tail gently swaying, minute glints of light reflecting off its polished biomechanical surface, and the ever-so-slight twitch of its fingers as if about to move. A slow, subtle zoom out reveals more of the misty, dark forest.",
    "image_prompt": "a sleek, biomechanical alien xenomorph, reminiscent of the \"Alien\" film franchise, in an outdoor, misty forest setting. The xenomorph is largely black with reflective surfaces and intricate, dark metal-like details, highlighted with faint, glowing orange or blue accents in its joints and crevices. It has elongated limbs, a large, ridged head, sharp teeth, and several tentacle-like protrusions from its back.\n\nThe alien is captured in a dynamic stance, as if cautiously moving or observing its surroundings. The background features blurred, soft-focus trees and foliage, suggesting a damp, foggy atmosphere. The overall lighting is dim and atmospheric, with diffused light that emphasizes the xenomorph's glossy texture and detailed structure. The composition is a full-body shot of the alien, positioned off-center, allowing for a sense of depth and environment. The mood is eerie, mysterious, and slightly menacing.\n\n**Elements:** biomechanical alien, xenomorph, forest, mist, fog, black, reflective, metallic, glowing accents, sharp teeth, tentacles, fern, trees\n\n**Composition:** full body shot, dynamic pose, off-center, shallow depth of field, blurred background\n\n**Lighting:** dim, atmospheric, diffused, highlight on metallic surfaces\n\n**Colors:** predominantly dark (black, deep grays), muted greens and browns in background, subtle orange and blue glowing accents\n\n**Atmosphere:** eerie, mysterious, damp, foggy, cinematic\n\n**Style:** sci-fi, horror, creature design, hyperrealistic, 3D render, digital art",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle mist dissipates around the Alien, its segmented tail gently swaying. Light glints off its biomechanical surface as fingers twitch. A slow, subtle zoom out reveals more of the misty, dark forest.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The Xenomorph, a blur of motion, erupts forward. Its segmented tail lashes violently, pulverizing ancient ferns. The polished carapace flashes as the creature lunges, claws ripping through the mist, transforming it into a volatile whirlwind. Trees buckle and snap as the biomechanical horror crashes through the forest, its jaw distending with a guttural shriek, a primal force unleashed.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The Alien's polished body ripples into liquid, reforming as shimmering, translucent flora that floats upwards into the mist, which then solidifies into shimmering, impossibly sharp crystals, endlessly falling upwards into a sky that is slowly unraveling into pure light. The forest morphs into an inverted, subterranean cavern of glowing fungi, its roots now tendrils grasping at the fading void above.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic push-in to the Alien's head, steam subtly rising from its polished dome. The camera pulls back, revealing its menacing stance in the misty forest. A sudden, sharp pan follows its segmented tail as it whips, then glints of light catch its biomechanical surface. The camera subtly dips, following the slight twitch of its fingers, culminating in a wide, sweeping crane shot as the Alien slowly turns, its silhouette vanishing into the shifting fog.",
