  "video_prompt": "Transition a tree from vibrant spring foliage to stark winter branches on one side, while the other side remains lush. Snow accumulates and melts. Leaves change color and fall. The sky shifts from clear to cloudy, hinting at temperature changes. Distant fields alternate between green, golden, and snow-covered.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Illustrative artwork of a tree split vertically, showcasing two seasons simultaneously. Left side: lush green leaves, bright lime new growth, warm pale blue sky with warm glow, green and golden fields, blue/purple hills. Right side: bare snow-laden branches, golden-yellow autumn leaves, cold deep blue sky, snow-covered field with golden patches, distant mountains. Minimalist style, clean lines, distinct color blocks.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "One half of the tree's foliage rapidly cycles through vibrant growth, autumn's color shift, and winter's bare branches, while the other half remains perpetually lush. Snow drifts build then recede across the landscape. Leaves detach and spiral downwards. The sky's condition dramatically evolves, transitioning from clear expanses to heavy cloud cover, subtly hinting at temperature shifts. Distant fields dynamically shift through shades of green, golden, and white as snow covers and uncovers them."
