  "video_prompt": "Intense, glowing red eyes hold a direct, enigmatic gaze, lips subtly parting. Loose dark hair strands and red ribbons gently sway. Silver drop earrings and a choker's pendant softly swing with a subtle head turn. As the figure slowly pivots, a mini-skirt ripples and decorative thigh straps dance. A large crescent moon behind pulses with a soft, white glow, dynamically silhouetting the figure against darkness.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt, retaining key details and aesthetic:\n\n\"Anime style digital illustration, full-body shot of a young woman with a striking dark gothic punk aesthetic. Confident expression. She has dark hair in a messy high bun with red ribbons and black kanzashi, vivid glowing red eyes, pale skin, and small red lips. She wears a black choker with a silver cross, a layered top featuring a strapless black bandeau with a large red satin bow and white ruffle trim over an asymmetrical white corset exposing a toned midriff with delicate white body art. She has asymmetrical black fingerless gloves and sharp red nails. Her lower body includes an asymmetrical black mini-skirt, a wide black belt with silver buckles and O-rings, a black garter, and a single sheer black thigh-high stocking, with one leg bare. She stands against a stark black background, dramatically framed by a glowing white crescent moon halo from behind. High contrast black, white, and red color palette, crisp lines, smooth shading, dramatic backlighting, edgy, alluring mood.\"",
