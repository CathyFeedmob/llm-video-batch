    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle chest undulation, gentle hair and fabric sway, shifting glints on silver headpiece and jewelry, slow eye blinks, delicate face glitter shimmer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden, violent head-toss, silver headpiece clanging and scattering light like shattered glass. Hair whips across the face, then snaps back, revealing eyes flashing open in wide-eyed shock. Shoulder lunges forward, fabric tears and ripples like a disturbed surface, skin twisting. Earrings swing wildly, scattering droplets of light, then yank back with force. A violent gust of wind whips across the face, swirling the glitter into a chaotic storm.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The silver headpiece floats upwards, fragments detaching and reforming into shimmering butterflies that flutter around her. Eyes open, revealing galaxies swirling within, then close, pulling distant stars into her pupils. Hair slowly disentangles from her head, coalescing into droplets that stream upwards, condensing into a celestial mist around the crown. The fabric of her dress melts, reforming into a liquid silver cascade that pours skyward, defying gravity to envelop the entire scene in a shimmering, impossible embrace.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Begin with a slow, dramatic push-in, the camera subtly tilting upward to reveal the glistening silver headpiece and its intricate details. A gentle breeze causes the hair and fabric to sway in elegant, synchronized undulations. As the camera continues its delicate approach, catch the soft, ephemeral glint of highlights dancing across the silver and the subtle, almost imperceptible shimmer of glitter on the face. Finally, a close-up frames the eyes as they slowly, intensely blink, revealing a profound depth of emotion before the scene fades to black.",
