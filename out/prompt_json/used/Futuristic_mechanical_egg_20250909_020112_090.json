    "video_prompt": "Subtle internal red glow pulsating with a soft shimmer, tiny gears and cogs within the mechanism slowly rotating.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed 3D rendering of a futuristic, spherical mechanical egg, inspired by industrial design, steampunk, and hardsurface modeling. The egg-like object is black with red accents, featuring intricate gold and silver metallic gears, pistons, wires, and internal mechanisms visible through openings. Bright red internal glow illuminates parts of the interior and casts a subtle red light reflection on the surface and the ground. The object is slightly angled, resting on a clean, light gray seamless background. In the foreground, slightly to the right, are the golden 3D letters \"c29\" with a small raised \"®\" symbol near the \"9\". The lighting is studio-style, with soft, even illumination highlighting the metallic textures and creating subtle shadows. The mood is sophisticated and technological. Captured with a professional camera lens, f/2.8 aperture, 85mm focal length. --ar 2:3",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle internal red glow pulsating, emanating from gears and cogs slowly rotating within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive internal mechanisms blast open, revealing a chaotic frenzy of gears and cogs whirring at impossible speeds, propelled by raw, surging power. Red light flares intensely, casting sharp, dancing shadows as the entire structure violently convulses and spins. Components rupture, showering sparks and debris. The core pulses with aggressive, dynamic bursts of light and energy, threatening imminent self-destruction as it wildly vibrates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The metallic egg, still glowing, detaches from its anchor, then effortlessly splits into a flurry of golden gears and red light particles, each element spiraling inward, before coalescing into liquid mercury which then solidifies into a single, shimmering tear that floats upwards and vanishes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping camera crane shot dramatically reveals the intricate, egg-shaped mechanism, its black plating sharply contrasting with the internal, pulsating red glow. A slow, cinematic zoom pushes in, focusing on the subtle internal red glow pulsating with a soft shimmer, as tiny brass gears and cogs within the mechanism slowly, almost theatrically, rotate, their polished surfaces catching the ethereal light. A final, tight shot lands on the \"C29\" logo at its base, hinting at its mysterious origins.",
