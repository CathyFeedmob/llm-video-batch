  "video_prompt": "A powerful sorceress intensifies her magic. Her luminous blue eyes glow, hair subtly sways. The gemstone at her throat pulses with light. Her raised hands gesture, channeling a swirling stream of ethereal white and blue energy emanating from her palm. Above her, a vast magical circle pulsates, its intricate pentagram and celestial symbols forming and glowing brighter. A brilliant blue orb at its center shimmers. Sparkling particles of light intensely float and concentrate around the magic. Dynamic cool blue and white light shifts and intensifies, casting dramatic, dancing shadows across ancient gothic stone walls. Stained-glass windows softly pulse with mystical light. Her serene expression shifts to deep concentration as the magic climaxes.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, ranging from slightly more detailed to very concise, depending on the model's expected input length:\n\n---\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Comprehensive):**\n\n```\nA powerful young female sorceress, serene and focused, with luminous blue eyes and a short indigo-blue bob.

Cool-toned palette: blues, silver, grey, deep black, brilliant white highlights. Mystical, powerful atmosphere. Art style: Anime-inspired character, realistic textures, digital painting, high fantasy.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\n```\nSerene young sorceress with luminous blue eyes and an indigo-blue bob, wearing a metallic silver-grey futuristic armor-gown. She casts swirling white and blue magic from her left hand.
