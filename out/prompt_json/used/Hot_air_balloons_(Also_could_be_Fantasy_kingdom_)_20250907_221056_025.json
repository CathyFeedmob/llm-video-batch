    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA vibrant, fantastical landscape featuring numerous hot air balloons of various sizes and colorful chevron patterns (red, yellow, blue, green, pink) floating under a clear, bright blue sky with wispy clouds. In the midground and background, dramatic, rugged mountains with sharp, textured peaks dominate the scene. Nestled within these mountains are several majestic, intricate castles and elegant buildings with multiple turrets, domes (some blue), arched windows, and detailed stonework. A meandering river with distinct waterfalls flows through the valley between the mountains, its water a clear, vibrant turquoise. Along the riverbanks and on the terraced mountain slopes, there are lush trees displaying autumn foliage in shades of golden yellow, orange, and deep red, mixed with evergreen conifers. Small heart-shaped balloons (pink) are interspersed among the larger hot air balloons. The overall atmosphere is whimsical, adventurous, and grand.\n\n**Aspects covered:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Hot air balloons, castles, mountains, river, waterfalls, autumn trees.\n*   **Visual Elements:**\n    *   **Hot air balloons:** Numerous, various sizes, colorful chevron patterns (red, yellow, blue, green, pink), distinct baskets, some heart-shaped (pink).\n    *   **Mountains:** Dramatic, rugged, sharp, textured peaks, brown/earth tones.\n    *   **Castles/Buildings:** Majestic, intricate, multiple turrets, domes (some blue), arched windows, detailed stonework, European fantasy style.\n    *   **River:** Meandering, clear turquoise water, distinct waterfalls.\n    *   **Vegetation:** Lush trees, autumn foliage (golden yellow, orange, deep red), evergreen conifers, green grass.\n*   **Style:** Fantastical, whimsical, grand, detailed, illustrative.\n*   **Composition:** Wide shot, layered depth (foreground balloons/mountains, midground castles/river, background mountains/balloons), aerial perspective for some elements.\n*   **Colors:** Predominantly vibrant primary/secondary colors for balloons, earthy browns for mountains, rich greens/yellows/reds for foliage, bright turquoise for water, clear blue for sky.\n*   **Lighting:** Bright, natural daylight, soft shadows suggesting diffused light.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Adventurous, peaceful, majestic, inviting.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Hot air balloons violently burst across the sky, their tattered remains plummeting downward. The river rages, churning water upward in geysers, then slamming back down the waterfalls. Trees writhe and twist, their branches thrashing wildly. Storm clouds gather, lightning illuminating the sky as the castle windows explode outward, glass shattering into a thousand fragments.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gigantic hot air balloons, defying gravity, slowly shrink and grow, their kaleidoscopic patterns swirling like liquid. The river, a ribbon of shattered mirrors, flows *upward* into cascading waterfalls that invert into swirling vortexes, then condense into crystal trees. Castle windows ripple, reflecting impossible galaxies. Clouds materialize and vanish, forming ephemeral beings that chase the balloons. Leaves on autumn trees dance with bioluminescent light, phasing through solid rock.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide, sweeping drone shot reveals a majestic castle nestled amidst towering mountains. Hot air balloons, vibrant against the twilight sky, subtly drift. A slow zoom-in focuses on a waterfall, its gentle cascade catching the soft glint of the setting sun. The camera steadily tracks one balloon as it passes over the castle, revealing flickering lights in the windows.",
