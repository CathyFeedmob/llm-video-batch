    "video_prompt": "\"Subtle steam rises and wafts from the cup's rim. Individual chalets sway gently on their cables. Tiny figures subtly shift their positions. Water in the miniature pond ripples softly. The chandelier lights flicker warmly. Droplets on the cup glisten and slowly slide downwards, while light glints within the liquid spilling on the saucer.\"",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating this image:\n\n\"A surreal and fantastical scene, where a large teal ceramic mug serves as a miniature world. The rim of the mug is covered in lush, vibrant green moss, forming a rolling landscape with miniature buildings resembling ornate stone structures with glowing windows, tucked into the moss. Tiny figures of people are scattered across this mossy landscape, some holding small white umbrellas. A glistening, tranquil pond or lake is nestled in the center of the mossy terrain. Above, miniature brown and dark grey cable cars on thin wires traverse the upper part of the scene, with wisps of steam or mist rising into the dark background. One prominent dandelion seed head stands tall in the moss.\n\nBelow the moss and cascading down the sides of the mug, numerous delicate water droplets cling and slowly drip, some stretching into long, shimmering trails. The interior of the mug glows with a warm, magical light, transitioning from bright gold at the top to a rich, deep brown at the bottom, mimicking a starry or enchantedliquid. Hanging within this luminous interior is an intricate, sparkling crystal chandelier with multiple glowing candles, reflecting the golden light.\n\nThe base of the mug sits on a dark, textured surface, where a rich, dark brown liquid has gently spilled and pooled, with subtle reflections. The lighting is ethereal and moody, with clear distinctions between the brightly lit miniature world and the darker, atmospheric background. The overall style is a blend of whimsical fantasy and hyperrealism, with a dreamlike atmosphere. The composition is a close-up, eye-level shot focused on the mug, showcasing the intricate details of the miniature world and the magical elements within and around it.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are some refined video prompts focusing exclusively on dynamic elements:\n\n*   **Prompt 1 (Focus: Organic Flow):** Steam subtly unfurls and weaves above the cup. Chalets on cables exhibit a gentle, natural swing. Water in the pond softly undulates as light refracts through the ripples. Droplets on the cup glisten, expanding and descending, while light dances within the spilling liquid.\n\n*   **Prompt 2 (Focus: Specific Motion):** Wisps of steam gracefully ascend and disperse from the cup's edge. Chalets sway with a uniform, rhythmic motion. Miniature figures subtly reposition themselves. The pond's surface features expanding, concentric ripples. Chandelier lights actively dim and brighten.\n\n*   **Prompt 3 (Focus: Interactive Change):** Steam undulates and dissipates from the cup. Chalets rock gently, their movement affecting each other. Figures subtly adjust their stance. Water in the pond shimmers and shifts with subtle currents. Lights within the chandelier pulsate softly. Droplets slowly descend the cup, creating trails as liquid on the saucer catches and reflects light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Steam explodes from the cup, violently erupting. Chalets violently collide and shatter along the cables. Figures morph into chaotic blurs, scrambling and collapsing. The pond water surges upwards, forming a raging vortex. The chandelier bursts into blinding flashes, casting chaotic shadows. Droplets on the cup defy gravity, shooting upwards and then violently splattering, igniting the liquid spewing across the saucer into fiery sparks.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Chalet cables morph into vibrant vines, pulling the chalets downward. Miniature figures shimmer into sparkling stardust, orbiting the pond. Gravity reverses, pulling spilled liquid upwards into the cup, then overflowing as shimmering mist. The chandelier's light becomes a swirling vortex, drawing droplets from the cup's rim into its core. The pond's surface reflects an inverse sky as the entire scene gently rotates.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly pushes in, steam gently curling from the cup's rim. A subtle shift of light illuminates miniature chalets as they sway, revealing tiny figures moving with deliberate grace. As a dramatic zoom emphasizes the ripple in the pond, the camera glides down, catching the warm flicker of the chandelier. A droplet lengthens, slowly detaching, followed by an unexpected surge as the liquid dramatically spills onto the saucer.",
