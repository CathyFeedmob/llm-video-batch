    "video_prompt": "A subtle breath in and out, the macrame dress subtly shifting with the movement. A few stray strands of hair around her face gently sway. Her eyes slowly blink.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A slender, fair-skinned female figure, presented from the waist up. She has delicate, almost otherworldly features, with light blonde hair styled in a messy bun adorned with thin braids or rope-like strands wrapped around her head, and a few loose strands framing her face. Her eyes are light, with a slightly upward tilt at the outer corner, and she has soft, natural-looking makeup.\n\n**Outfit:** She is wearing an intricate, light beige or natural-colored macrame-style dress or top, crafted from thick, knotted ropes rather than fine thread. The design features open netting with distinct, square-patterned crochet elements covering the breasts, connected by a network of knots and ropes that extend over her shoulders, around her neck like a choker, and down her torso, revealing much of her skin. There are dangling rope elements with tassels extending from the shoulders/back.\n\n**Composition:** Medium close-up shot, angled slightly from her right side, showing her profile looking towards the left of the frame. Her head is angled slightly down, giving her a contemplative or serene expression. The upper half of her body fills the majority of the vertical space, with ample headroom and a bit of negative space to the left of her face. The macrame garment is clearly visible and forms a striking visual element.\n\n**Style:** High-resolution, hyperrealistic photography with a soft, ethereal aesthetic. The image should have a clean, minimalist feel, reminiscent of fine art portraiture or a fashion editorial.\n\n**Colors:** Dominated by natural, muted tones. The primary colors are the light beige/natural color of the macrame outfit and skin, contrasted with a soft, cool blue-grey background. Her hair is a very light blonde.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused, natural-looking light coming from the front and slightly to the left, creating subtle highlights on her skin and the texture of the macrame. There are gentle shadows that define her features and the depth of the knotted garment. The overall light is bright but not harsh, contributing to the serene atmosphere.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Calm, ethereal, and subtly artistic. The overall impression is one of delicate beauty and intricate craftsmanship.\n\n**Additional details (important for realism):**\n* The skin should have a smooth, almost porcelain-like quality.\n* The texture of the macrame ropes and knots should be highly detailed and tactile.\n* The background is a soft, solid wash of color, slightly darker at the top and fading subtly towards the bottom, with no discernible patterns or objects.\n* A subtle luminous quality to her skin, especially around her cheekbone and forehead.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle chest rise and fall, dress fabric sways gently, hair strands around face softly drift, eyelids slowly lower and lift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The macrame dress wildly billows, ropes whipping and braiding around her body. Her hair explodes in a storm of tangled strands, eyes snapping open with an electrifying glow. The air around her ripples, distorting reality as tendrils of light erupt from her form, carving through the scene with explosive force, shattering the peaceful stillness into a whirlwind of surreal energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The macrame dress unravels into shimmering threads, floating upwards to weave into a crystalline aurora around her head. Her eyes invert into starlit nebulae, blinking black holes. The 'C 29' forms a swirling vortex, pulling hair strands into its depth, only to emerge as luminescent butterflies, before reforming back into the original image.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-in from a high angle reveals the macrame dress, subtly shifting with an unseen breath. As the camera sweeps around her, golden light illuminates her profile. A sudden, sharp breath, the ropes tighten, and her eyes, wide with a flicker of amber, dart left, then right. The camera rapidly dollies back, revealing her surrounded by a swirling, shadowy mist.",
