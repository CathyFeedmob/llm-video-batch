    "image_prompt": "A whimsical, highly detailed diorama cake depicting an idyllic landscape. The cake itself is a large, cylindrical, multi-tiered structure, with the top tier serving as the primary landscape.\n\n**Overall Composition:**\nThe top surface of the cake features a flowing river of light blue and turquoise, with bright glowing yellow edges, winding through vibrant green grassy islands. Two chocolate brown mountains with white snowy peaks rise from these islands. A miniature suspension bridge spans across the river, connecting two islands. Tiny human figurines are scattered across the landscape, seemingly engaged in activities like fishing or digging. A small sailboat with orange sails rests on one of the grassy areas near the river. A miniature utility pole with wires stands on another island. The lower tiers of the cake are covered in green and white frosting with swirling patterns, suggesting a continuing landscape or abstract design. Small black and white bird figurines are \"flying\" around the sides of the cake.\n\n**Specific Elements and Details:**\n*   **River:** Made of a glossy, translucent blue and turquoise material, appearing like flowing water. The edges of the river glow with a bright yellow light, casting reflections.\n*   **Islands/Land:** Covered in bright green, textured \"grass\" that looks like small crumbs or sprinkles. The two mountains are a rich chocolate brown, textured to resemble rock, with smooth white icing on top to represent snow-capped peaks. One mountain has cubes stacked on top, possibly representing sugar cubes or building blocks.\n*   **Bridge:** A detailed miniature suspension bridge, made of silver-colored material, with cables and vertical supports, spanning across the river.\n*   **Figurines:** Small, roughly 1-2 inch tall, human figurines dressed in various colored clothes (red, blue, brown, grey). They hold miniature tools like shovels or fishing poles.\n*   **Sailboat:** A small, detailed wooden sailboat with orange sails, resting on a green island near the river.\n*   **Utility Pole:** A brown miniature utility pole with cross-arms and thin wires stretching across, resembling an actual power pole.\n*   **Clouds:** Two fluffy white clouds made of a soft material (like cotton or sugar cotton) float above the landscape.\n*   **Cake Sides:** The cylindrical sides of the cake are predominantly green and white, with swirled patterns suggesting clouds, wind, or abstract terrain. The base of the cake has brown crumbly texture.\n*   **Birds:** Several small, black and white bird figurines are positioned on the sides of the cake, giving the impression of flight.\n\n**Style & Atmosphere:**\nThe style is highly realistic for a miniature scene, but with the undeniable context of being a creative cake. It's whimsical, charming, and detailed, evoking a sense of miniature craftsmanship. The glowing river adds a magical or ethereal touch.\n\n**Lighting:**\nBright, even, natural-looking lighting that highlights the intricate details and textures. The yellow glowing edges of the river provide internal illumination.\n\n**Colors:**\nDominant colors are various shades of green (for land), blue/turquoise (for water), brown (for mountains/boat), silver (for bridge), and white (for snow/cake base/clouds). Accents of yellow (river glow) and red/blue (figurine clothing).\n\nThis prompt aims to generate a visually appealing and detailed image of a diorama cake, emphasizing its miniature landscape, intricate elements, and vibrant, fantastical charm.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle shifts: figures dig/rake; water flows/shimmers; sailboat mast sways; clouds drift; birds flap/glide. Camera pans right.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Explosive tremors rip through the cake-world, sending miniature figures tumbling. Rivers rage, spewing water skyward in geysers. The bridge shudders and violently twists. Sugar mountains explode into a shower of crumbs. Clouds crackle with lightning, morphing into ominous storm fronts. The sailboat violently capsizes as waves surge. Birds dive-bomb with unnatural speed, their wingbeats echoing like thunder. A dramatic, rapid pan reveals chaotic disintegration.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity inverts, workers ascend, still digging the earth as it peels upwards in swirling green ribbons. Water flows skyward, transforming into molten gold, then back to azure, its light dissolving into nebulous clouds that pulse with liquid shimmer. The sailboat melts into a flock of luminescent birds, their wingbeats echoing silence as they dive into the ground. Bridges ripple and reform like cosmic dust, connecting impossible landscapes. Time fractures, with figures simultaneously digging and undigging. A surreal camera pan reveals a universe woven from pure imagination.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping cinematic drone shot reveals miniature figures digging furiously, their tools glinting as a vibrant river shimmers with ethereal light. The camera pushes in dramatically, revealing a sailboat's mast swaying precariously, almost pitching the tiny vessel. Clouds drift eerily, casting fleeting shadows. A sudden, sharp pan follows miniature birds as they dart and dive, their wings a blur. The gentle current intensifies, reflecting a dynamic interplay of light and shadow, hinting at an unseen force.",
