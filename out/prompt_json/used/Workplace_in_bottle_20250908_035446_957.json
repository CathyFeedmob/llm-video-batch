    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA surreal high-definition close-up shot of a clear glass bottle, resembling a miniature spirit or apothecary bottle, standing vertically on a minimalist grey surface. Inside the bottle, a multi-story, modular office building is perfectly fitted. The building is comprised of numerous identical cubicles, arranged in neat rows and columns across several illuminated floors. Each cubicle features a tiny miniature figure seated at a desk, looking at a computer screen. Some cubicles also contain small potted plants or miniature bookshelves. The interior lighting of the office building is bright and even, highlighting the details within each cubicle. The overall lighting is soft and ambient, casting subtle reflections and refractions on the glass bottle, which are particularly visible near the base and around the metallic screw-top lid. The background is a smooth, gradient grey, creating a clean and isolated feel. The composition is centered, with a shallow depth of field that subtly blurs the very top of the bottle cap and the extreme foreground. The style is hyperrealistic with meticulous attention to miniature detail, conveying a sense of confinement, organization, and a commentary on modern work life. A faint white \"c29\" logo is subtly overlaid in the bottom right corner, suggesting a brand or series.\n\n**Breakdown of elements used:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Clear glass bottle, miniature multi-story office building inside.\n*   **Key Details (Inside Bottle):** Modular cubicles, tiny figures at desks, computer screens, potted plants, bookshelves, internally illuminated floors.\n*   **Bottle Details:** Metallic screw-top lid, reflections and refractions on glass.\n*   **Setting:** Minimalist grey surface.\n*   **Background:** Smooth, gradient grey.\n*   **Lighting:** Bright internal office lights, soft ambient overall lighting, subtle reflections/refractions.\n*   **Composition:** Centered, close-up, vertical orientation, shallow depth of field.\n*   **Style:** Surreal, high-definition, hyperrealistic, miniature scale, meticulous detail.\n*   **Atmosphere/Mood:** Confinement, organization, modern work life, clean, isolated.\n*   **Text Overlay:** Faint white \"c29\" in bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The camera subtly pulls back. The light within the bottle gently pulses. Miniature workers' screens subtly shimmer with changing data.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A subtle zoom out, with the light inside the bottle flickering slightly and the miniature workers' computer screens displaying very subtle, random changes in content.\n\n**Aggressive Dynamic Prompt:**\n\nBottle shatters, erupting miniature workers into a frantic, chaotic dance! Desks explode, screens glitch wildly to reveal monstrous, shifting faces, and the entire \"office\" structure twists and pulsates, a living cage. Light strobes violently, plunging the scene into shadow then blinding flashes, as the bottle reconstitutes and then re-shatters repeatedly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The entire bottle, employees included, slowly unzips from its metallic cap, gently unraveling into a luminous, flowing river of light that pours upwards towards the sky. The river shimmers, morphing into a swarm of bioluminescent fireflies, each carrying a tiny desk and worker, flying erratically. The computer screens expand to fill the entire frame, displaying constellations before imploding back into the fireflies, as the bottle slowly re-zips itself, inside out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom-out from the frantic, miniaturized office inside a glass bottle. Lights flicker erratically, casting eerie shadows as screens subtly glitch. The camera sweeps to reveal the bottle is on a vast, empty desk, emphasizing the workers' confinement. A single, giant hand enters the frame, ominously hovering over the bottle.",
