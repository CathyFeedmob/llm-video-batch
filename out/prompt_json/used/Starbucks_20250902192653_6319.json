  "video_prompt": "A modern Starbucks cafe within a glass atrium. Baristas actively prepare drinks behind the counter as patrons slowly approach and settle at various tables, conversing and enjoying their beverages. Sunlight subtly shifts, altering the shadows across the paved outdoor area and illuminating the lush, gently swaying foliage. Individuals ascend and descend the curved white staircase, adding movement to the vibrant, green-toned environment. The scene evolves through the day, reflecting changing light and customer flow.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\nA vibrant, three-tiered, swirling, organic white curvilinear Starbucks cafe building, featuring floor-to-ceiling glass and prominent green Starbucks logos, with visible patrons and baristas inside. It's encased within a massive, light-filled glass atrium with a clean white grid framework, filled with lush greenery including large leafy trees with purple flowering clusters. An outdoor seating area with tables and chairs, a light paved surface with organic shadows, and a curved white staircase are in the foreground. Rendered as a clean, detailed digital illustration with a slightly muted but fresh color palette of greens, whites, and natural wood tones. The scene is bright, modern, and tranquil, bathed in abundant natural light.",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Baristas dynamically craft beverages, hands always in motion. Patrons continually arrive, finding seats, engaging in animated conversations, and sipping drinks with varying expressions. Sunlight gradually shifts, extending and retracting shadows across the outdoor paving, while foliage softly sways. Individuals steadily ascend and descend the staircase. The cafe atmosphere subtly transforms as light patterns evolve and customer activity ebbs and flows throughout the day."
