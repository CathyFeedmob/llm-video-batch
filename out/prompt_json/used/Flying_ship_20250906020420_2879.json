  "video_prompt": "A colossal, ornate ship glides forward, its red and blue hull cutting through swirling purplish-blue cosmic dust. Glowing orange windows illuminate the deck structures as a golden bow emits light, parting ethereal mist. A massive multi-pointed star pulses in a fiery sky, casting a radiant path across a reflecting blue ocean. The ship's dark blue sails unfurl as it sails towards a vibrant, shifting nebula.",

Viewed from above and slightly to the front. The bow emits a golden glow illuminating swirling dark purplish-blue cosmic dust/storm clouds with white and light blue ethereal streaks and scattered bright white dashes. The background features a vibrant gradient sky from deep purple to reddish-orange with a large bright orange nebula on the left, transitioning to warm oranges and pinks suggesting a sunset/sunrise on the right. A brilliant, multi-pointed golden star dominates the upper right, casting a shining path over a calmer blue ocean surface. Visible brushstrokes and rich textures throughout.**",
