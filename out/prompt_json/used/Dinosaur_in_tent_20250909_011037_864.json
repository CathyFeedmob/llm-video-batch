    "video_prompt": "A subtle sway of the tent fabric as if a breeze passes. The dinosaur's eye blinks slowly, and its tongue slightly retracts and extends, with a few drops of drool dripping at a slightly varied pace. Slight ripples appear in the small pool of water in the foreground, and the tall grass blades subtly shift. A very gentle, almost imperceptible zoom out of the camera.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA high-angle, eye-level shot from inside a tent, looking out through an unzipped opening. A large, menacing dinosaur (likely a Tyrannosaurus Rex or similar theropod) with scaly, greenish-blue skin, piercing yellow eyes, and an open mouth full of sharp teeth and a drooling tongue, is positioned prominently in the center-right of the view. The tent flaps frame the scene like a diamond shape, with visible zippers along the edges.\n\nThe setting outside the tent is a vibrant, natural landscape under a bright, clear blue sky. Lush green grass and scattered rocks cover the ground, with small puddles reflecting the sky. Distant trees and possibly a small, distant structure are visible on the horizon. The lighting is bright and natural, indicating daytime, casting subtle shadows on the dinosaur and inside the tent.\n\nThe style is a detailed, painterly illustration with clean linework, reminiscent of graphic novel art or concept art. The colors are rich and vibrant, with a dominant palette of greens, blues, and earthy tones. The atmosphere is suspenseful and tense, creating a sense of imminent danger and surprise. The composition draws the eye directly to the dinosaur, emphasizing its imposing presence.\n\n**Key Visual Elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Large dinosaur (T-Rex type), tent\n*   **Perspective:** High-angle, eye-level from inside the tent\n*   **Dinosaur Details:** Greenish-blue scales, yellow eyes, open mouth, sharp teeth, drooling tongue, visible clawed foot.\n*   **Tent Details:** Unzipped opening, dark green fabric, visible zippers, tent poles/structure.\n*   **Landscape:** Bright blue sky, green grass, rocks, puddles, distant trees/structures.\n\n**Style and Composition:**\n\n*   **Style:** Painterly illustration, graphic novel/concept art aesthetic, clean lines, detailed texturing (scales, fabric).\n*   **Composition:** Diamond-shaped framing from tent opening, dinosaur as central focal point, leading lines from tent zippers.\n\n**Colors, Lighting, and Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Colors:** Vibrant greens (grass, tent), bright blues (sky, dinosaur highlights), earthy browns/greys (rocks, tent), yellow (dinosaur eyes), pink/red (tongue, drool).\n*   **Lighting:** Bright, natural daylight, soft shadows.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Suspenseful, tense, surprising, dangerous.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The tent fabric gently sways. The dinosaur's eye blinks, its tongue subtly extends and retracts, and drool drips unevenly. Ripples appear in the foreground water. Tall grass blades subtly shift. The camera imperceptibly zooms out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Tent violently rips open! The colossal dinosaur lunges, jaws snapping, drool spraying. Its massive eye dilates with predatory fury. The ground shudders as its tail slams down, sending water exploding from the pool. Grass whips wildly in the sudden, powerful gale. The camera jerks back dramatically, revealing the monstrous scale of the attack.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The tent fabric spirals inward, transforming into a kaleidoscope of liquid light. The dinosaur's eye pulsates, emitting vibrant sonic waves that ripple the sky into pure color. Its drool crystallizes mid-air, forming miniature galaxies that orbit its retracting tongue. Water in the foreground defies gravity, forming an inverted waterfall, while grass blades morph into shimmering, sentient vines. The camera unzips the universe, revealing infinite nested realities.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The tent fabric subtly billows, a tension building. A dramatic slow zoom-in on the dinosaur's unblinking, predatory eye as it slowly widens. Its tongue retracts, a guttural growl vibrating the air, causing the tent to shudder. Drool splatters fiercely onto the ground, creating violent ripples in the water. The camera quickly pulls back in a wide, sweeping panic shot, revealing more of the vast, unsettled landscape as the tall grass whips wildly as if something massive is about to emerge.",
