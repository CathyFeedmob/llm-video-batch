    "video_prompt": "Ocean waves subtly crash against the volcanic ash, with shimmering light reflecting off the water's surface. Fine ash particles gently drift from the volcanic smoke plumes. Lava glows softly and subtly flows down the volcano's sides, creating a faint shimmer. Gentle steam rises and dissipates from the water around the lava flow. A very subtle, slow zoom out on the glass, making the scene feel slightly more expansive.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot, miniature volcano erupting inside a clear glass, viewed from the side. The glass is filled with clear, turbulent water, creating ocean-like waves around the volcano. The volcano occupies the bottom half of the glass, its peak just below the water's surface. Intense orange-red lava flows down the dark, textured rock of the volcano, with glowing embers and sparks erupting from the peak, forming a dense white-grey plume of smoke rising vertically into the water. Swirling blue and teal water surrounds the volcano, with frothy white waves crashing against its slopes. The water at the bottom of the glass appears clearer, revealing the base of the volcano and intricate lava flows.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:**\n*   **Full Shot:** The entire glass is visible, top to bottom.\n*   **Eye-Level View:** The perspective is at approximately the middle height of the glass, looking straight in.\n*   **Portrait Orientation:** The image is taller than it is wide.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Glassware:** A perfectly clean, thick-rimmed, cylindrical drinking glass with slight reflections on its surface.\n*   **Volcano:** Dark, craggy, rocky texture; a distinct conical shape creating an island within the glass.\n*   **Lava:** Bright, fiery orange and red, some flowing down the volcano's sides, some as glowing specks.\n*   **Smoke/Ash Plume:** Voluminous, opaque white and light grey, rising directly upwards from the caldera, slightly dissipating as it reaches the surface.\n*   **Water:** Deep, rich blue and teal hues in the main body, transitioning to lighter clear areas towards the top, with turbulent waves.\n*   **Waves:** Dynamic, frothy white crests and sharp, defined ripples on the water's surface, particularly around the volcano and near the glass rim.\n*   **Air Bubbles:** Small, scattered air bubbles visible in the water, especially within the wave crests.\n*   **Floor/Surface:** A light, neutral-toned, slightly textured surface (like concrete or stone) beneath the glass.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Dramatic Lighting:** Strong contrast between the fiery lava and the cool blue water, enhancing the eruption's intensity.\n*   **Internal Glow:** The lava emits a bright, internal glow that illuminates parts of the volcano and the surrounding water.\n*   **Subdued Background:** A soft, out-of-focus grey background, ensuring the glass and its contents are the primary focus.\n*   **Sense of Miniature Power:** The scene conveys a powerful natural event contained within a small, everyday object, creating a surreal and captivating atmosphere.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Hyperrealistic:** Extremely detailed textures for the rock, water, smoke, and lava, with lifelike reflections and refractions in the glass.\n*   **Artistic/Fantasy:** While realistic, the concept itself has a fantastical quality, depicting an impossibly contained natural phenomenon.\n*   **Photographic Quality:** Clean, sharp focus on the subject, with a shallow depth of field blurring the background.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n*   **Dominant Blues & Teals:** For the water.\n*   **Vibrant Oranges & Reds:** For the lava and explosion.\n*   **Dark Greys & Blacks:** For the volcano rock.\n*   **White & Light Grey:** For the smoke/steam and wave foam.\n*   **Neutral Greys/Beiges:** For the background and resting surface.\n\n**Negative Prompts (Optional but helpful):**\n*   blurry, poorly lit, cartoon, painting, drawing, low quality, distorted, unnatural colors, text overlay (unless specified for C29), hands, people, out of focus glass, cloudy water.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtly crashing waves with shimmering reflections. Drifting ash particles from plumes. Softly flowing lava with faint shimmer. Gently rising and dissipating steam. Very subtle, slow zoom out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Volcanic ash violently erupts, launching water and superheated steam skyward! Lava bursts forth, carving fiery paths down the surging waves. The glass shatters outwards, revealing a colossal, erupting ocean volcano. The ocean churns into a furious vortex.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "**Surreal and Impossible Video Prompt:**\n\nVolcanic ash defying gravity, forming inverse craters, while lava flows upwards, solidifying into crystal structures. Time reverses; waves un-crash, revealing an ancient, un-erupted mountain. Steam condenses into shimmering fish, swimming through liquid light. The glass distorts, becoming a sentient, breathing realm, absorbing the impossibilities within.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "An intense, slow-motion shot: **The glass, filled with a furious, miniaturized volcanic eruption, glows ominously. Camera dramatically pushes into the inferno as lava violently explodes upwards, sending shimmering embers scattering. Powerful waves crash against the smoking volcano, creating thick plumes of steam that obscure the scene. The camera rises majestically, revealing the chaos within the confined space.**",
