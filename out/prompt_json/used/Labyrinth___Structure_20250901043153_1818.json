    "video_prompt": "A high-angle, cinematic shot looking down into a vast, multi-layered, Escher-inspired impossible architecture. The complex is a dizzying labyrinth of interconnected concrete platforms and staircases that defy physics, rendered in a monochromatic, sketch-like pen-and-ink style with crisp lines, heavy cross-hatching, and dramatic shadows. Small, indistinct figures are scattered throughout, emphasizing the monumental scale and evoking a sense of confusion, isolation, and unsettling awe.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a concise prompt:\n\n\"M.C. Escher-style impossible architecture: A vast, multi-layered architectural complex viewed from a high-angle, looking down into immense depth. Interconnecting concrete staircases, platforms, and walkways with metal railings defy physics, creating a dizzying, labyrinthine structure. Rendered in a monochromatic sketch style, resembling pen and ink line art with heavy cross-hatching, high contrast, and deep shadows. Textured, weathered concrete surfaces with empty doorways and dark interiors. Includes small, indistinct figures for scale, emphasizing the monumental size. Desolate, mysterious, graphic novel aesthetic.\""
