    "video_prompt": "Ocean waves subtly ripple and crest. The large, vibrant flowers gently sway as if underwater, their delicate petals softly undulate. Small particles drift slowly through the water around the flowers.",
    "image_prompt": "A top-down view of vibrant, alien-like coral anemones or fantastical flowers with petals in shades of deep orange, coral, and purple, some with subtle textures or small spherical protuberances at their tips. Two large compositions dominate the frame, one in the top right and another in the bottom center/right foreground, set against a backdrop of a rugged, dark gray rock cliff face on the left, dotted with patches of smaller, bright purple and orange coral/fungal growth. The rich, deep teal-blue ocean with white foamy waves crashing softly creates a dynamic background on the right. The lighting is bright and clear, highlighting the intricate details and vivid colors of the flora and water. The overall atmosphere is otherworldly and vibrant, emphasizing the fantastical nature of the scene.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Ocean waves subtly ripple and crest. Large, vibrant flowers gently sway, their delicate petals softly undulating. Small particles drift slowly around the flowers.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Ocean violently surges, its waves CRASHING with explosive force. The titanic flowers abruptly erupt from their rocky perches, their tendrils lashing. Petals unfurl with shocking speed, morphing into razor-sharp projectiles. Rocky formations convulse, sending showers of debris into the chaotic sea. Violent torrents of water blast from the flowers, creating churning vortexes.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Ocean waves subtly ripple, **then coalesce into solid crystal, shattering into liquid flowers that bloom in reverse towards the sky.** The large, vibrant flowers gently sway, **their petals phasing through dimensions, revealing skeletal forms before folding into humming star-stuff.** Small particles drift slowly through the water, **each swirling into miniature tornadoes, dissolving into gaseous whispers that reform as glowing, alien script, defying gravity.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic overhead shot swoops down, revealing two bioluminescent \"sea dahlias\" glowing vibrant orange and magenta anchored to a craggy cliff face. The ocean's emerald waves crash and foam below as the camera executes a balletic dive between the blooms, their delicate petals rippling with the currents. Microscopic particles drift like stardust as the scene unfolds, culminating in a sudden, theatrical swell that causes one mighty \"flower\" to gracefully detach and float towards the deep ocean, its tendrils reaching out with an ethereal glow.",
