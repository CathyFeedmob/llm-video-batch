    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A young man and woman sitting across from each other at a small, rectangular wooden table in a cafe, engaged in conversation. Both are smiling and looking at each other, with the man on the left and the woman on the right. Two white coffee cups with latte art are on the table between them, along with an open book or magazine.\n\n**Composition:** Medium close-up, eye-level shot, slightly off-center, drawing the viewer into the personal moment. The couple occupies the middle ground. A red leather booth backrest is visible in the foreground slightly blurring left. The background is dominated by large cafe windows looking out onto a city street.\n\n**Setting:** A cozy, warm-toned cafe with a vintage or classic aesthetic. Large, dark-framed windows with multiple panes. Red leather booth seating. Overhead industrial-style pendant lights with blue shades are visible in the top center.\n\n**Lighting:** Warm, golden hour lighting pouring in from the windows on the left and center. Strong backlight creates bright halos around the couple's heads and a glow on their hair. The light highlights dust particles or rain on the windowpanes, creating a sparkling effect. Interior lighting provides soft fill, preventing harsh shadows. Bokeh effects from distant streetlights and building lights are visible through the windows.\n\n**Colors:** Dominant warm tones: golden yellows, oranges, and deep reds from the booths and streetlights. Contrasting cool tones: blues and teals from the street and reflections in the windows, and the pendant lights. Neutral browns and grays for the window frames, table, and man's jacket. The woman wears an orange knit sweater and black skirt. The man wears a dark denim jacket and a white t-shirt, with blue jeans.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Intimate, warm, inviting, and slightly magical due to the golden light. A feeling of connection and contentment. The rain/dust on the window adds a touch of realism and visual interest.\n\n**Style:** Photorealistic, high-resolution, with a slightly cinematic feel. Shallow depth of field to emphasize the couple, with a pleasing bokeh in the background.\n\n**Details:**\n* Man: Brown hair, clean-shaven, smiling, wearing a dark denim shirt-jacket and white t-shirt.\n* Woman: Long blonde hair, smiling, wearing an orange knitted sweater and a black skirt.\n* Two white coffee cups with latte art.\n* An open book or magazine on the table.\n* Reflections in the window show blurred city lights and building outlines.\n* Rain or dust particles visible on the window glass, catching the light.\n* Dark, sturdy window frames with multiple panes.\n\n**Camera:** Sony Alpha series or similar high-end mirrorless camera with a prime lens (e.g., 50mm f/1.4).\n\n**Mood:** Romantic, cozy, contented.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle steam rising, gentle breath from both subjects, shimmering reflections of flickering streetlights on the window, soft glints accumulating on hair, and the gentle bobbing of external lights.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Violent steam erupts from coffee cups, hot air blasting from subjects' mouths. Streetlights outside shatter and explode, their shattered reflections cascading over the windows. Hair on both subjects ignites with a golden blaze, roaring like a sun. The entire street writhes and contorts, buildings collapsing inward, cars launching skyward. Coffee cups morph into snarling beasts, snapping at the air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Cubes of coffee levitate, assembling into architectural wonders, then melt into shimmering celestial rivers. Hair strands extend, forming impossible Mobius strips that absorb ambient light. Streetlights perform a synchronized ballet, twisting into liquid neon, then solidify into crystalline trees that bloom with light, all defying gravity and logic.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow zoom into the coffee cups\nreveals delicate tendrils of steam, intertwining and dissolving, hinting at the warmth of unspoken connection. Simultaneously, the streetlights and approaching car lights outside intensify, their shimmering reflections dancing on the cafe window, momentarily blinding then softening, as though playing with the scene's emotional tone. A subtle camera roll captures the gentle sway of the room, mirroring the unvoiced sentiments shared between the couple.",
