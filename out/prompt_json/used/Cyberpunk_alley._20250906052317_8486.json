  "video_prompt": "A lone figure with blue hair moves through a densely packed urban alleyway. Screens flicker with abstract patterns and neon lights. Overhead, electric wires and cables crisscross. A distant pink glow pulses from a building. The individual walks away into the depths of the electronic landscape.",
  "image_prompt": "Cyberpunk alleyway, crowded with stacked vintage CRT televisions displaying colorful static, wires, and electronic clutter. Muted teal and desaturated pinkish-orange palette. A person with short blue hair, dark blue hoodie, denim skirt, and backpack walks away into the dense scene. Distant pink glow.  Full shot, retro-futuristic.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "A figure's blue-tinged hair sways with each stride, moving through ever-shifting urban elements. Screens flicker with evolving abstract patterns and shifting neon lights. Overhead cables subtly sway, casting dancing shadows. A distant pink glow pulses rhythmically from a building. The individual continuously walks deeper, the electronic landscape constantly altering and receding around them."
