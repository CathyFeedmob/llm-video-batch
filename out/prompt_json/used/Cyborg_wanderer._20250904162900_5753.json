  "video_prompt": "Human-like automaton or futuristic being slowly turns head, expressive eyes glowing, long dark hair sways. Winds pick up, buffeting cloak with pixelated embellishments. Dust swirls around worn garments and metallic hands. Debris shifts in sand, revealing more wreckage. Distant derelict structure shimmers. Figure slowly walks across rolling sand dunes into the hazy distance, casting elongated shadows.",
  "image_prompt": "A captivating full shot of a human-like automaton in a post-apocalyptic desert. The figure wears a distressed beige hooded cloak with shimmering gold and silver pixelated embellishments, secured by dark leather straps. Its smooth, light-toned face, possibly metallic or porcelain, features glowing eyes and prominent white markings. Numerous layered necklaces adorn its neck, and a dark cuff with gold accents is on its wrist. The vast desert is filled with rolling sand dunes, scattered wreckage, and a derelict structure in the distance. The lighting is soft, suggesting early morning or late afternoon, creating a atmospheric mood.",

Dust swirls around the figure's garments and metallic hands. Debris shifts in the sand, uncovering more wreckage. A distant, derelict structure shimmers. The figure then walks across rolling dunes, moving into a hazy distance, casting elongated, stretching shadows."
