  "image_prompt": "Full shot of a young woman with chin-length black hair and red eyes, low squatting and centered. She wears a light gray top, dark skirt/shorts, and dark boots, with a gold ring on her right ring finger. Her hands hold a red katana vertically in front of her, the red blade with a black-wrapped hilt and bronze tsuba visible. The background is a textured, weathered wall with abstract red markings and faded white/black elements, including a question mark shape. White Japanese characters are in the bottom left, and a white signature is in the bottom right. Soft, direct lighting.",
