    "video_prompt": "Subtle light flickering on neon signs and building windows. Gentle sway of flying vehicles as they slowly drift. Slight steam or haze rising between tall buildings, creating depth. Occasional, soft reflections of city lights on the wet road surface. Minimal camera pan to reveal more of the cityscape.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image, focusing on its visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Core Prompt:**\n\n\"A highly detailed, futuristic city scene, inspired by cyberpunk and sci-fi aesthetics but with a modern, clean render. The perspective is a dynamic low-angle wide shot looking down a bustling main street, flanked by towering skyscrapers that stretch endlessly into a hazy, cloudy sky.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:**\n\nA deep, converging perspective drawing the eye towards the vanishing point at the horizon. The dominant elements are the numerous, irregularly shaped, ultra-tall skyscrapers, some with intricate spires, creating a canyon-like urban landscape. Elevated walkways and bridges link these high-rises at various levels, suggesting a multi-layered transportation system. In the foreground, a vibrant street level scene unfolds, with pedestrian sidewalks and a wet road reflecting the city lights.\n\n**Atmosphere & Lighting:**\n\nThe overall atmosphere is a blend of futuristic vibrancy and slight melancholic haze. The sky is overcast with soft, diffused clouds, suggesting either twilight or a perpetually cloudy advanced urban environment. Cool, ambient lighting dominates, emanating from countless glowing windows, neon signs, and futuristic vehicle lights. The reflections on the wet street create dramatic streaks of light and color, adding depth and dynamism.\n\n**Colors:**\n\nA rich palette of blues, purples, and electric pinks from the neon signs and illuminated buildings. These are contrasted with the warm glows of interior lights (yellows, oranges) from the skyscrapers and the bright headlights/taillights of passing vehicles. The dominant colors of the flying and ground cars are vibrant yellows, blues, and reds. The clouds are soft greys and whites.\n\n**Visual Elements (Specifics):**\n\n*   **Buildings:** A mix of sleek, glass-and-steel skyscrapers. Some feature glowing vertical light strips, others have multiple evenly spaced windows. Several buildings have prominent neon signs in various languages. Tall, gothic-inspired spires on some distant skyscrapers.\n*   **Vehicles (Air):** Numerous levitating vehicles of various designs. Large, yellow, taxi-like 'flying cars' that are long and rectangular with blue underglow, appearing as if on invisible tracks or magnetic levitation. Smaller, sleek, alien-like aircraft in red, blue, and black, resembling futuristic jets or drones, flying freely between buildings at mid-levels.\n*   **Vehicles (Ground):** Modern-day cars, including yellow taxis, a blue sedan, and a red sedan, driving on a wet, reflective street. Their headlights and taillights create distinct light trails.\n*   **Street Level:**\n    *   **Pedestrians:** Large crowds of people walking on the sidewalks, their forms somewhat silhouetted against the bright city lights, adding a sense of scale and life.\n    *   **Neon Signs & Billboards:** Abundant, brightly lit electronic billboards and vertical neon signs displaying abstract patterns, futuristic text, and animations in vibrant blues, yellows, oranges, and pinks. These are positioned on the lower levels of the buildings, illuminating the street.\n    *   **Street Lights & Traffic Lights:** Traditional black lampposts with traffic lights, adding a familiar touch to the futuristic setting.\n*   **Details:** Visible structural details on the elevated walkways/bridges. Subtle glow around the levitating vehicles indicating their propulsion. Reflections of the entire city on the wet ground.\n*   **Branding/Overlay:** A subtle \"c29\" logo in the bottom right corner (if allowed by tool).\n\n**Style & Render:**\n\nPhotorealistic rendering with a slightly stylized, almost painterly depth in the hazier distant elements. Sharp focus on foreground elements, gradually softening towards the background. High contrast between illuminated areas and shadows, creating dramatic urban textures.\n\n**Artistic Directives:**\n\n\"Cinematic, epic, grand, futuristic, sprawling, dense, bustling, dynamic, high-detail, urban sprawl, neo-futurism.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here's a refined prompt focusing *exclusively* on motion, changes, and expression, as requested:\n\n**Subtle light dance across surfaces. Gentle, deliberate drift and sway. Soft, transient wisps ascend, defining space. Fleeting gleams streak the ground. Slow, organic reveal of the sprawling vista.**",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive light bursts from neon signs, illuminating windows. Flying vehicles dart and weave erratically, crashing into buildings. Skyscrapers buckle and twist violently. Fire erupts and dances wildly, propelled by unseen forces. Streets crack and heave, cars flipping and tumbling. Sudden, disorienting camera jolts and rapid pans reveal a city in chaos.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Neon signs ooze liquid light onto the impossibly wet road, shimmering upwards into buildings. Flying cars gracefully disassemble mid-air, their parts reassembling into schools of bioluminescent fish that swim through the haze, eventually reforming into the original vehicles. The cityscape gently inhales and exhales, distorting and re-aligning itself with each breath. Shadows detach and dance in complex fractals across the impossibly tall structures.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "DRAMATIC PUSH-IN on illuminated windows, revealing subtle interior movements. SWEEPING CRANE SHOT as a taxi-drone drifts down, then a sudden camera DROP to street level. LOW-ANGLE TRACKING SHOT past pedestrians, catching the shimmering reflections on the wet asphalt, as terrestrial taxis glide silently. The camera SLOWLY TILTS UP, revealing the haze-shrouded, towering city.",
