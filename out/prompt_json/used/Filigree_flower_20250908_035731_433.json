    "video_prompt": "The petals gently sway and ripple as if a soft breeze passes, with subtle shifts in translucency and color. The gilded edges shimmer, and the fine filaments within the petals delicately move, creating a soft, ethereal quality. A subtle, dreamlike bokeh effect appears and disappears in the background, resembling sparkling dust or light passing through foliage. The central stamens subtly vibrate, catching and reflecting light.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA stunning close-up of an artificial or sculpted flower, resembling a peony, crafted from delicate, translucent, and multi-colored material, possibly wired organza or painted silk, with a distinct fibrous texture. The petals feature a gradient of soft, pastel colors: light blue, white, pale yellow transitioning to deeper gold in the center, light pink, and lavender to violet, creating a rainbow-like effect. Each petal is outlined with a thin, shimmering gold border, suggesting wire or metallic paint. The center of the flower is filled with numerous tiny, delicate golden-wire stamens that radiate outwards. Below the main bloom, a few realistic, yet stylized, leaves cascade downwards, also outlined in gold and colored in vibrant shades of green and teal. The stem is thin, golden, and metallic. The background is a soft, light gray with subtle, out-of-focus bokeh lights in various soft, bright, and pastel hues (pink, purple, blue, yellow) creating a dreamy, magical atmosphere. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the translucency and intricate details of the flower. The composition is a close-up, slightly off-center, vertical shot, filling most of the frame, with the flower angled slightly to the right. The overall aesthetic is elegant, delicate, and ethereal, with a touch of luxury.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Petals sway and ripple, subtly changing translucency and color. Gilded edges shimmer; fine filaments delicately move. A dreamlike bokeh appears and disappears in the background, like sparkling dust. Central stamens subtly vibrate, catching light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Electrified filaments explode outwards, petals violently ripple and crash, tearing gilded edges with impossible speed. The central stamens lash like whip-cracked gold, flinging shards of light. The background erupts with a vortex of intensely pulsing, chromatic bokeh, devouring and disgorging light. This floral entity convulses, an explosive botanical force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The iridescent petals flow like water, bleeding colors as they undulate against impossible currents. The gilded edges liquify and reform, melting into the air then solidifying into shimmering dust motes that float upwards. The central filaments coil and unfurl, creating impossible geometric patterns, while the background bokeh morphs into celestial bodies that orbit the flower. This ethereal bloom pulses with an otherworldly energy, defying all laws of physics.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly pushes forward, light catching the exquisite golden edges of the translucent petals. A subtle breeze begins, causing the flower to shimmer and sway with increasing intensity, petals rippling hypnotically. The background bokeh intensifies, swirling like a dream. A soft light pulsates from the flowerâ€™s core, building to a dramatic bloom before gently fading.",
