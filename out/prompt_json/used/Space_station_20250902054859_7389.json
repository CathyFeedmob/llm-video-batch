  "video_prompt": "A colossal, dark space station pulses with electric blue energy lines. Its central blue reactor core intensifies as jagged white lightning bolts crisscross from its upper sections, illuminating the surrounding space. Numerous spacecraft, with glowing orange thrusters, fly in various directions: elongated ships ascend, sleek vessels sweep past, large transports move slowly, and smaller ships dart in the background. Stars twinkle faintly. Subtle atmospheric glows shift on a curved planet horizon. The camera slowly pans up and forward, observing the dynamic activity.",
  "image_prompt": "A breathtaking, highly detailed, futuristic space scene. A colossal, multi-tiered orbital city dominates the center, constructed from intricate dark metallic structures, glowing with electric blue lines, panels, and a prominent circular blue reactor core at its base. Jagged bolts of brilliant white lightning-like energy crisscross from its upper sections. A myriad of diverse spacecraft, including sleek fighters and large transports with glowing orange thrusters, populate the cosmic canvas, flying in various directions. In the background, the curved horizon of a planet with soft blue and white atmospheric glow, under a dark sky with faint twinkling stars. Dynamic low-angle perspective. The scene is rich with dark blues, greys, and blacks, accentuated by vibrant electric blues, bright whites, and warm orange/reds, creating an epic vision of advanced technology and dynamic energy.",
