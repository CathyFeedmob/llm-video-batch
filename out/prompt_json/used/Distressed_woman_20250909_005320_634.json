    "video_prompt": "Subtle eye blinking, tear rolling down face, slight tremor in the hands, gentle hair swaying, subtle rise and fall of the chest from breathing, shimmering light reflected on the necklace, cans subtly shifting, liquid glistening on the ground.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, broken down by visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere, designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n*   **Subject:** A young woman with long, flowing blonde hair, fair skin, and delicate features. She is depicted from the upper torso up, head tilted back, eyes mostly closed with a tear stained eye. Her mouth is slightly open. She wears a white thin-strapped dress or camisole.\n*   **Facial Details:** Her left eye has a distinct emerald green iris. A single, distinct red tear or streak of blood originates from the inner corner of this eye, tracing down her cheek. Her right earlobe has a small drip of blood or liquid, potentially indicating a recent wound or pierce (from which a tear might also be falling).\n*   **Surroundings:** She is lying against or slumped over a grey/blue concrete and metal barrier (potentially a highway barrier or bridge railing). Below her, on a dark, wet-looking surface, are numerous discarded beverage containers: at least one green glass beer bottle, several green aluminum cans (some open, some closed, some overturned), and at least one red aluminum can.\n*   **Symbolism/Details:** There are splatters and smears of red liquid (blood or dark liquid) on the white barrier, on her white dress, and on the ground near the cans, adding to the grim narrative. The brand \"SEINGRA\" is faintly visible on one green can. The top left corner has \"AI 生成\" text. The bottom right corner has \"c:29\" text.\n\n**Style:**\n\n*   **Artistic Style:** Anime/Manga inspired, with soft, rendered details and a somewhat ethereal quality, yet grounded in realism for the details of blood and debris. Highly detailed expressive eyes and delicate facial features.\n*   **Rendering:** Smooth gradients, soft shading, and delicate line work. Textural elements are subtly rendered, like hair strands and the reflective quality of the cans.\n\n**Composition:**\n\n*   **Angle:** Low-angle shot, looking up at the woman, emphasizing her vulnerable or distraught state.\n*   **Framing:** Vertical aspect ratio, typical of a phone wallpaper. The woman's head and upper body occupy the upper-middle to left-middle of the frame. The cans and bottles are in the foreground, out of sharp focus, creating depth.\n*   **Focus:** Sharp focus on the woman's face and upper body. The background and extreme foreground elements are subtly blurred to draw attention to the subject.\n*   **Balance:** The image is slightly off-center, with the woman positioned to the left, and the cans balancing the bottom right.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   **Palette:** Dominantly cool tones (greys, blues, dark greens) contrasted with warm highlights on the woman's skin and hair.\n*   **Key Colors:**\n    *   Skin: Pale, light peach/pink.\n    *   Hair: Golden blonde.\n    *   Eyes: Emerald green.\n    *   Blood/Liquid: Vivid red.\n    *   Dress: Stark white.\n    *   Barrier: Grey-blue.\n    *   Cans: Green, red, silver.\n    *   Background: Dark, muted greys and blacks.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n*   **Source:** Off-camera, suggesting an artificial light source (like a streetlamp or vehicle lights) from the right and slightly above, casting soft highlights on her face, neck, and hair.\n*   **Direction:** Creates gentle shadows that sculpt her features.\n*   **Overall:** Fairly dark and moody, with pockets of brighter light highlighting key elements.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Mood:** Melancholic, tragic, despairing, possibly indicating a struggle or accident. There is a sense of isolation and vulnerability.\n*   **Emotional Tone:** Intense and dramatic, conveying deep sadness or pain.\n\n**Concise Prompt (combining elements):**\n\n\"A full-body shot of a distraught young anime woman with long blonde hair, pale skin, and emerald green eyes, lying collapsed against a grey concrete barrier in a gloomy, dark environment. A red tear/blood streak runs from her left eye down her cheek, and a small drop of blood is by her right ear. She wears a white thin-strap dress stained with red liquid. Her head is tilted back, mouth slightly agape in anguish, eyes semi-closed. In the blurred foreground, on a dark, wet ground, are scattered alcoholic beverage containers: green glass beer bottles, overturned and upright green and red aluminum cans, some with red liquid stains. The scene is lit by soft, dramatic artificial light from the right, highlighting her face and hair. The composition is a low-angle, vertical shot, deeply sorrowful and isolated. Anime style, soft rendering, detailed expressive eyes.\"",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle blinks, a tear's slow descent, trembling hands. Hair gently sways. A chest subtly rises and falls, necklace glints. Cans imperceptibly shift as liquid glistens on the ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Eyes explosively open, tears gush down, hands violently clench, hair whips wildly, chest heaves with gasps. Necklace flares with blinding light, cans erupt, shattering glass, liquids surge upwards. The guard rail twists and buckles. Everything vibrates with unleashed, chaotic energy.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Tears of emerald light trace alien symbols up her face, defying gravity. Her hands, inverted, ripple like water, shifting metallic cans into iridescent butterflies that flutter upward. Hair, liquid platinum, flows into an impossibly vast void, revealing stars. Her chest expands to encompass the universe, then contracts to a single point. Liquid pools on the ground, reflecting not a scene, but a kaleidoscope of impossible dimensions.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, cinematic zoom-in on her face, revealing a single, bloody tear tracing her cheek. A subtle quiver in her chin shows true despair. The camera then smoothly pans down to reveal her hand, trembling and clenched, near fallen beer cans. A faint pool of liquid on the ground glistens under the harsh light, catching the eye as it subtly expands, hinting at a prolonged, desperate moment.",
