    "video_prompt": "Subtle pulsing red glow from the central chest light and internal machinery, faint glinting off metallic surfaces, and a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom in.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed AI image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot of a futuristic, anthropomorphic robot egg. The robot egg is predominantly black and gold, with striking red neon lights integrated into its armor. The egg itself is a light brown, with subtle crackle textures visible on its surface, hinting at a delicate core beneath its robust shell.\n\nThe design is highly detailed, featuring intricate mechanical components, visible bolts, vents, and glowing red circular elements on its chest and arm. The robot has strong, multi-jointed legs and arms, ending in articulated, claw-like hands. Its posture is sturdy and grounded.\n\nIt stands on a dark, circular, futuristic platform with concentric glowing red rings and metallic textures, suggesting a charging station or display stand. The background is a minimalist, light gray, slightly textured concrete wall, providing a clean contrast that emphasizes the robot.\n\n**Style:** Sci-fi, Mecha, Industrial Design, Cyberpunk elements.\n**Composition:** Centered, eye-level shot, emphasizing the robot's form and details.\n**Lighting:** Dramatic and cinematic, with strong internal red glows from the neon lights illuminating parts of the robot's exterior and casting subtle reflections. Overall soft, even studio lighting from above, highlighting metallic sheen and textures.\n**Colors:** Dominant black, gold, and red. Subtle light brown for the egg. Muted gray background.\n**Atmosphere:** High-tech, powerful, slightly mysterious, cutting-edge.\n**Aspect Ratio:** Vertical (portrait).\n\n**Consideration for AI:**\n* Emphasize the materials: polished black armor, brushed gold accents, cracked eggshell texture.\n* Ensure the glowing red elements look integrated and not just superimposed.\n* The \"C29\" watermark should be omitted unless specifically requested as a separate element.\n* The \"AI生成\" text on the top left should be omitted.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The chest light subtly pulses red, and internal mechanisms gently articulate. Metallic surfaces sporadically gleam. A very gradual, almost imperceptible zoom-in reveals the figure expanding slightly within the frame.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "CRACK! The egg-robot's shell explodes open, revealing pulsing red energy within. Metallic limbs snap into aggressive positions, joints hissing steam. The central chest light flares, throwing sharp, strobing red beams, as the robot LEAPS at the viewer, the platform beneath it SHATTERING with each impact. Rapid, violent camera shake intensifies the sudden, terrifying attack.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The egg-bot's cracked shell subtly reseals itself, then slowly unravels into shimmering liquid gold that drips upwards, reforming into ethereal, pulsating butterflies. Its glowing red core spirals outwards, creating a singularity that pulls the entire scene into an impossible, kaleidoscopic vortex, before morphing into a cosmic eye that blinks, restarting the impossible loop.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, tense zoom-in reveals the ominous red glow from the egg-robot's chest, casting deep shadows across its cracked shell. As the camera subtly swivels, metallic surfaces catch the light with a brief, sinister glint. A low hum builds as steam vents from hidden joints. The ground beneath it pulsates with internal energy, causing a faint tremble that culminates in a sudden, dramatic lurch forward, its clawed hands twitching with unsettling readiness.",
