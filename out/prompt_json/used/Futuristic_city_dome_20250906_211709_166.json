  "video_prompt": "Subtle shimmering of stars within the large sphere, gentle wisps of clouds drifting past the upper structures, a soft glint of light shifting across the golden domes and white facades, and a very slow, almost imperceptible outward zoom of the camera.",
  "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA breath-taking aerial view of an ethereal, futuristic city nested within fluffy white clouds. The city features Baroque and neo-classical architecture, with buildings primarily in pristine white marble, adorned with intricate gold details on domes, spires, and archways. Abundant lush green foliage and small trees are integrated into the architecture on rooftops and balconies.\n\nA massive, transparent glass dome dominates the right side of the composition, reflecting a vibrant, cosmic sky filled with sparkling stars, nebulae, and distant galaxies. The dome's surface subtly distorts the reflections, adding to its grand scale. The city's structure forms a sweeping curve around the dome, creating a sense of a vast, futuristic arcology. Architectural elements like grand staircases, terraced gardens, and ornate bridges connect different sections of the city.\n\nThe lighting is bright and celestial, with a soft, diffused glow illuminating the city. The atmosphere is one of serene grandeur and advanced civilization, evoking a feeling of wonder and aspirational fantasy. The perspective is high-angle, looking down onto the complex, emphasizing its immense scale and intricate details.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Refinement:\n\nSubtle stellar shimmer within the sphere. Wisps of clouds drift past upper structures. A soft glint moves across golden domes and white facades. Imperceptible outward camera zoom.",
  "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Violent tremors shake the colossal sphere, stars inside erupting into blinding supernova flares.** White facades crack and splinter as golden domes violently rotate, spewing incandescent light. Clouds above churn into a furious vortex, tearing through the upper structures. The entire city twists and contorts, buildings collapsing and reforming in a chaotic ballet of destruction and creation. The camera performs a heart-stopping, dizzying plunge towards the sphere's tumultuous core, then an immediate, impossible zoom back to a panoramic, explosive unraveling perspective.",
  "creative_video_prompt_2": "Impossible prompt:\n\nThe cosmic sphere's stars swirl inward, consuming scattered fragments of the city's golden domes, which then stretch and liquify into ethereal spires that pierce through inverted clouds. Facades bleed into the sky, forming shimmering rivers of light that flow upwards, merging into the dome that now rotates on a non-existent axis, pulling distant galaxies within its impossible gravitational pull. A reverse waterfall of stardust cascades from the dome's base, gently lifting the entire structure into a dissolving dreamscape.",
  "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow crane shot reveals the ethereal city emerging from clouds. The camera then gracefully arcs around the vast, star-filled sphere, the subtle shimmer of stars within momentarily intensifying. As it completes the orbit, a dramatic, swift zoom focuses on a glinting golden dome, followed by a gentle, continuous outward creep, revealing the city's scale against the celestial sphere."
