    "video_prompt": "The character blinks subtly. Her long white hair gently sways as if from a light draft. The iridescent glow on her jacket and the cat ears slightly ripple and shift color. The computer screen directly in front of her has very subtle, dynamic information subtly changing, and the screen to her right emanates a faint, pulsating pink light. The light from the keyboard under her hands exhibits a soft, rhythmic glow. A barely perceptible breath causes her chest to rise and fall.",
    "image_prompt": "An anime-style digital painting of a female character with long, straight white hair and bright blue eyes with pink irises, wearing large black headphones with glowing blue accents and luminous cat ears. She is dressed in a shiny, dark blue and black techwear jacket with glowing light blue details and what appear to be functional buckles and straps. The jacket also features a blue square patch on the left arm with a stylized \"R\" or infinity symbol.\n\nShe is seated in a black gaming chair with a high back, her left hand resting gently against her chin, and her right hand positioned over a light-colored mechanical keyboard with glowing blue and pink keys. The background shows a dimly lit room with two large computer monitors. The monitor on the left displays blue holographic interfaces with a target reticle, while the monitor on the right shows pink holographic displays, suggesting a futuristic or cyberpunk setting. The overall lighting is dim, emphasizing the glowing elements on her headphones, ears, jacket, and the screens, creating a cool, neon-lit atmosphere. The art style features sharp lines, smooth shading, and a distinct anime aesthetic, with an emphasis on luminous details and vibrant contrasts of blue, pink, and white against a dark background. The composition is a medium shot, focusing on her upper body and the surrounding tech setup.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "**Refined Video Prompt:**\n\nSubtle blinks. Hair sways gently. Iridescent jacket and cat ears ripple and shift color. Front screen information subtly changes dynamically. Right screen pulsates faintly pink. Keyboard light glows rhythmically. Chest rises and falls with a barely perceptible breath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The character's eyes snap open, pulsating with raw energy. Her white hair explodes outwards in a shockwave, shimmering like liquid light. The iridescent glow on her jacket bursts into vibrant, kaleidoscopic waves, devouring her cat ears that shatter into a cascade of glowing fragments. Both computer screens crackle with chaotic, blinding light, one spewing out torrents of data while the other erupts in blinding pink lightning. The keyboard launches into the air, its keys glowing fiercely and scattering like explosive embers. Her chest heaves violently, propelled by an unseen force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Her eyes become cosmic whirlpools, hair transforms into flowing starlight, defying gravity. The jacket's iridescence shatters into fractals of light, reforming continuously. Cat ears dissolve into shimmering auroras, then solidify into crystal. Both screens warp and breathe, colors bleeding into impossible spectrums. The keyboard keys melt into a liquid rainbow, then solidify, re-shaping into alien symbols. Her chest expands into a nebula, contracting into a single star.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow cinematic zoom-in on her eyes as she blinks, capturing the subtle ripple of the iridescent jacket and cat ears in perfect sync. The camera then smoothly pans to the right, following the shifting pink light on the second monitor. A dramatic close-up on her hands as the keyboard's rhythmic glow intensifies slightly, her fingers subtly adjusting. The final shot is an elegant, sweeping arc, revealing her chest's gentle rise and fall, culminating in a soft fade to black.",
