    "video_prompt": "Subtle atmospheric haze shifts and city lights gently twinkle. Distant vehicle lights subtly drift across the roads. The sun slowly descends, dimming the sky, while the reflection of the sunset on building windows subtly pulses. Fabric of the person's clothing very gently billows.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"First-person perspective of someone sitting on the edge of a very tall skyscraper, dangling their legs over the edge. The view looks down over a sprawling, futuristic metropolis at sunset. The sky is a vibrant gradient of warm oranges, fiery reds, and soft yellows, with a slightly hazy, atmospheric perspective. A distinct, slightly diffused setting sun is visible near the horizon. Tall, complex architectural buildings dominate the foreground and midground, with many windows lit from within, casting warm glows and reflections. Some buildings are sleek and modern, others appear more weathered or industrial, showcasing diverse urban textures. The city below is illuminated by countless artificial lights, creating a sparkling, almost grid-like pattern. The overall atmosphere is a mix of awe, serenity, and a touch of daring or solitude. The person's worn, textured boots and the lower part of their pants are visible in the immediate foreground, adding to the immersive, first-person feel. The digital art style emphasizes realistic textures and light, with a slightly gritty, cinematic quality. Subtle volumetric fog or haze contributes to the depth and glow of the sunset.\"\n\n**Breakdown of key elements for the AI:**\n\n*   **Viewpoint/Composition:** \"First-person perspective,\" \"sitting on the edge of a very tall skyscraper, dangling their legs over the edge,\" \"view looks down,\" \"lower part of their pants are visible in the immediate foreground.\"\n*   **Setting:** \"Sprawling, futuristic metropolis,\" \"tall, complex architectural buildings,\" \"city below.\"\n*   **Time of Day/Lighting:** \"Sunset,\" \"vibrant gradient of warm oranges, fiery reds, and soft yellows,\" \"slightly hazy, atmospheric perspective,\" \"distinct, slightly diffused setting sun,\" \"many windows lit from within, casting warm glows and reflections,\" \"countless artificial lights, creating a sparkling, almost grid-like pattern.\"\n*   **Atmosphere/Mood:** \"Awe, serenity, and a touch of daring or solitude,\" \"immersive, first-person feel.\"\n*   **Style:** \"Digital art style,\" \"realistic textures and light,\" \"slightly gritty, cinematic quality,\" \"Subtle volumetric fog or haze.\"\n*   **Specific Details:** \"Worn, textured boots.\"",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings violently sway as the sun detonates, scattering brilliant light across the sky. Distant vehicles explode. The person's clothing tears, revealing swirling energy beneath. Ground beneath the person cracks and crumbles, revealing an abyss. The entire city twists and buckles. Shadows writhe.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The city's light whispers, swirling upwards to the sun, which expands into a black hole before collapsing into a fractal butterfly. Buildings ripple like water, their windows mirroring impossible geometries of other dimensions. The person's clothes become a shimmering vortex, pulling them into the sky, their body fracturing into starlight. Gravity folds inward, creating impossible reflections of alternate realities dancing across the cityscape.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A figure sits precariously on a skyscraper ledge as a dramatic sunset bleeds across the cityscape. The camera ascends into a wide shot, revealing the sprawling urban expanse. The sun's reflection on distant buildings intensifies, casting an orange glow. Suddenly, the figure leans forward, their boots hovering over the dizzying drop. The camera rapidly tilts down, capturing the extreme height, then whips back up to the figure's face, now hardened with resolve.",
