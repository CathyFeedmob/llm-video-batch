    "video_prompt": "Glowing particles emanate from the train and track, drifting upwards and outwards. The train's wireframe subtly pulsates with a soft, internal glow. The distant stars twinkle faintly. The light beam extending from the train's top gently shimmers. A subtle, slow zoom out reveals more of the starry expanse.",
    "image_prompt": "A high-angle, eye-level shot looking down a sleek modern high-speed bullet train, rendered in a striking wireframe style, glowing with vibrant cyan electric lines, against a dark, starry night sky. The train's detailed wireframe design extends along its entire visible length, slightly tapering towards the back, with individual windows and structural elements visible. Bright cyan light emanates from beneath the train, illuminating the railway tracks below, which blur motionally into the distance, conveying speed. A bright, focused beam of cyan light shoots upwards from the top of the train into the dark sky, suggesting propulsion or energy. The overall atmosphere is futuristic and dynamic, with subtle light specks in the background enhancing the sense of a vast, open space. A legible signature \"c29\" in glowing cyan is positioned in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Art styles**: Wireframe, Digital Art, Futuristic, Neon, Motion Blur\n**Shot type**: High-angle, Eye-level, Full shot (of the train)\n**Composition**: Symmetrical, leading lines (train and tracks), strong vertical and diagonal elements.\n**Lighting**: Glowing electric cyan lines, strong emission from the train, high contrast with dark background.\n**Colors**: Predominantly black and dark blue tones for the sky, vibrant cyan for the train and light emissions.\n**Atmosphere**: Futuristic, energetic, fast-paced, ethereal.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Glowing particles drift up and out from the train and tracks. The train's wireframe softly pulsates. Distant stars faintly twinkle. The light beam atop the train gently shimmers. A subtle, slow zoom out reveals more of the starry expanse.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The train's wireframe violently convulses, lines ripping apart then fusing with blinding flashes. The track explodes with erupting light, sending luminous particles hurtling skyward like a supernova. Distant stars suddenly plunge, streaking past the hurtling train as if chasing it through collapsing space. The light beam atop the train whips into a chaotic vortex, consuming all in its path. A sudden, violent jolt throws the viewer backwards into the swirling void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The wireframe train, a luminous serpent of light, swims through a cosmic ocean. Track sections spontaneously levitate and reassemble mid-air before dissolving into nebulae. Dispersed stardust coalesces into miniature galaxies within the trainâ€™s hollow core, then explodes outwards into bioluminescent tendrils, intertwining with inverted rain. The top beam blossoms into a shimmering vortex, pulling distant constellations into its impossible depths.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A slow, dramatic zoom out reveals a digital wireframe train, its glowing azure lines pulsating gently. As the camera pulls back, particles emanate from the train and track, drifting like cosmic dust toward the twinkling expanse of stars. A powerful light beam from the train's top shimmers, reaching endlessly into the deep space. The camera continues its slow retreat, revealing the boundless, star-dusted void.",
