    "video_prompt": "From a low angle, a woman with a long blonde braid, dressed in a black flowing gown, stands on a rooftop at night. Her head is tilted slightly forward, gazing down at the glowing sword she holds in her hands.\n\nThe primary subtle movements to animate this image would be:\n\n- **Hair:** Gentle swaying of the long blonde braid from side to side and small strands of hair around her face fluttering in a faint breeze.\n- **Fabric:** The black gown subtly rippling and folding with the same gentle breeze, particularly the lower half of the dress and the back where it appears to be flowing.\n- **Light:** The bright glow of the sword should pulse softly, and the light reflections on the blade should shimmer slightly. Small, faint glints of light should occasionally appear on the sword's surface. The distant lights from the buildings should also have a very subtle, almost imperceptible flicker.\n- **Particle Effects:** A few tiny, faint sparkles originating from the sword's glow could drift upwards and disappear.\n- **Background:** The stars in the dark sky should twinkle very slightly.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot of a slender young woman with long, braided blonde hair, tied high in a ponytail, looking down with a contemplative expression. She wears a dark, backless gown with intricate strap details and gold accents, flowing naturally. She firmly grasps a long, gleaming silver sword with a distinct gold hilt, the blade angled downwards, radiating bright, sharp light reflections. The scene is set on a rooftop overlooking a city at night, with slightly visible, dimly lit buildings and skyscrapers in the background. The sky is a deep, dark blue, scattered with subtle, sparkling stars. The art style is a blend of detailed anime character design with a painterly, watercolor texture, especially noticeable in the background and dress, giving it a slightly gritty yet luminous feel. Strong dramatic lighting on the sword and parts of her body. The overall atmosphere is melancholic and powerful.\n\n**Key elements broken down for clarity:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Young woman, slender build.\n*   **Hair:** Long, braided, bright blonde, high ponytail.\n*   **Face/Expression:** Looking down, contemplative, soft facial features.\n*   **Clothing:** Dark, backless gown, intricate straps, gold accents, flowing fabric.\n*   **Item:** Long, gleaming silver sword with gold hilt, firmly held, angled downwards.\n*   **Lighting on Item:** Bright, sharp light reflections/glow emanating from the sword.\n*   **Composition:** Full body shot, standing on a rooftop.\n*   **Background:** City skyline at night, dimly lit buildings/skyscrapers.\n*   **Sky:** Deep dark blue, scattered with subtle, sparkling stars.\n*   **Art Style:** Blend of detailed anime/manga character illustration with a painterly, watercolor texture (especially background and dress).

    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle movements: Blonde braid sways gently. Black gown softly ripples and folds, especially the lower half. Glowing sword pulses softly; reflections shimmer, faint glints appear. Distant city lights flicker imperceptibly. Tiny sparkles drift from the sword. Stars faintly twinkle.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The woman's braided hair whips violently around her. Her flowing gown rips, revealing crackling arcane energy beneath. The sword pulses with blinding, explosive light, shattering the rooftop beneath her. Buildings in the background convulse and crumble, their lights flickering erratically before exploding into dust. Debris and sparks erupt upwards from the collapsing city as she raises the sword, defying gravity.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "From a low angle, a woman with a long blonde braid, dressed in a black flowing gown, stands on a rooftop at night. Her head is tilted slightly forward, gazing down at the glowing sword she holds in her hands.\n\nThe primary fantastical movements to animate this image would be:\n\n- **Hair:** The braid continuously unwinds and rewinds, transforming into a flowing waterfall of starlight.\n- **Fabric:** The gown ripples and unfurls into celestial nebulae, revealing glimpses of distant galaxies within its folds.\n- **Light:** The sword's glow pulsates, reshaping the surrounding buildings into shimmering crystalline structures that then dissolve into cosmic dust.\n- **Particle Effects:** Sparkles from the sword coalesce into miniature constellations that float upwards, then reform into the hilt.\n- **Background:** The night sky warps into a kaleidoscopic vortex, drawing the buildings and the woman towards a singular point of light.",

Her head is tilted slightly forward, gazing down at the glowing sword she holds in her hands.\n\nThe camera, positioned low, slowly tracks forward, pushing past subtle shifts in her long blonde braid and the gentle ripple of her gown, toward the captivating, softly pulsing glow of the sword. As the sword's light subtly intensifies, tiny sparks float upwards, while the distant city lights flicker with a soft rhythm. Her eyes, filled with a subtle, internal struggle, briefly glance up, then back to the blade, mirroring the dramatic shift in light intensity as the glow of the sword pulses.",
