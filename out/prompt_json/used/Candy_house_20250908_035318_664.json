    "video_prompt": "Gentle shimmer and sparkle across the sugary surface of the candy house and surrounding treats. Very subtle swaying of the lollipop sticks as if a light breeze is passing. Light reflections softly shift on the jelly candy surfaces. The tiny candy sprinkles on the ground appear to have a very faint, almost imperceptible undulation.",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical sugar candy house, crafted from colorful, sugar-dusted gumdrop blocks, with white frosting accents outlining the roof, windows, and door frames, and a red front door. The house stands in a vibrant landscape made of green, sugar-sprinkled turf and a pink, sugar-bead path leading to the door, flanked by white candy stairs. The scene is filled with various candies, including green gumdrop trees with white speckles, red, yellow, and blue gumdrops scattered around, swirled lollipops on sticks, and flat colorful candy disks along the path. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the sugary textures and vivid colors, creating a playful and inviting atmosphere, like a sugary wonderland. A hint of green and yellow gumdrop hills are blurred in the background.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle shimmer and sparkle animate the candy house and treats. Lollipop sticks gently sway. Light reflects softly on jelly candies. Ground sprinkles undulate faintly.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The candy house shudders, jelly walls vibrating intensely as the roof dramatically shatters outwards, showering glistening sugar shards. Lollipop sticks whip violently around, creating miniature sugar tornadoes. Jelly candies explode, releasing bursts of sugary mist. The ground's tiny sprinkles violently erupt, sending waves of color surging across the landscape.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The candy house exhales vibrant sugar dust, pulling the lollipops inward as their sticks ripple like liquid. Jelly candies melt into prismatic puddles, then reform inside out, their reflections twisting into impossible geometries. Sprinkles on the ground levitate, swirling into ghostly vortexes before vanishing with a silent pop, their sweetness expanding as a chromatic vapor.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera, initially high and sweeping, dramatically descends, revealing the shimmering candy house. A slow zoom-in highlights the sugary sparkle on the roof as a gentle breeze subtly sways the lollipop sticks. The camera then tracks along the path, reflections softly dancing on jelly candies, before a rapid, cinematic zoom to a single, undulating candy sprinkle, pulsating with faint, almost imperceptible movement.",
