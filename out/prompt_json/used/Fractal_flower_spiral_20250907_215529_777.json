    "video_prompt": "The glowing centers of the blue flowers subtly pulse, brightening and dimming. The translucent petals gently ripple and sway as if stirred by an unseen breeze, with delicate light streaks flowing along their veins. The entire spiral formation slowly rotates, subtly expanding outwards from the center. Tiny, shimmering sparks occasionally drift from the flower centers and dissolve into the darkness.",
    "image_prompt": "A visually striking fractal art piece with a dark, rich black background that dramatically highlights the luminous blue and purple hues within the artwork. The composition is a dynamic spiral pattern, where individual elements, resembling abstract flowers or starbursts with radiating petals, are arranged along the spiral's path. These elements emit a bright, glowing light, particularly from their centers, creating a strong contrast against the dark backdrop. The \"petals\" or \"rays\" of these forms are depicted with a delicate, translucent quality, showing subtle variations in blue and purple tones, almost like silk or glass threads. The light appears to emanate from within each form, casting soft glows that define their shapes and add to the ethereal atmosphere. The overall feeling is one of depth, luminosity, and mesmerizing movement, drawing the eye towards the bright, tightly coiled center of the spiral. The image possesses a dreamlike or fantastical quality due to its glowing, abstract forms and hypnotic arrangement.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Blue flowers subtly pulse with light, their translucent petals gently rippling and swaying. The entire spiral formation slowly rotates, subtly expanding outwards. Tiny, shimmering sparks drift from the centers and dissolve.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The blue blossoms EXPLODE outwards from the core. Their translucent petals violently WHIP and SNAP, unleashing RANDOMLY BURSTING light streas. The spiral structure rapidly SPINS and SHIFTS, launching radiant energy blasts. From the flower centers, SHARP, ERRATIC bolts of light PIERCE the darkness.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The iridescent petals stretch and spiral inward, absorbing light from the void. Each glowing flower center emits tendrils of pure energy, which then coalesce into new, smaller blossoms that bloom instantly and shatter like glass. The entire formation pulsates, not expanding, but folding inward upon itself, revealing impossible non-Euclidean geometries, as colors bleed and shift like waking dreams.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A single, luminous blue flower at the spiral's edge slowly expands, its translucent petals subtly rippling. The camera dramatically zooms in as its glowing center intensifies, then pulls back to reveal the entire formation gracefully rotating outwards, each flower pulsing in sync as shimmering sparks cascade, filling the deepening darkness with ethereal light.",
