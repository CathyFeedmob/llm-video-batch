  "video_prompt": "A vibrant, fantastical underwater world comes alive. Goldfish swim actively through colorful, shifting coral structures. A small sailboat gently bobs on granular water within an opened passion fruit, its sails fluttering. Bubbles rise and light streams, creating dynamic reflections on the water's surface. \n",
  "image_prompt": "Vibrant, imaginative underwater scene within a passion fruit. A detailed wooden sailboat floats on blue/purple granular \"water\" inside the halved fruit, surrounded by decorative elements like gold nuts, jelly candies, a seashell, and a yellow star. The surrounding \"ocean floor\" is textured with blue, purple, white, and orange granular material, featuring orange coral and small spheres. Numerous orange goldfish swim among the granular \"ocean\" and in the deep blue background, which is filled with bubbles. Golden light streams down from above, illuminating the fantastical miniature aquatic environment.",
