  "video_prompt": "A sleek spacecraft with glowing orange exhausts actively flies across the frame over a slowly cloud-covered planet. A colossal orbital structure's warm internal lights subtly flicker and pulse, indicating bustling activity. In the deep space background, a faint blue nebula gently shimmers. The entire scene undergoes a slow, majestic camera pan, tracking the spacecraft as it traverses the vast environment, emphasizing immense scale.",
  "image_prompt": "A breathtaking, painterly science fiction scene in deep space. A colossal, towering orbital city or industrial complex, rendered in intricate light grey metallic detail, glows with numerous warm orange and yellow lights, dominating the upper frame with immense vertical scale. In the foreground, a robust white and orange utility spacecraft, showing glowing orange exhaust ports, flies over the curved horizon of a distant planet. The planet features a thick white and light blue cloud atmosphere, revealing subtle darker geographical features below. A faint blue nebula is visible in the background. The low-angle perspective emphasizes epic scale and depth against the dark, star-filled void. Highly detailed mechanical design with a rich, textured, painterly aesthetic.",
