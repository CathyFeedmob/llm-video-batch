    "video_prompt": "A subtle cross dissolve or ripple effect on the water's surface, reflecting the character and surroundings. Individual flower petals gently sway in an imperceptible breeze. Her hair subtly shifts. The camera slowly zooms out.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull shot, a character resembling Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion, wearing her iconic orange plugsuit with black and lime green accents, kneeling in a shallow puddle of water. Her hands are covering her face as if crying or in despair, with subtle tear marks visible. Her reflection is clearly visible and distorted on the highly reflective water surface, showing her face and upper body upside down.\n\nThe setting is a vibrant, idyllic natural landscape. In the background are rolling hills and majestic mountains under a clear blue sky with soft, diffuse clouds. The midground and foreground are filled with a lush meadow of wildflowers in full bloom, featuring a rich variety of colors including purple, red, yellow, and white. The flowers grow around and into the water where the character is kneeling.\n\n**Art Style and Visual Elements:**\n* **Character:** Anime-inspired, detailed, high-quality rendering with a slight 3D PBR (Physically Based Rendering) feel on the plugsuit, showing realistic material textures and subtle reflections.\n* **Colors:** Predominantly vibrant and saturated. The orange of the plugsuit stands out against the rich blues of the sky and water, and the diverse palette of the wildflowers. Natural greens for grass and foliage.\n* **Lighting:** Soft, natural daylight from above, creating subtle shadows and highlights. The water surface acts as a mirror, reflecting the blue sky and the surrounding environment, enhancing the luminous quality of the scene.\n* **Composition:** Vertical full shot, character placed centrally but slightly to the left, with the reflection occupying the lower half of the frame, creating a strong sense of symmetry and balance. The horizon line is high, emphasizing the foreground and the water.\n* **Atmosphere:** Emotional, contemplative, and somewhat melancholic due to the character's pose, contrasted with the beauty and serenity of the natural environment. A sense of solitude.\n* **Details:** Small ripples on the water surface around her knees. Tiny specks or debris floating on the water. Fine details on the flowers and foliage, suggesting individual petals and leaves. Subtle textures on the distant mountains.\n\n**Negative Prompts (Optional but helpful):**\nCartoon, bad anatomy, deformed, ugly, distorted image in reflection, watermark, text, out of frame, cropped head, blurry, low resolution, bad hands (unless the AI often struggles).",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refinement:\n\nThe water's surface subtly ripples and shifts, reflecting the changing light. Individual flower petals gently sway with an unseen breeze. Her hair subtly undulates as the frame slowly expands outwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden geysers erupt from the water, violently distorting the reflection. Petals explode outwards, transforming into shimmering, sharp projectiles that pierce the air. Her hair whips into a chaotic vortex, crackling with raw energy. The mountains in the background writhe and twist, briefly revealing pulsating, glowing fissures. A blinding flash of light instantly consumes the scene, followed by a deafening roar as the ground beneath her ruptures.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The character's reflection shatters into iridescent butterflies that ascend into the sky, while actual flowers below morph into geometric metallic structures. Her tears reverse, flowing upwards into her eyes, then transform into golden musical notes that drift from her hair. The water solidifies into crystal shards, echoing her form, then melts into clouds that envelop the landscape. Gravity pulses, causing elements to momentarily float and then impossibly fall sideways.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A subtle ripple expands from her reflection, distorting the sorrow on her face as she lifts her tear-stained hands to the sky. A wind whips through the field, making her hair dance and petals scatter wildly. The camera arcs upward, revealing the expansive, vibrant meadow and towering mountains, before slowly zooming out further, diminishing her figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.",
