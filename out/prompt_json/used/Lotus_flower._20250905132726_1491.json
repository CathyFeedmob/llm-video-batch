  "video_prompt": "Lotus petals shift color gradients and emanate an ascending light beam. Ornate golden rings revolve around the flower. Root-like structures swirl and pulsate from the lotus base, interacting with rippling water exhibiting shimmering bokeh. Background stars and nebulae drift, while mountain mist subtly transforms.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a vibrant, vertical digital artwork: A magnificent, glowing lotus flower with multi-color gradient petals (pink, purple, blue, green, gold, orange) and golden outlines. A bright beam of light shoots upwards from the lotus into a dark, star-filled, cosmic-blue sky with nebulae. Two ornate golden rings encircle the lotus. Below the lotus, a swirling deep red tree-like structure and a vibrant, translucent blue flowing water/ice structure extend downwards, connecting to the rings and reaching into a serene, reflective lake with glowing ripples and bokeh. A jagged, snow-capped mountain range with mist is in the background. The overall impression is spiritual transcendence and cosmic energy.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Lotus petals dynamically shift color gradients, emanating an ascending light beam. Ornate golden rings revolve gracefully around the flower. Pulsating, root-like structures swirl from the base, interacting with the rippling water's shimmering, evolving bokeh. Background stars and nebulae gently drift, as mountain mist subtly transforms."
