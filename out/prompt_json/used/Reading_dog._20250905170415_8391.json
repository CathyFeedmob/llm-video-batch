  "video_prompt": "Akita's paws casually shift on a book as its gaze subtly tracks lines. Steam rises and dissipates from a mug. Subtle variations in ceiling light illuminate the scene as background elements subtly change focus. ",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** A cozy, warm-toned image featuring an Akita dog with light brown and cream fur, relaxed in a light wicker chair with a grey cushion, deeply focused on reading a book. Its paws rest casually on the book. To the dog's right, a white mug with a handle and an \"oC29\" logo emits steam on a small, light table. The background reveals a soft-blurred, white bookshelf filled with books and decorative elements, including baskets of pink and red artificial roses. A deep rose-colored wall section is visible behind the bookshelf. A rustic wicker lampshade hangs from the upper left, casting a soft, golden glow. The overall impression is tranquil and domestic, with sharp focus on the dog and foreground.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Paws gently shift and reposition on a surface, while a gaze subtly tracks across it. Wisps of steam continually rise and dissipate, forming and reforming above a warm source. Ambient illumination dynamically varies in intensity and direction, casting shifting highlights and shadows across the foreground. Simultaneously, distant background elements gradually unfocus and refocus, subtly altering depth perception."
