    "video_prompt": "A subtle twinkling of the stars in the background, the subtle shimmer of the starry galaxy pattern on the ground, the gentle flicker of the bus's headlights and light reflection on its roof and windows, and a slight sway of the small trees inside the bus.",
    "image_prompt": "A vivid, high-angle, eye-level shot of a whimsical tour bus, painted in the style of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night,\" driving on a fantastical, glitter-strewn road. The bus is bright green with accents of teal and blue. Its sides and roof are adorned with swirling patterns, reminiscent of Van Gogh's distinctive brushstrokes, featuring stars and a prominent crescent moon on the roof. Inside the bus, visible through its large windows, are lush fields of vibrant yellow flowers, akin to daffodils, with a few small green trees growing upright in the central window. The bus is illuminated from the front and back by bright, golden sun-like flares, creating strong, elongated shadows behind and to the side of the bus. The road itself is a rich tapestry of deep red, orange, and golden hues, speckled with glitter that catches the light like tiny stars. White, abstract geometric lines, resembling a circuit board or constellation pattern, are drawn on the road in the foreground. The background is a soft blur of blues, purples, and yellows, with scattered, out-of-focus lights suggesting a distant, starry sky or galaxy. The overall atmosphere is dreamlike and surreal, blending natural beauty with artistic fantasy. Below the image on the right there is a watermark of a unique font in white color that says \"b29\", and the background of the image is completely covered by the artwork.\n\n**_CROP_**\n**Top Left:** A blurred view of the \"Starry Night\"-inspired background, showing swirling blue and purple hues with yellow stars and bokeh lights.\n**Top Right:** A closer look at the bus's roof, revealing the golden sun-like flare and part of the \"Starry Night\" pattern with a crescent moon and green trees.\n**Mid Left:** The front section of the bus, highlighting its green color, the Van Gogh-style paintwork, the yellow flowers inside the front window, and the brightly lit headlights.\n**Mid Right:** The middle section of the bus, showcasing the yellow flowers and green trees inside the windows, the \"Starry Night\" painting on its side, and the reflections of light on the windows.\n**Bottom Left:** The front wheels of the bus and the colorful, glittery road with strong shadows cast by the bus and illuminating its path.\n**Bottom Right:** The abstract geometric lines on the road, the glitter scattered across the surface, the bus's shadow, and the \"b29\" watermark in the bottom right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The stars gently twinkle. The ground's galaxy pattern subtly shimmers as the bus's headlights softly flicker, reflecting on its roof and windows. Small internal trees delicately sway.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Flash! Cosmic vortex ablaze, engulfing stars! Bus erupts, headlights explode, beaming supernova! Roof shimmers into shattered glass, trees thrash wildly, bursting through windows! Ground cracks, galaxy dust swirls into a maelstrom, devouring the path! Whirling chaos! Dynamic cataclysm!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The bus, a swirling nebula of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night,\" gently levitates, its headlights emitting ethereal star-trails that ripple across the galactic ground. Tiny trees within sway in reverse, absorbing moonlight into bloom. Reflections on the windows morph into shimmering constellations, before gracefully dissolving into the cosmic vortex beneath.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A cinematic slow zoom-in from the starry background reveals a vibrant, Van Gogh-esque bus. The camera subtly tracks its gentle roll forward, catching the twinkling headlight beams dancing across the patterned ground. As it moves, the reflection of the starry sky shimmers across its windows, and sunlight catches the gentle sway of the tiny trees inside, culminating in a dramatic, focused shot on the intricate details painted on the bus's side.",
