  "video_prompt": "Glowing \"CIVIL 29\" forms ripple and circuit structures animate. Golden crowns pulsate. Gears rotate and interlock. A horizontal bar extends and retracts. A \"play\" triangle lights up and dims within the \"9.\" Olive branches subtly sway. Background digital characters continuously shift and glow.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a vertical image with glowing blue neon-style text \"CIVIL 29\" and \"c29\" against a dark, futuristic circuit board background with subtle digital characters. \"CIVIL\" and \"29\" have internal circuit structures. Integrate golden radiating crown elements above \"I\" and \"L\" in \"CIVIL\", below the blue bar, and on the '2' of \"29\". Include interacting silver gears between \"V\" and \"I\" of \"CIVIL\". The '9' of \"29\" contains a golden play button triangle. Add dark green olive branches in the bottom right corner.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "The original prompt is already excellent, perfectly adhering to all specified constraints by exclusively describing movement, change, and background alterations while remaining concise.\n\nHere's a subtle refinement for slightly enhanced flow and emphasis on continuous action:\n\nGlowing \"CIVIL 29\" forms ripple as circuit structures animate. Golden crowns pulsate. Gears rotate, continuously interlocking. A horizontal bar dynamically extends and retracts. Within the \"9\", a \"play\" triangle lights up and dims. Olive branches subtly sway. Background digital characters continuously shift and glow."
