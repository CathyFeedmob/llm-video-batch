    "video_prompt": "The doll blinks slowly, her chest subtly rising and falling as if breathing. Her long hair sways gently to the left, as if caught in a light breeze. The small attachments on her belt and arms also show a slight, almost imperceptible sway. Tiny dust motes drift lazily in the soft light around her. A very slow, almost imperceptible dolly zoom pulls the camera back just a fraction.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on recreating its visual elements, style, and atmosphere:\n\n**Detailed Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A full-body shot of a realistic, highly detailed ball-jointed doll (BJD) resembling a young girl, standing upright.\n\n**Appearance:**\n*   **Hair:** Long, straight, dark brown hair flowing down past her shoulders.\n*   **Face:** Delicate, doll-like features with large, expressive, slightly downcast dark brown eyes, subtle blush on cheeks, and light pink lips. Small nose and chin.\n*   **Headwear:** Light brown baseball cap worn slightly tilted, with vintage-style dark-lensed aviator goggles resting on top of the brim.\n*   **Outfit:**\n    *   **Top:** Loose-fitting short-sleeved t-shirt in a muted, desaturated light brown/khaki color with distressed black letters \"BJ\" printed on the front. A hint of white ruffled fabric is visible at the sleeves.\n    *   **Necklace:** A chunky, multi-layered black beaded necklace with a silver or dark metal pendant.\n    *   **Backpack:** Small, tactical-style light brown/khaki backpack with visible straps over the shoulders.\n    *   **Skirt:** Pleated mini-skirt in a matching muted light brown/khaki color.\n    *   **Belt:** Dark brown leather belt with a prominent silver buckle, cinching the waist.\n    *   **Accessories:** Small, closed flap pouch in matching light brown/khaki attached to the belt on her left hip. Dark brown wrist wraps/bracelets on both wrists, with a small decorative item (possibly a carabiner or miniature tool) hanging from the right wrist.\n    *   **Socks:** Ribbed, bunched-up ankle socks in a slightly darker brown/tan color.\n    *   **Footwear:** Rugged, lace-up ankle boots in a distressed, matte light brown leather, with dark brown soles and prominent stitching.\n\n**Pose & Composition:**\n*   **Pose:** Standing straight, facing directly forward, arms relaxed at her sides.\n*   **Composition:** Full-body portrait, centered, with ample space above her head and below her feet. Shot from a slightly low angle to emphasize her presence.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Lighting:** Soft, diffused, natural daylight. Evenly lit with minimal harsh shadows. The lighting suggests an overcast or slightly hazy day.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Post-apocalyptic, desolate, slightly eerie, but also calm.\n*   **Color Palette:** Dominated by earthy tones: various shades of desaturated browns, grays, and muted greens.\n\n**Background:**\n*   **Environment:** A ruined, industrial, or urban wasteland. The ground is covered in debris, rubble, and cracked concrete.\n*   **Elements:** Out-of-focus, rusted metal structures, and remnants of buildings are visible in the background, implying destruction. The sky is a soft, light gray/blue, obscured by mist or haze.\n\n**Overall Style:**\n*   Hyperrealistic photography, high detail, sharp focus on the doll.\n*   Gritty, survivalist, steampunk-inspired aesthetic for the doll's attire, contrasted with her delicate features.\n*   \"AI Generated\" text watermark in the top left corner, and \"C29\" text overlay in the bottom right corner, stylized in a distressed white font.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "A doll blinks, her chest subtly rising and falling. Her hair and belt/arm attachments sway gently. Tiny dust motes drift around her. A very slow, almost imperceptible dolly zoom pulls the camera back.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Her synthetic eyes snap open wide. The ground beneath her buckles and cracks, sending dust pluming into the air and scattering debris. Her hair whips violently around her as the abandoned structures in the background contort and collapse with a sudden, deafening roar. Her limbs jerk unnaturally, then twist and stretch to impossible lengths, as if pulled by unseen forces. The air itself shimmers and distorts, hints of an explosion rippling outwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The doll blinks, and with each blink, her eyes reverse-rotate within their sockets, colors bleeding into negative. Her hair flows upwards, defying gravity, transforming into shimmering, sentient vines that slowly entwine the background's wreckage. The belt attachments melt into liquid gold, dripping upwards onto her skirt, which instantly expands and contracts like a living organism. Dust motes coalesce into glowing, miniature galaxies swirling around her. The camera's dolly zoom becomes a recursive loop, simultaneously pulling back and pushing in, revealing impossible, fractal dimensions within the scene.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "An extreme cinematic dolly zoom pulls backwards from the doll's intense gaze. As the camera recedes, her long hair sweeps dramatically to the left, caught in an unseen gust. The belt attachments and arm straps sway sharply, accentuating a sudden, powerful inhale as her chest expands. Dust motes swirl wildly, illuminated by flickering light as the scene transitions, revealing an unseen force at play.",
