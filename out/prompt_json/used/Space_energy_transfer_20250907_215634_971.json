    "video_prompt": "Subtle glow fluctuations around the base of each structure on the moon's surface. Faint shimmering within the blue beams extending from the structures to Earth. Tiny, almost imperceptible dust particles gently drifting near the lunar surface. The distant starlight in the background could exhibit a very slow, subtle twinkle.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA mesmerizing futuristic scene on the moon's surface at night, featuring a series of tall, sleek, and intricate sci-fi power conduits or towering structures, each emitting a powerful, bright blue light beam directly upwards into space. These towers are arranged in a dynamic perspective, leading the eye towards the grand backdrop of a large, vibrant Earth, prominently displaying continents like Africa and Europe, bathed in moonlight and the Earth's own atmospheric glow.\n\nThe lunar landscape is rocky and barren, with visible craters and subtle topographical variations, accentuating the stark contrast between the natural celestial body and the advanced artificial structures. The ground around each structure glows with an ethereal blue light, creating an intricate energy pattern or ripple effect, suggesting immense power generation or transmission.\n\nThe overall composition is vertical and epic, emphasizing the scale of the towers and the Earth. The lighting is dominated by the intense blue luminescence from the towers, casting long shadows and highlights on the lunar surface, and backlighting the Earth from a celestial light source (possibly the distant sun, though not directly visible). The atmosphere is cool, futuristic, and awe-inspiring, conveying a sense of advanced technology bridging two worlds.\n\n**Key visual elements:**\n\n*   **Structures:** Multiple (at least 5-7 visible) tall, white and dark grey sci-fi towers/conduits, each with distinct sections, glowing blue accents, and radiating blue beams. They have a sturdy, industrial, yet elegant design.\n*   **Light Beams:** Intense, vertical, bright blue energy beams shooting upwards from the top of each structure.\n*   **Ground Emissions:** Circular or rippling blue light emanating from the base of each structure onto the moon's surface.\n*   **Lunar Surface:** Grey, rocky, cratered, barren moonscape with visible rocks and subtle undulations.\n*   **Earth:** Large, prominent, detailed view of Earth in the background, showcasing continents (Africa, Europe), oceans, and clouds. Lit to reveal its spherical shape and atmospheric glow.\n*   **Space:** Dark, star-filled sky, with subtle cosmic dust or nebulae in the vastness beyond Earth.\n\n**Style & Composition:**\n\n*   **Style:** Sci-fi, futuristic, photographic, highly detailed, realistic rendering.\n*   **Composition:** Vertical orientation, deep perspective with towers leading to the Earth, rule of thirds applied loosely with dominant elements. The central tower is the most prominent.\n*   **Perspective:** Low-angle shot from the moon's surface looking up towards Earth.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   **Dominant:** Deep blues (energy beams, glows), cool greys (moon, tower exteriors), various shades of blue/green/brown (Earth).\n*   **Accents:** Subtle whites (tower details, star points), very faint yellow/orange (implied distant light on Earth's limb).\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\n\n*   **Lighting:** Predominantly artificial blue light from the structures, providing both illumination and visual interest. Natural light source (sun) illuminating Earth from behind the moon, creating a subtle rim light and glare effect. Stars dotting the dark sky.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Grand, monumental, mysterious, technologically advanced, and awe-inspiring. Evokes a sense of human or alien ambition and connection across celestial bodies.\n\n**Artistic considerations:**\n\n*   High level of detail on both the structures and the lunar surface.\n*   Smooth, realistic rendering of light and reflections.\n*   Dramatic contrast between the dark space/moon and the bright blue light.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle glow fluctuations at structure bases. Faint shimmering in blue beams to Earth. Imperceptible dust drift near surface. Slow, subtle starlight twinkle in background.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The lunar surface violently cracks and heaves as powerful seismic pulses rip outward from the base of each structure, sending dust and debris exploding skyward. The blue beams surge with electric arcs and chaotic, swirling energy, thrashing unpredictably as they connect to Earth. Stars in the background abruptly flash and streak across the cosmos, leaving fiery trails. The moon itself trembles, its mountains shifting and collapsing under an unseen force.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "From the lunar surface, structures sprout crystalline wings, flapping impossibly to lift off, trailing luminescent dust that solidifies into shimmering bridges connecting them to Earth. The blue beams, now liquid light, snake downwards, swirling into miniature black holes that absorb continents, then regurgitate them as ephemeral star-maps. Below, moon rocks melt into sentient, glowing rivers, flowing uphill into the sky, where they coalesce into a colossal, weeping eye that reflects a past Earth, now entirely made of music.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Cinematic Prompt:**\n\nA slow, sweeping camera pans across the stark lunar surface, revealing towering luminous structures. As the camera dramatically zooms into the base of one structure, a subtle blue glow intensifies, revealing intricate energy patterns. The scene cuts to a dynamic upward tilt, following the shimmering blue beam as it pierces the inky blackness towards Earth. A quick pan reveals other beams, pulsating with faint fluctuations, as specks of \"lunar dust\" drift cinematically in their path. The camera then smoothly pulls back, showcasing the grand scale of the operation against the backdrop of a slowly twinkling cosmic ballet.",
