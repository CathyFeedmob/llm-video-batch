    "video_prompt": "Subtle sway of large mushroom caps, glowing underbellies gently pulse,\nsmall mushrooms softly float and drift in the distant air.\nVines hanging from trees lightly sway.\nGentle camera pan from bottom left upwards.\nSmall creatures fly and dart between buildings.\nWarm glows from windows softly flicker.\nDust motes dance in rays of light.",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, whimsical fantasy village nestled in a lush, green valley, dominated by colossal, glowing red-capped mushrooms with bright orange undersides that illuminate the scene. The architecture consists of quaint, hobbit-hole-like houses built into the hillside, constructed from stone and wood, with warm, inviting light streaming from their intricately designed windows. Overgrown vines and foliage adorn the buildings and the bases of the giant mushrooms. A winding, cobbled path leads through the village, detailed with interesting patterns on some of the stones. In the background, tall, pointed, dark green mountains or rock formations rise dramatically against a partly cloudy, bright sky with hints of sunlight. The overall atmosphere is magical, enchanted, and peaceful, with a soft, warm glow emanating from the mushrooms and houses. The composition is a low-angle shot looking up towards the towering mushrooms, creating a sense of wonder and immersion.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Refined prompt:\n\nLarge mushroom caps subtly sway, their glowing underbellies gently pulsing. Small mushrooms softly float and drift. Vines lightly sway. The camera gently pans upwards. Small creatures dart between buildings. Window glows softly flicker. Dust motes dance in light rays.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Giant mushroom caps *violently* undulate, their glowing underbellies *exploding* with light. Distant small mushrooms *rocket* by. Vines *thrash* from trees, buildings *lurch* and *twist*. Swarms of creatures *dive-bomb* the scene. Windows *blaze* with erratic flames as dust motes *erupt* into swirling vortexes. The camera *slams* and *jolts* upward, capturing the chaotic upheaval.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Crimson mushroom caps inverted, draining light into the sky, then slowly bloom, exhaling brilliant dust motes that solidify into floating, reverse-growing mushrooms. Vines, like liquid emeralds, pour upwards into unseen dimensions. Stone cottages sprout wooden wings, flapping gently, as their glowing windows inhale and exhale light. Tiny figures, spun from starlight, flicker in and out of existence, painting new landscapes across the mushroom gills as the world pulses with an impossible, silent song.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide shot establishes a mystical village nestled among giant, luminous mushrooms. The camera slowly pans right, revealing the soft pulsing glow beneath mushroom caps. A gentle breeze causes vines hanging from ancient trees to sway, while dust motes dance in rays of sunlight piercing through the canopy. The camera then smoothly glides forward, past charming hobbit-like homes with softly flickering window lights, towards a cobbled path. Small, winged creatures flit playfully around, and a subtle light change hints at a mystical transition.",
