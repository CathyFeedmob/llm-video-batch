    "video_prompt": "A gentle breeze causes the long, flowing sleeves of the traditional garment to softly ripple. Her hair ribbons sway subtly. The delicate ribbons in her hair dance gently. Small, indistinct clouds drift slowly across the light blue sky.",
    "image_prompt": "A beautiful serene goddess-like woman, with dark long hair styled in an elaborate updo with delicate floral accessories, sits gracefully on a fluffy white cloud against a soft blue sky with scattered light clouds. She is dressed in a flowing, multi-layered traditional Chinese-inspired gown with hues of light pink, teal, and white, adorned with subtle gold details and a golden brooch holding part of her dress. Her eyes are closed, evoking a sense of peaceful meditation or concentration as she gently plays a traditional stringed instrument, possibly a guqin, made of dark wood with golden accents. The lighting is soft and ethereal, highlighting the delicate fabrics and the woman's tranquil expression. The overall atmosphere is dreamlike, mythical, and serene. In the bottom right corner, there's a red text overlay \"c29\" with a white outline.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The garment's long sleeves gently ripple. Hair ribbons subtly sway and dance. Indistinct clouds slowly drift.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The ethereal guqin, suddenly alive, vibrates with violent force, strings snapping and showering sparks. Her flowing sleeves, now jagged and whip-like, lash out, propelled by invisible gales. Ribbons in her hair transform into serpentine tendrils, writhing and twisting dramatically. The clouds, no longer indistinct, writhe and swirl, coalescing into an electrifying vortex as the sky cracks with blinding light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A celestial gust reverses, drawing the Gugin upwards as the woman and billowing ribbons descend, the cloud below gently expanding to cushion her fall. The sky's hue ripples, bleeding into pastel greens and purples as the instrument's strings vibrate invisibly, playing a phantom melody.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A gentle breeze ripples her long sleeves as the camera slowly pulls back, revealing her atop a celestial guqin. She closes her eyes, a single tear tracing her cheek, reflecting the ethereal glow of the sky. The camera dramatically zooms in on her hands as she gracefully plucks the strings, an unseen force causing the clouds to swirl and converge around her. Her ribbons dance wildly, mirroring the building crescendo as she finishes her song, a burst of light enveloping her.",
