    "video_prompt": "Wisps of smoke billow from under the back wheel, small debris lifts and falls around the wheels, and the rider's hair sways slightly in the wind. The motorcycle's headlights subtly flicker.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that aims to recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA fierce young woman with long, dark, wind-swept hair, wearing a sleek, form-fitting black leather jumpsuit with a thin red zipper accent, rides a futuristic, modified motorcycle. She is mid-air, having just launched off a rocky, dusty urban ground, with debris flying up around her. Her expression is intense and focused.\n\n**Motorcycle:** The motorcycle is predominantly black with bright, glowing cyan/blue rings around the deep dish wheel rims, contrasting with the black tires. The front wheel is slightly turned, and the front headlight has twin, bright orange-yellow glowing lights. The design is robust and somewhat industrial, with visible engine components.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:** Dynamic low-angle shot, looking up at the elevated motorcycle and rider. The rider and bike fill a significant portion of the frame, emphasizing their power and movement. The background features blurred, tall, modern city buildings under an overcast or hazy sky, suggesting a cityscape in motion or aftermath.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:** Bright, slightly overcast lighting. Light sources from the motorcycle's headlights cast a warm glow. Smoke or dust rises from the ground below, enhancing the sense of impact and action. Debris (small rocks, dirt, metal scraps) are clearly visible flying around the wheels, indicating the force of the jump.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, cinematic, action-movie aesthetic. Sharp focus on the subject with a shallow depth of field, blurring the background to emphasize motion and the central figures. High detail on the leather textures of the suit and the mechanical parts of the motorcycle.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Smoke billows and dissipates at the rear wheel. Debris lifts and settles around the tires. The rider's hair sways gently. Headlights subtly flicker, casting dynamic light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The entire street explodes upward as the motorcycle blasts off, flinging debris in violent bursts. Sparks erupt from the ground, morphing into wild flares that chase the accelerating bike. The concrete cracks and shatters, revealing pulsating energy beneath. Clouds of smoke violently swirl and reform into swirling vortexes around the wheels, pulling chunks of the road skyward. The rider's hair whips into a frenzy, extending impossibly long and coiling like tendrils of shadow, her eyes flashing with electric intensity as the bike defies gravity with sudden, powerful lurches.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Reverse gravity pulls the motorcycle skyward, debris morphing into shimmering butterflies that ascend, while the rider's hair cascades downward against the impossible upward motion. Headlights bloom into miniature nebulae, colors swirling and bleeding into the air. The back wheel spins backward, sucking smoke into its core, time itself reversing around the impossibly floating machine.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle shot reveals the motorcycle, its glowing wheels hovering over debris that scatters dynamically. The camera sweeps up as the female rider, clad in sleek black leather, her hair dramatically flowing in the wind, accelerates fiercely. Red light streaks from the bike's undercarriage, engulfing the scene in a fleeting, intense glow. The camera then tracks a frantic, high-speed chase through the urban canyon.",
