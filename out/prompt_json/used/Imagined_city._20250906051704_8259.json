  "video_prompt": "Camera pulls back from a glowing brioche canal with floating candy-laden boats and walking figures. Edible skyscrapers of flaking pastries and bread with arched entrances rise as the scene pans across a vibrant, moving cityscape of donut platforms and pastel-roofed mini-buildings. Silhouetted food-structures blur in the distance under a shifting sky.",
  "image_prompt": "Whimsical surreal cityscape made entirely of pastries and food items, elevated perspective. A fluffy brioche bun floats in a tranquil blue canal with colorful candy-laden boats and tiny figures. A towering skyscraper of golden pastries topped with green cream stands beside a colossal bread-slice building with an arched entrance and a futuristic ring. Mini-buildings with pastel roofs, large glazed donuts, and smaller donut stacks are integrated throughout. Bright lighting, warm browns, golden yellows, creamy whites, and delicate pastels dominate the inviting scene.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "The camera pulls back from a canal where surface light actively shimmers. Candy-laden boats drift and figures walk along the banks. As the scene pans, pastry skyscrapers emerge into view. Donut platforms dynamically shift within the moving cityscape, while distant food-structures subtly blur. Overhead, the sky continually alters its appearance."
