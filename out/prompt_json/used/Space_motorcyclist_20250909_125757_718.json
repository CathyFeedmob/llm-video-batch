    "video_prompt": "The motorcycle kicks up a subtle trail of moon dust as it speeds across the lunar surface, illuminated by the distant moon. Streaks of light from the engine flair behind, indicating speed. The rider's helmet visor subtly reflects the cosmic background as stars slowly drift by.",
    "image_prompt": "A dynamic, comic book-style illustration of a futuristic figure riding a motorcycle across a rocky, moon-like landscape at high speed. The rider, wearing a sleek turquoise and pink suit with a matching helmet, is positioned centrally, leaning into a turn. The motorcycle is also turquoise with pink accents on its wheels and lights, contributing to a vibrant, neon aesthetic.\n\nThe background features a vast, star-filled black sky with a prominent, large moon (or planet) in the upper right. Streaks of pink and blue light emanate from the rider and motorcycle, conveying motion and speed, contrasting sharply with the dark sky. The ground beneath is craggy and stark white, creating a strong contrast with the dark background and colorful foreground.\n\nThe overall color palette is dominated by electric blues/turquoises and hot pinks against a black and white backdrop. The art style is bold and graphic, reminiscent of a retro-futuristic comic or science fiction anime, with clear lines and vibrant, flat colors. The composition is angled to enhance the sense of speed and action. In the bottom right corner, the text \"C29\" appears in a vibrant pink, brushstroke-like font.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The motorcycle rapidly progresses left to right, kicking up a low, trailing cloud of dust. Flashes of light emanate from the rear of the vehicle, elongating. The rider's head slightly shifts, causing the helmet visor to subtly glimmer and reflect passing specks of light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Lunar dust erupts violently as the motorcycle blasts forward, engine flares igniting the black. The ground beneath buckles, sending rocks hurtling. The distant moon shudders, its surface rippling with unseen force. Stars streak past, blurring into frenetic light trails as the rider's visor flashes with warped reflections. The bike swerves, defying gravity, as cosmic energy pulses around it.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The motorcycle warps space, its pink trail morphing into shimmering wormholes while the rider, bathed in a teal glow, phases through solid moon rock. Stars, defying gravity, flow *into* the reflective visor, then cascade outwards as a vibrant, impossibly fluid stream. The \"moon\" in the sky shrinks and expands, pulling and pushing the ground beneath, the bike levitating on the crest of a time-reversing wave.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A wide shot of the vibrant turquoise motorcycle kicking up luminescent pink moon dust. The camera immediately tracks the rider, a sleek form in a matching suit. As it sweeps past, the moon in the distance looms, filling the frame. The camera pulls back dramatically as the bike accelerates into a full-throttle sprint, leaving a neon pink trail, stars streaking into dazzling lines, and the rider's visor reflects the mesmerizing cosmic dance. The final shot is a triumphant close-up of the front wheel, perfectly framed by the glowing number C29.",
