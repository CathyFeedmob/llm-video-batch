  "video_prompt": "An ancient, gnarled tree slowly unfurls new, brightly glowing leaves. Sunbeams shift and dance, illuminating airborne motes. Shadows deepen in the alleyway as faint, orange-yellow light subtly pulsates from distant windows. Moss-covered stairs invite exploration.",
  "image_prompt": "Vertical full shot: narrow alley between old concrete buildings, dark gnarled tree trunk spanning the gap, vibrant green and yellow-orange leaves from a smaller tree glowing in sunlight. Arched shadowy opening on left frames bright view beyond; tall, textured wall on right with glowing windows. Weathered architecture, mossy stairs, dramatic lighting with dust motes. Urban decay softened by resilient nature, mystical charm.",
