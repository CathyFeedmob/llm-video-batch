    "video_prompt": "Subtle head tilt and soft eye blinks. Hair strands around the face gently sway. Microphone slightly shifts as fingers adjust grip. Golden hoop earring sways. Particles subtly glitter around the face and shoulders. Soft light pulses from the bottom left, mimicking stage lights.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nClose-up of a captivating anime-style female singer with medium-length, dark hair cascading around her face. Her striking aqua blue eyes with golden highlights on the iris are the focal point, expressing a mix of intensity and vulnerability. She has a delicate nose and slightly parted lips, with light pink blush on her cheeks studded with subtle white sparkles mimicking stage glitter. Her left hand is raised, fingers slightly curled, while her right hand holds a dark grey microphone, bringing it close to her mouth. She wears a glossy black outfit with golden accents, possibly a leather-like material, and a prominent golden hoop earring on her left ear. The lighting is dramatic and dynamic, suggesting stage lights and creating noticeable reflections on her hair and attire. The background is a soft, blurred stage environment with glowing circular light sources, slightly out of focus, creating a vibrant concert atmosphere. The overall style is reminiscent of popular anime/manga art, with intricate detail in the eyes and hair, and careful use of color and shading to enhance depth and emotion. A subtle \"c29\" watermark is in the lower right corner.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Here are a few options, refining the prompt for conciseness and pure motion/change, while staying under 100 words:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on subtle, natural movement):**\n\n> Head subtly tilts, eyes blink softly. Hair strands gently sway. Microphone subtly shifts as fingers adjust grip. Golden hoop earring sways. Glittering particles subtly dance around face and shoulders. Soft light pulses from bottom left.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly more descriptive of *how* things move):**\n\n> A gentle head tilt and soft blinks. Hair strands ripple around the face. The microphone incrementally shifts as fingers tighten their hold. A golden hoop earring gently oscillates. Glittering particles subtly shimmer around the face and shoulders. Warm light pulses up from the bottom left.\n\n**Option 3 (Emphasis on dynamic elements):**\n\n> Gradual head tilt and intermittent eye blinks. Cascading hair strands sway. Microphone subtly repositions with a grip adjustment. Golden hoop earring swings. Shimmering particles subtly fleck the air around the face and shoulders. A soft light pulses rhythmically from the bottom left.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "A rapid head snap with hair wildly splaying. Microphone violently thrown forward, fingers gripping like talons. Earring whips dramatically, sparks erupting. Swirling dust clouds around the face and shoulders. Intense, strobing lights flash explosively from below, engulfing the scene in a blaze.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Eyelashes unfurl into feathered wings briefly, fluttering back to lashes. Hair strands glow and morph into liquid gold, cascading upwards. The microphone pulses with light, then dissolves into a nebula of shimmering dust, reforming. The hoop earring elongates into a golden serpent, swirling and then returning to its original form. Glitter particles multiply, forming celestial patterns before vanishing. Stage lights ripple into spectral tendrils, dancing and then receding into the floor.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "Dramatic close-up on shimmering eyes, then a slow, deliberate pan down to reveal the microphone held firmly. The camera gracefully arcs up, following a tendril of hair as it sways, then sweeps past a glinting golden earring. As the lights pulse intensely, a subtle, almost imperceptible head tilt conveys emotional depth, culminating in a soft focus on the glittering particles, creating a dreamlike, cinematic finale.",
