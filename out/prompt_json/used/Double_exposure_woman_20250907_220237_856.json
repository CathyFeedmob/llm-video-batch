    "video_prompt": "Subtle swaying of the translucent fabric around the woman's form. Gentle rippling and foaming of the ocean waves. Soft shimmering of the sunset light on the water and sand. Slight movement of the people on the beach. Very slow, subtle zoom out of the camera.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt designed to recreate the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Central Concept:** Double exposure silhouette of a woman formed by a sunset beach scene, with ethereal fabric flowing from her head.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** A silhouetted profile of a woman from the chest up, facing left. Her head and upper body are clearly defined by the outline, while her lower body tapers into an abstract shape.\n*   **Fabric/Veil:** A translucent, flowing, cyan-blue fabric or veil emanates from the woman's head and flows dynamically around her form, creating graceful curves and folds. The fabric is sheer enough to reveal the scene behind it but also has a visible texture.\n*   **Inner Scene (Double Exposure):**\n    *   **Sky:** Vibrant sunset sky with gradients of orange, yellow, and red, transitioning to lighter hues towards the horizon. Visible clouds, some streaky, reflect the sunset colors.\n    *   **Sun:** A bright, intense sun positioned near the horizon on the left, casting a strong golden glow.\n    *   **Landscape (Left):** A rugged, dark cliff face extends from the left side towards the center, appearing as part of the woman's profile.\n    *   **Beach:** A long, curved sandy beach with prominent reflections of the sunset on the wet sand. Several small, silhouetted figures (people) are visible walking on the beach.\n    *   **Ocean:** Waves gently breaking on the shore, with visible white foam. The ocean water reflects the sky colors, but also shows typical blue-green tones.\n    *   **Rocks (Foreground):** Dark, craggy rocks are visible in the very bottom left, adding texture to the lower part of the silhouette.\n*   **Background:** Solid, subtle gradient of dark grey to slate blue, providing a clean contrast to the subject.\n*   **Text/Logo:** A minimalist white logo \"c29.\" in a stylish, flowing script font, placed in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Photorealistic with Artistic Flair:** The internal beach scene should be photorealistic, while the overall composition has an artistic, conceptual, and somewhat abstract feel due to the silhouette and fabric.\n*   **Double Exposure/Overlay:** The primary artistic technique is a clear double exposure, where the landscape is contained within the silhouette and the flowing fabric.\n*   **Ethereal/Dreamlike:** The flowing fabric and the soft sunset tones contribute to an ethereal, dreamlike quality.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Portrait Orientation:** Tall, vertical orientation.\n*   **Central Dominance:** The silhouette of the woman is the central and dominant element, occupying most of the vertical space.\n*   **Rule of Thirds (Implied):** The sun is roughly positioned on a \"rule of thirds\" intersection point, creating a focal point within the internal scene.\n*   **Flowing Lines:** The lines of the fabric and the curve of the bay create dynamic, flowing lines that lead the eye.\n*   **Negative Space:** Significant negative space on the right and top, emphasizing the silhouette.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Warm Tones (Internal):** Dominant oranges, yellows, and reds from the sunset. Golden light.\n*   **Cool Tones (External/Fabric):** Teal, cyan, and deep blue in the flowing fabric and the ocean. Grey and slate blue in the background.\n*   **Contrast:** Strong contrast between the warm internal colors and the cool fabric/background colors. Dark silhouettes of the cliff and people against bright skies/sand.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Sunset Lighting:** Low angle, warm, golden light emanating from the sun.\n*   **Dramatic Shadows:** Long shadows on the beach and the cliff face, characteristic of sunset.\n*   **Backlighting:** The woman's silhouette is effectively backlit by the internal sunset scene.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Calm and Serene:** Despite the dramatic sunset, the overall feeling is peaceful and contemplative.\n*   **Awe-Inspiring:** The beauty of the natural landscape evokes a sense of awe.\n*   **Mysterious/Metaphorical:** The concept of nature embodying a human form, or vice-versa, adds a layer of mystery and metaphor.\n\n---\n\n**Concise Prompt Summary:**\n\n**Visual:** Double exposure of a tranquil sunset beach scene within a stylized, silhouetted profile of a woman. Ethereal, translucent cyan-blue fabric flows dynamically from her head, partially obscuring the vibrant orange and red sunset over a beach with breaking waves and silhouetted figures. Dark cliff/rocks outline the left side. **Style:** Artistic photorealism, dreamlike, metaphorical, double exposure. **Composition:** Portrait, central female silhouette. **Colors:** Dominant warm oranges and golds contrasting with cool teals and deep greys. **Lighting:** Intense, low-angle sunset glow. **Atmosphere:** Serene, contemplative, awe-inspiring. **Details:** Subtle film grain, crisp focus on the internal scene.

    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle fabric undulations hug the woman. Ocean surface gently churns and crests. Sunlight shimmers softly across the water and sand. Figures on the beach shift imperceptibly. Camera perspective recedes incrementally.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Explosive fabric contorts violently, ripped by unseen forces. Tidal waves surge, consuming the rapidly sinking beach and fleeing figures. The sunset explodes into a blinding supernova, incinerating the land, melting the ocean, and causing the very air to ignite. A supernatural storm of energy consumes all.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A ghostly woman's form, woven from twilight and spun light, unravels into a cascade of swirling ocean. Waves crest inwards, defying gravity, drawing the sun back into the sky while sands melt into shimmering stardust. Distant figures morph into ethereal mist, fading backwards into the unfolding horizon as colors bleed like a watercolor dream, all within the illusion of a slow, impossible zoom.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic zoom out reveals a woman's silhouette formed by billowing, translucent fabric. Inside, the camera subtly pans down a vibrant sunset beach. Waves crash with quiet power, individual reflections shimmering. Figures on the sand move with ethereal grace, a solitary walker slowly approaches the viewer. The fabric shimmers, then slowly recedes, revealing \"c29.\" as a soft lens flare consumes the scene.",
