    "video_prompt": "Subtle sway of the dragon's tail, faint glow and flicker in the dragon's eyes, wisps of mist drifting in the background, gentle flickering of the distant red lights, slight ripple and glow along the blade of the sword, the woman's hair gently shifting as if in a slight breeze, and delicate sway of the red ribbons in her hair.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt based on the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nFull body, dynamic pose, striking portrayal of an East Asian warrior woman looking over her shoulder at the viewer, set in ancient, ruined architecture with a mystical atmosphere. She has short, dark hair, styled loosely with red ribbons, and subtle red highlights near her face. Her fair skin is adorned with intricate, large, light blue and red floral tattoos covering her upper back and left shoulder, slightly visible on her right. She wears a black, minimalist top that exposes her back, and a flowing dark skirt cinched with extensive red sashes and bindings. A katana with a glowing, iridescent blue-purple blade and elaborate gold hilt is held in her right hand, pointed downwards. Another katana with a black and gold hilt is sheathed at her left hip.\n\nDominating the background is a massive, coiled East Asian dragon with dark scales, red eyes glowing with an inner light, and red accents on its spikes, emerging from a hazy, overcast sky. Its form creates a circular frame around the warrior woman's head and torso. The setting is an ethereal, dimly lit twilight or early dawn, with a cool, muted blue-gray color palette dominating the ruins and sky. Scattered glowing red orbs float in the mid-ground, and vibrant red flowers (possibly peonies or camellias) with dark green foliage are strategically placed in the foreground and around the ruins, adding pops of warm color. The ground consists of rough stone steps and debris.\n\n**Art Style:** Traditional Asian art with modern fantasy elements, painterly illustration, dramatic lighting, highly detailed, sharp focus on the character, soft atmospheric depth in the background.\n\n**Composition:** Medium-shot, slightly low angle, rule of thirds, strong diagonal lines from the sword and the dragon's coil, leading lines from the steps.\n\n**Lighting:** Soft, diffused ambient light from the overcast sky, strong localized light from the glowing red eyes of the dragon and the floating orbs, reflected glow from the sword blade, creating depth and highlights.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Mysterious, powerful, serene yet foreboding, ancient, mystical.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle dragon tail sway. Dragon eyes faintly glow and flicker. Wisps of mist drift. Distant red lights gently flicker. Sword blade subtly ripples and glows. Woman's hair gently shifts. Red hair ribbons delicately sway.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Dragon's tail lashes violently, eyes blazing with explosive bursts of light. Mist swirls into a whirlwind. Distant red lights pulsate wildly, morphing into fiery projectiles. The sword blade pulses with raw energy, emitting aggressive sparks and a blinding glare. The woman's hair whips violently, her red ribbons thrashing as if possessed, her head snapping to face the viewer. Ancient ruins crumble and re-form instantly, rocks levitating, water erupting from the ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The dragon's tail slowly contracts, absorbing the mist into its scales, as its eyes reverse-blink and radiate a purple luminescence that makes the distant red lights surge towards it. The sword's blade pulsates, its glow reflecting the woman's hair, which twists into luminous feathers and slowly rises, pulling the red ribbons into a spiraling vortex while the sword floats upwards, gently lifting the woman from the ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A sweeping crane shot reveals the ancient ruins, focusing on the colossal dragon whose eyes slowly ignite with a fierce glow. The camera dramatically zooms in on the woman’s face, her determined gaze meeting the viewer’s. A tight shot follows her hand as it grips the hilt, the sword's blade shimmering with an ethereal light as she draws it. Wind whips her hair and ribbons, pushing a ghostly mist around her as the dragon lets out a silent roar, its tail swaying powerfully behind her. Blackout.",
