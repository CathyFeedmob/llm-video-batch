    "video_prompt": "Subtle shifts in the smoke and mist around the mechs' feet; gentle flicker of the mechs' internal lights and glowing parts; slight movement of the small human figures as if walking; very slow, almost imperceptible camera pan upwards to reveal more of the large mech's upper body.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, cinematic wide shot of a futuristic metropolis, where towering, sleek brutalist buildings made of reinforced concrete and metal dominate the skyline under a bright, hazy sky. The central focus is a massive, grey-and-blue battle mech, standing over 100 feet tall, its design reminiscent of a blend between Titanfall mechs and Gundam mobile suits, with glowing blue and orange accents. This colossal mech and many other smaller, similarly designed mechs in red, yellow, and green, are walking on expansive, clean industrial platforms.\n\nNumerous human figures, dressed in modern, functional clothing, are scattered across the platforms, walking between the massive mechs, creating a sense of scale and interaction between man and machine. The atmosphere is bright and slightly foggy, with light diffusing from the upper left, casting long, soft shadows and highlighting the metallic surfaces of the structures and mechs. The composition uses leading lines from the architecture and platforms to draw the eye towards the central large mech.\n\nThe color palette consists primarily of cool greys, blues, and concrete tones, contrasted with the glowing accents on the mechs and occasional warm highlights. The lighting is bright and diffuse, typical of an overcast sky or an enormous enclosed space with powerful overhead lights, creating soft reflections on the polished platform surfaces. The overall style is realistic yet stylized, with a strong emphasis on mechanical detail and a futuristic sense of wonder. The depth of field is broad, keeping most elements in focus.\n\nThe foreground features several smaller mechs and human figures, while the background extends into the hazy distance, revealing more colossal structures. The image captures a blend of industrial power and human scale within a futuristic setting. There's a subtle signature \"G29\" in the bottom right corner, suggesting a digital artwork.\n\n**Art Style:** Sci-fi, Mecha anime, Futuristic, Industrial.\n**Lighting:** Bright, diffused, ambient, with subtle dramatic backlighting on the main mech.\n**Mood:** Awe-inspiring, futuristic, busy, grand.\n**Composition:** Dynamic, with a clear focal point, leading lines, and a strong sense of depth.\n**Camera:** Wide-angle, low perspective to emphasize scale.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle ground mist expands. Mech lights softly pulse. Tiny figures edge forward. Camera imperceptibly glides upwards.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Sudden bursts of steam and dust erupt from around the mechs' feet, as if they're about to engage. Internal lights on all mechs intensely flicker, then dramatically brighten. Human figures scatter and run frantically. The camera rapidly zips upwards, violently tilting, revealing the massive mech's eye glowing with destructive energy, hinting at an imminent, catastrophic event.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The ground beneath the mechs' feet liquifies, sending humans and smaller mechs gently floating upwards, the largest mech becoming an anchor in the sky. Its internal lights pulse with an unnatural, hypnotic rhythm, causing its metal to ripple like fabric. Human figures shimmer, their forms dissolving into streams of light that flow into the mech, transforming it into a colossal, crystalline being that slowly ascends into a swirling nebula.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow, upward camera pan begins from human eye-level, revealing towering mechs. Subtle, swirling mists embrace the mechs' powerful feet as internal lights gently pulse, creating an ominous glow. A slow-motion flurry of human movement unfolds below, a silent, awe-struck exodus. The camera continues its majestic ascent, showcasing the immense scale of the largest mech, its upper body emerging into an ethereal industrial gleam.",
