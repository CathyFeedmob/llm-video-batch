    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA futuristic anime-style illustration of a person in a white and pink motorcycle suit riding a sleek white sportbike down a dark, glowing road at high speed. The scene is set in a neon-lit sci-fi city against a dark teal and black night sky. In the upper right background, a ringed planet and another smaller planet are visible. The perspective is from behind and slightly to the right of the rider, looking forward, emphasizing motion and speed.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** A lone rider in a full-body, aerodynamic white and pink motorcycle suit (pink stripes on helmet and back). The rider's posture is dynamic, leaning forward.\n*   **Motorcycle:** A futuristic, sleek, predominantly white sportbike with visible mechanical details, including the rear wheel, chain/belt drive, and engine components.\n*   **Environment:** A futuristic cityscape with tall, sharp-edged buildings and a distinctive, very tall, spired central building. The city glows with teal and magenta lights. The road beneath the bike is dark but shows streaks of bright pink light, indicating speed.\n*   **Sky/Space:** A dark teal/black night sky populated with subtle stars. A prominent ringed planet (similar to Saturn) and a smaller spherical planet are visible in the upper right quadrant.\n*   **Motion:** Streaks of highly saturated pink light emanate from the bike's rear, creating a strong sense of speed. Swirls of dark mist or exhaust are also present near the bottom left.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Anime/Manga inspired:** Clean lines, stylized forms, and a dynamic sense of motion common in anime and cyberpunk art.\n*   **Illustrative:** Hand-drawn aesthetic, not photorealistic.\n*   **High contrast:** Strong separation between light (white bike, neon lights, pink streaks) and dark (sky, shadows).\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Dynamic perspective:** Low angle, from behind the bike, looking forward and slightly upwards towards the horizon and the city.\n*   **Leading lines:** The road, the bike, and the speed streaks all create strong diagonal leading lines, drawing the eye towards the city and the celestial bodies.\n*   **Rule of thirds:** The rider and bike occupy the lower-mid section, while the cityscape fills the mid-ground, and the planets the upper-right.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Palette:** Dark teal, black, white, and vibrant magenta/pink as an accent.\n*   **Highlights:** Bright white on the bike, intense pink for speed streaks and city lights.\n*   **Shadows:** Deep blacks and dark teals, especially in the sky and building silhouettes.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Glowing, ethereal, otherworldly, fast-paced, and slightly mysterious.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Neon glow:** The city buildings emit a soft, diffused teal and magenta light.\n*   **Dynamic backlighting simulations:** The pink speed streaks act as strong, directional light sources.\n*   **Celestial illumination:** Subtle light from the distant planets and stars.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Futuristic and Sci-Fi:** Evokes a sense of advanced technology and space travel.\n*   **Energetic and Fast:** The motion blur and light streaks convey immense speed.\n*   **Cool and Serene:** Despite the speed, the dark and cool color palette gives it a calm, almost contemplative feeling against the vastness of space.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   **Text on image:** Faint Chinese characters in the upper left (\"AI生成\" - AI Generated) and a small red seal/chop in the bottom left. (Consider whether these should be included in the generation, often they are omitted for cleaner results).",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle camera forward zoom. City lights twinkle, distant planet rings shimmer. Exhaust glow pulses, fumes drift. Rider's clothing subtly shifts. Slight lens flare from highlights.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "**Dynamic Prompt:**\n\nThe cityscape explodes forward, buildings violently pitching, their lights frenetically strobing. The planet's rings warp and contort, its surface rippling with chaotic energy. Exhaust plumes erupt into blazing jets, igniting the air as the rider's suit violently shatters and reforms with each lurch. Ground beneath disintegrates into a blinding, streaking vortex. Sudden lens flares erupt like miniature supernovas.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The biker races backward, exhaust fumes forming shimmering stars that fly into the engine. The city rotates slowly into the sky, buildings dissolving into liquid light. Saturn's rings spiral inward, drawing the planet into a swirling vortex. The rider's suit transforms from a sleek uniform into flowing ribbons of cosmic energy, trailing behind as they accelerate into the impossible.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "**Video Prompt:** \n\nA low-angle tracking shot follows the speeding motorcycle, tires kicking up glowing pink dust. The camera subtly zooms forward, revealing the rider's intense focus. As the bike accelerates, the city lights shimmer and a distant ringed planet pulsates with ethereal light. The exhaust flares dramatically, casting dynamic shadows, before a sudden, sweeping crane shot lifts to reveal the rider silhouetted against the cosmic cyberpunk cityscape.",
