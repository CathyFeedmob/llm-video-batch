    "video_prompt": "Subtle neon flickers and glows on buildings. Pedestrians subtly shift and sway with minor head turns. Hovering crafts drift slightly and emit soft, pulsing light from their engines. The robot's eyes emit a subtle, internal glow. The street lights reflect subtly on the wet ground. Slight camera pan and zoom.",
    "image_prompt": "A cyberpunk cityscape at night, looking up from a busy street level. Towering, futuristic skyscrapers dominate the background, illuminated by glowing neon lines and countless windows, creating a sense of immense verticality. The buildings feature sleek, dark architecture with integrated vertical and horizontal light strips in various colors like blue, purple, and orange.\n\nIn the mid-ground, multiple small, dark grey, futuristic flying vehicles or drones with glowing blue engines are seen in motion, navigating between the buildings. Many large digital billboards displaying a prominent white Bitcoin symbol against vibrant neon backgrounds (blue, orange, purple) are attached to the buildings on either side of the street. Some billboards are also showing other futuristic-looking logos.\n\nThe foreground depicts a bustling street scene. On the left, several sleek, modern cars with glowing blue or white headlights and minimalist designs are parked or moving slowly. One car in the immediate foreground, a silver sports car, has particularly bright blue light strips. Standing next to the cars, a tall, imposing humanoid robot with a metallic grey and black body and a glowing blue head/visor is visible. On the right, and extending into the mid-ground, a crowd of diverse people, some wearing translucent raincoats, walk away from the viewer on a dark, reflective street. The street itself has glowing orange lines embedded in its surface, guiding the eye.\n\nThe overall color palette is dominated by dark, cool tones (blues, grays) contrasted with bright, saturated neon lights (electric blue, deep purple, vibrant orange, some hints of pink and green). The lighting is dramatic and atmospheric, casting long reflections on the wet-looking street and highlighting the futuristic elements. The composition features a strong central vanishing point, drawing the viewer's eye upwards and into the distance, emphasizing the scale of the city. The atmosphere is bustling, advanced, and slightly dystopian.",

    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Buildings violently pulsate with blinding neon bursts. Pedestrians lurch, stumble, and fall, their heads snapping in unnatural directions. Hovering crafts careen wildly, engines flaring with explosive light as they crash and explode. The robotâ€™s eyes blaze with an infernal, expanding glow, its body suddenly animating and stomping forward. Streetlights erupt, casting erratic, dancing reflections on the surging, churning ground. The camera whips and zooms like a predator.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Buildings ripple like liquid, neon bleeding into the sky. Pedestrians melt into swirling light, their forms elongating and twisting. Hovering craft invert, defying gravity as they rise diagonally, engines humming backwards. The robot's eyes become swirling galaxies. Streetlights bloom into ethereal tendrils, reabsorbing their reflections from the now-dry asphalt. The camera itself dissolves, reforming as a flock of iridescent butterflies.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera dramatically zooms out from a vibrant billboard, revealing the bustling neon city. Pedestrians flow like a river, some turning to gaze skyward as a hovering craft swoops down, its engine pulsing intensely before it ascends again. The camera pans to a robot, its internal eyes igniting with a sharp, bright glow as it subtly turns its head. Streetlights reflect brilliantly on the slick ground, creating a dynamic, mirrored effect.",
