  "video_prompt": "Massive monstrous creature, glowing orange eyes, snarling, actively dripping dark liquid. Lava-like substance aggressively streams across the road. Scattered debris shifts. Vehicles are abandoned. Pedestrians move away rapidly then halt, observing. Traffic lights flicker.",
  "image_prompt": "Digital painting of a massive, rock-skinned monster with glowing orange eyes and bared teeth, resembling a Hulk variation, crouched on a city street. Dark liquid drips from its mouth and chest. Molten red liquid streams across the asphalt near scattered traffic cones. Cars, white crosswalk lines, buildings, people on sidewalks, and traffic signals fill the urban background under daylight. Painterly style with muted earthy tones contrasted by vibrant monster details and fiery liquid.",
