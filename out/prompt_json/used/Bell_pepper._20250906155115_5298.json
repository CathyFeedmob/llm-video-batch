The pepper's interior is textured, lighter green. Beyond it, a welcoming bedroom with a grey upholstered bed, white bedding, and a light green throw. A white console table with teal vases, blue candlesticks, and yellow potted plants sits left, under two framed artworks. A tall white floor lamp hangs above. To the right, another yellow potted plant on a white stool, a wall-mounted light, and another artwork. The bedroom's palette is earthy greens, yellows, and natural wood. The pepper arch is surrounded by abundant green foliage: broad palm leaves and smaller leafy plants. Trailing vines cascade from above, casting leaf shadows on the light blue-grey wall. The dark wooden foreground features vibrant clusters of purple, orange, and reddish-orange flowers. Warm lighting creates a subtle sheen on the floor, reflecting the environment.
