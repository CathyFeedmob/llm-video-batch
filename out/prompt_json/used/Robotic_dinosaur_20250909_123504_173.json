    "video_prompt": "The blue glowing elements on the robot subtly pulse and flicker. The camera slowly zooms in on the robot.",
    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, intricate, and rugged-looking **bionic beast** or **mech creature**, resembling a sabretooth tiger or large feline, in a dynamic pose, possibly crouched or stalking.\n\n**Visual Elements and Texture:**\n*   Prominently features **exposed mechanical parts** rendered with fine detail: gears, pistons, wires, tubes, bolts, and interlocking plates.\n*   The surface should primarily be **weathered metal**, showing signs of wear, scratches, and possibly rust or patina, giving it an aged, battle-hardened appearance.\n*   **Glows of vibrant cyan/electric blue light** emanate from various openings, internal mechanisms (like the eye-sockets, mouth, and circular vents on the body), and integrated light strips. These lights should have a slightly flickering or pulsating quality.\n*   **Sharp, pointed claws and teeth** made of metal are clearly visible.\n*   The creature's head has a sleek, predatory shape with integrated sensors or \"eyes.\"\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Sci-fi/Cyberpunk mixed with Steampunk/Dieselpunk aesthetics.** A balance between advanced machinery and rugged, industrial design.\n*   **Comic book or graphic novel art style:** Strong, clean lines with bold inking and distinct shading. Not photorealistic, but highly illustrative.\n*   **Highly intricate and detailed**, with a focus on mechanical fidelity rather than organic smoothness.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Close-up, medium shot**, focusing on the creature's upper body and head, angled slightly from below to emphasize its imposing nature.\n*   The creature is positioned on a **rugged, rocky precipice or ancient ruins**, with some of the foreground elements (like its claws and part of its arm) extending towards the viewer.\n*   The background is slightly out of focus but suggests a **vast, desolate, or alien environment** with distant structures, possibly weathered architecture or natural formations.\n*   A subtle, ghostly number \"C-29\" is visible in the background, adding a mysterious codex element.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   Predominantly **cool color palette**: various shades of **greys and dark blues/teals** for the metal body, contrasting with the luminous **cyan/electric blue** light.\n*   Subtle hints of **desaturated olive green or tarnished brass/bronze** on some metal components to add depth and wear.\n*   Background colors are deep, muted teals and blues, creating depth and a sense of atmosphere.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Dramatic and moody backlighting** and **rim lighting** from the prominent blue internal glows.\n*   Some areas will be in deep shadow, emphasizing the contours and adding to the imposing feel.\n*   The cyan glows cast subtle light onto surrounding metal surfaces.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Gritty, powerful, and mysterious.**\n*   A sense of advanced technology within a decaying or ancient world.\n*   Slightly ominous or watchful, giving the creature a sense of latent power.\n\n**Overall Impression:** A captivating blend of mechanical complexity and primal power, rendered in a striking, detailed graphic style.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The robot's blue glowing elements subtly pulse and flicker. The camera gradually draws closer.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Giant robot's glowing elements surge, intensifying with each metallic shriek! It leaps forward, claws scraping stone, eyes blazing. Gears grind violently, steam explodes from joints as it lunges. The camera whips around, disoriented by its sudden, monstrous speed. Ancient stone crumbles underfoot, dust churning into a vortex. Energy arcs wildly from its core, threatening to engulf the frame!",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Gravity-defying cables writhe, pulling the robot's glowing elements into impossible configurations. Gears morph into liquid light, flowing across its metallic shell as its form distorts, dissolving into a shimmering, blue energy vortex. The “629” inscription detaches, spiraling backward into the nascent void as the camera, now untethered, plunges further into the collapsing reality.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A low-angle shot reveals the colossal steampunk robot. The camera slowly zooms in, tracking the mesmerizing pulse of its blue internal glows. It then subtly pans up, following the robot's head as it sharply turns towards an unseen, distant object. The blue glows intensify, casting an eerie light as the robot slowly steps forward, one massive clawed foot slamming down, sending subtle vibrations through the ground.",
