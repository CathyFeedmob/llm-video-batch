  "video_prompt": "Girl's head tilts up, eyes tracking falling rain. Rain streaks down, reflecting neon city lights off her jacket. Her fingers shift on a guitar's fretboard. Water droplets slide across her face, hands, and the guitar body.  Blurs of colorful light expand and contract in the background.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:**\n\nVertical full-shot, realistic anime-style digital illustration of a young girl with grey/blonde hair and blue/turquoise eyes, looking skyward in the rain on a night city street. She wears a black studded leather jacket, reflecting neon lights (pink, purple, blue, green). She holds a red electric guitar. The background is a blurry, rainy city with diffuse neon lights. Dynamic raindrops and reflections. Mood: introspective, artistic, urban fantasy.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Girl's head smoothly tilts skyward, her eyes tracking descending rain. Rain streaks dynamically, with neon city reflections shimmering and shifting across her jacket. Her fingers subtly reposition on the guitar fretboard. Water droplets actively slide and trail across her skin and the guitar's surface. In the background, colorful light blurs fluidly expand and contract."
