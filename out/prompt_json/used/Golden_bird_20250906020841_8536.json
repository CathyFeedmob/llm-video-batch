  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** A magical, full-length vertical image of a small, sparkly, white and gold bird perched on a human finger. The bird has delicate, translucent white feathers with shimmering gold accents, tiny glitter-like specks, dark bead eyes, a soft gold beak, and a slight feather crest. Its right wing is outstretched, and its feathers and tail are outlined in brilliant gold. The tips of its tiny, clawed feet are also gold. The human finger with visible fingerprint ridges perches the bird, with another partially visible finger in the bottom left. The background is a deep, dark teal, resembling a mysterious night sky, with numerous soft golden and amber circular bokeh lights and smaller, sharper star-like glints. A \"C29\" gold logo with a small green and white circle is in the bottom right corner. Emphasize delicate beauty, magic, and wonder with the shimmering bird as the focal point.",
