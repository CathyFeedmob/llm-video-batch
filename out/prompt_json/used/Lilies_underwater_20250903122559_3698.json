  "video_prompt": "Underwater, sunlight shimmers through a dynamic water surface, dappling on lily pad undersides and vertically swaying stems. Bubbles ascend. Aquatic plants undulate from a textured, rocky bed. Subtle currents shift hues from teal to deep blue.",
  "image_prompt": "**Prompt:** Underwater perspective looking up at shimmering sunlight filtering through a freshwater pond, illuminating the undersides of vibrant green water lily pads with visible veins and their long stems. Clear blue water with subtle gradients, a rocky bed with smooth stones, and dense clusters of other aquatic plants. Include small bubbles near the surface and unique translucent bluish-white circular shapes on the foreground rocks. Serene, tranquil, and immersive, with high detail and realistic lighting, hinting at a healthy ecosystem.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Shimmering light continuously dances and shifts across the water surface, dappling lily pad undersides. Stems gently sway upwards. Bubbles steadily ascend.
