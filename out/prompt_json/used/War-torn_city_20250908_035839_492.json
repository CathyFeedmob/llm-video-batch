    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that could recreate the provided image:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nLong shot, post-apocalyptic urban warzone at sunset. In the foreground, a damaged, leaning utility pole with multiple wires extends diagonally from the upper left, while the wreckage of a building with exposed rebar and concrete debris fills the lower left and bottom right. In the middle ground, lines of small military tanks or armored vehicles advance across a wide, dusty, barren landscape towards the right. Scattered debris, small fires, and red flags (some mounted on poles) are visible between the tanks. In the background, a heavily damaged city skyline is silhouetted against the sky, with multiple buildings on fire and emitting thick plumes of dark smoke that rise and spread across the sky. The largest fire is centrally located in the background, casting an orange glow.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n* **Subject:** Military tanks, leaning utility pole, urban ruins, city skyline, fires, smoke.\n* **Objects:** utility pole, wires, rebar, concrete debris, armored vehicles, red flags, damaged buildings.\n\n**Style:** Realistic, gritty, post-apocalyptic, war photography.\n\n**Composition:**\n* **Foreground:** Leaning utility pole from upper left to middle, building wreckage lower left and bottom right.\n* **Midground:** Advancing columns of tanks, debris, flags. Creates depth and linear perspective.\n* **Background:** Burned city skyline, large fires, heavy smoke, establishing the warzone setting.\n* **Point of View:** Slightly elevated, looking down and across the ruined landscape.\n* **Angle:** Slight Dutch tilt from the leaning pole, suggesting instability and chaos.\n\n**Colors:**\n* **Dominant:** Desaturated earth tones â€“ browns, grays, muted blues (sky), and dusty beige for the ground.\n* **Accents:** Bright oranges and reds from fires, deep black/dark gray from smoke clouds. Subtle warm light from the setting sun.\n\n**Lighting:**\n* **Source:** Setting sun (or rising sun) from the upper left, casting warm, golden light on clouds and some foreground elements.\n* **Effect:** Creates dramatic silhouettes of the city and smoke, contrast between the illuminated sky and darker foreground wreckage. Fires provide self-illumination.\n* **Atmosphere:** Hazy, dusty, smoky, with an oppressive and desolate feel.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Devastated, war-torn, grim, desolate, chaotic, impactful, a sense of ongoing conflict.\n\nThis prompt is designed to capture the key elements and overall mood of the original image for a text-to-image generation model.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Subtle smoke drifts from the fire and distant buildings. Light rays subtly shift through clouds. Tank tracks slowly roll, emitting minor exhaust. Distant flags gently sway.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Wreckage groans and shifts, dust clouds billow violently from impacts, not fire. Tanks surge forward, barrels swiveling with aggressive intent.  Flames erupt from unseen explosions, consuming structures in dynamic bursts, casting chaotic shadows. The sky darkens, thunderheads roil aggressively, unleashing torrents. Red flags snap erratically in violent winds, signaling imminent danger.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Distorted sky reflects upside-down city as tanks float upwards like balloons. Flames rise from the ground, swirling into smoke wisps that coalesce into shimmering clouds. Flags dissolve into fluttering butterflies. Buildings subtly ripple and melt, their rebar skeleton transforming into fluid, glowing vines. The ground gently undulates, absorbing and releasing the floating debris.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera sweeps across a devastated cityscape, revealing a convoy of tanks advancing through the rubble-filled streets. Distant buildings smolder, fire illuminating the ominous sky. As the camera zooms past a shattered communication pole, subtle smoke wisps from the destruction. Flags on the horizon flutter gently in the warm, dusty breeze, while exhaust haze trails from the constantly moving tanks. The scene is bathed in the dramatic glow of a setting sun.",
