    "video_prompt": "The following is a video generation prompt based on the provided image:\n\nGolden particles subtly shimmer and drift downwards through the hourglass's upper chamber and softly accumulate in the lower one. Smaller golden specks gently float and sparkle in the air around the cityscape. The large golden objects suspended in the sky subtly bob and glint with light. People in the foreground subtly shift weight and breathe, with light reflecting gently on the glossy golden ground.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt for recreating the provided image, focusing on visual elements, style, composition, colors, lighting, and atmosphere:\n\n**Central Theme:** A futuristic cityscape infused with golden, time-related elements and a slightly surreal, dreamlike quality.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A grand, wide-angle shot of a futuristic city square under a bright, clear sky. Dominated on the right by a massive, towering hourglass filled with flowing golden glitter or sand, shimmering brightly. Scattered throughout the sky, and especially prominent in the foreground and near the hourglass, are numerous floating, sparkling golden diamond-shaped crystals or hour-glass like pods, some appearing to drip golden dust.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:**\n*   **Foreground:** A large group of diverse people gathered in the square, viewed from behind or at a slight distance, creating a sense of scale. The ground is a highly reflective surface (like polished marble or water), shimmering intensely with scattered golden particles and reflecting the city, sky, and golden elements above.\n*   **Midground:** The base of the gigantic hourglass on the right, with the lower half of its golden sand visible. The square is bustling with more people, and several large, elegant sun umbrellas or awnings provide shade.\n*   **Background:** A sprawling, modern cityscape with towering, spired skyscrapers and office buildings, some featuring reflective glass facades or glowing neon accents (e.g., blue outlines). The buildings have a sleek, clean, and somewhat ornate or fantastical design.\n*   **Framing:** On the left, the golden, ornate balconies and detailed facade of a multi-story building frame the scene, hinting at intricate architecture.\n\n**Style & Atmosphere:**\n*   **Genre:** Futuristic, fantasy, surreal, utopian.\n*   **Mood:** Majestic, awe-inspiring, serene, and subtly intriguing.\n*   **Lighting:** Bright, ethereal sunlight that casts long, soft shadows and highlights the golden elements with a brilliant glow. Strong reflections are visible on the ground. The light feels like late afternoon or early morning, with a soft golden hour quality in the distance.\n*   **Color Palette:** Dominated by warm golden tones (for the sand, crystals, and reflections), vibrant sky blues, and muted greens/browns for the people and some architectural elements. Strong contrasts between the golden light and the blue sky/watery reflections.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   **Golden Elements:** The golden sand/glitter within the hourglass and the floating diamond/pod shapes should be highly reflective and appear to sparkle, suggesting preciousness or energy.\n*   **People:** Diverse group, casually dressed, largely viewed from the back, adding to the scale and focus on the scenery.\n*   **Reflections:** Crucial for the ground â€“ show clear, luminous reflections of the golden elements, buildings, and sky. The scattered golden particles on the ground should look like a scattered path of shimmering jewels.\n*   **Sky:** Clear azure sky with minimal, wispy clouds near the horizon.\n\n**Overall Impression:** A breathtaking and imaginative blend of time, wealth, and futuristic urban life, rendered with stunning detail and vibrant luminescence.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Golden particles continuously fall inside the hourglass, shimmering as they settle. Delicate golden flecks drift and twinkle across the cityscape. Large golden objects in the sky gently sway and reflect light. People subtly shift their stance and chests rise and fall, with soft light reflections moving on the golden ground.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The hourglass shatters, golden particles erupting violently upwards, forming a swirling vortex in the sky. Massive golden objects crash through buildings, sending debris flying. The ground violently cracks and golden liquid bursts forth, engulfing the frantic, sprinting crowd in a blinding, explosive cascade. Buildings contort and twist.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "Golden particles and shimmering liquid in the hourglass flow *upwards* and *spill out*, defying gravity. Huge golden objects in the sky *grow and shrink*, pulsating as golden liquid drips *up* from the ground into them. Reflections on the ground *ripple and distort*, showing alternate cityscapes. People levitate slightly, their forms subtly *blurring and reforming* in a shimmering golden glow.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A dramatic, slow-motion push-in on the hourglass reveals golden particles cascading with increasing speed. The camera then sweeps up, following a particularly large, radiant golden object descending gracefully, its glow intensifying as it passes grand futuristic spires. A man in the foreground dramatically turns his head, his face illuminated by the falling gold, as the glossy ground reflects the shimmering spectacle in a mesmerizing, liquid-like dance of light.",
