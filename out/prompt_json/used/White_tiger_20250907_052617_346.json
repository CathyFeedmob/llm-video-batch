    "video_prompt": "The white tiger breathes subtly, its fur gently rippling with the movement. The mystical smoke surrounding it billows softly, and faint wisps of illuminated energy pulsate around its paws. Tiny, scattered particles drift slowly through the air, adding depth to the mystical atmosphere.",
    "image_prompt": "Here's a detailed image generation prompt that could recreate the provided image of the white tiger:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A majestic and powerful white tiger, centered and aggressively charging towards the viewer. Its mouth is open in a roar, revealing fangs and pink gums. Its eyes are striking light blue, intense and focused. The tiger has distinct black stripes, with the iconic \"wang\" (king) character pattern visible on its forehead. Its fur is shaggy and textured, especially around the face. One front paw is heavily emitting bright blue and purple ethereal energy/magic, creating glowing sparks and wisps of mist/smoke around it as if it's supernaturally charged. The other paws also show subtle hints of this energy.\n\n**Enviornment/Background:** The tiger is emerging from a swirling, voluminous cloud of white and light purple mist or fog, which trails behind and around its body, indicating swift movement. The background is a mystical, serene, and slightly hazy mountain landscape, depicted in cool, muted tones of grey-green and light blue, suggesting early morning or late evening. Distant, jagged mountains are visible, with sparse, gnarled, dark trees clinging to rocky outcrops, adding to an ancient, ethereal atmosphere. Small, faint white particles or snow-like effects are sparsely scattered in the air, hinting at a cold, high-altitude setting.\n\n**Composition:** Full shot of the tiger, with its head and upper body slightly dominating the frame. Dynamic composition with the tiger charging directly forward, creating a sense of urgency and power. The foreground shows only the tiger. The background recedes into a soft, atmospheric blur.\n\n**Lighting:** Ethereal and mystical lighting. The main light source appears to be originating from within the tiger itself, particularly from the glowing energy on its paw. This creates a soft, self-illuminated glow on the tiger's fur, highlighting its white and blue features. The overall scene has a soft, diffused light, suggesting a cloudy or foggy day, but with brighter illumination around the tiger due to its magical aura. Blue and purple hues are prominent in the energy and misty effects.\n\n**Style:** Realistic yet stylized, with elements of fantasy art. Highly detailed fur and facial features on the tiger. A painterly quality, especially in the background, with a soft focus. Evokes a sense of grandeur, power, and ancient magic. Cinematic and dramatic.\n\n**Color Palette:** Dominated by cool tones: whites, light greys, muted blues, and hints of lavender/purple in the magical energy and mist. Black for stripes, light blue for eyes, a touch of pink for the nose and inner mouth. Greens from the distant foliage are desaturated.\n\n**Mood/Atmosphere:** Powerful, mysterious, majestic, and awe-inspiring, with a touch of the supernatural.\n\n**Additional details for enhancement:**\n* Hyper-realistic fur detail.\n* Dynamic motion blur around the tiger's body to enhance the charging effect.\n* Subtle luminescence around the tiger's outline as it interacts with the mist.\n* A strong sense of depth, with the tiger popping out from the misty background.\n* High resolution, intricate details.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The white tiger's chest rises and falls with each breath, its fur subtly shifting. The surrounding mystical smoke billows and swirls gently. Faint, luminous energy pulsates around its paws. Tiny, scattered particles drift and float slowly through the air.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The white tiger roars, launching forward as its fur violently erupts with swirling energy. Mystical smoke explodes from its body, transforming into a torrent of ethereal flames that lash out. Bolts of incandescent energy surge from its paws, striking the ground with forceful impacts, as ancient mountains dramatically shift and crack.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The white tiger, mid-roar, shimmers, its fur replaced by swirling starlight as the \"mystical smoke\" condenses into solid, reflective mirrors, shattering and reforming around it. Its glowing paws phase through dimensional portals, materializing as ethereal bird wings that beat impossibly, pulling the tiger skyward. The \"scattered particles\" flow backward, forming an inverted waterfall of pure light, while the mountains in the background ripple like water, revealing glimpses of a cosmic void.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "The camera slowly orbits the white tiger, its glowing eyes locking onto the frame. As the tiger inhales, the mystical smoke around it briefly condenses before exploding outwards, revealing a powerful roar. A sweeping zoom-in highlights the vibrating claws as glowing energy pulses intensely around its paws, then a quick pan follows a single particle of energy as it gracefully drifts upward, disappearing into the misty mountains.",
