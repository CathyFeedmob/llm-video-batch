  "video_prompt": "A person diligently writes or draws at a desk, their hands moving purposefully over papers. Their head subtly tilts or shifts, reflecting deep focus. The warm desk lamp casts a gentle, flickering glow on their workspace. Through the large window, a moonlit forest background subtly alters as trees sway in a faint breeze. Stars faintly twinkle in the deep blue sky. Clouds slowly drift across the luminous full moon, causing its ethereal glow to momentarily dim and then brighten again, transforming the outdoor scene.",
  "image_prompt": "Here are a few options, from more detailed to super concise:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Evocative):**\n\"A person works diligently at a cluttered wooden desk, seen from behind, late at night. The desk is brightly lit by a warm, yellow desk lamp, surrounded by books and papers. Through a large window behind them, a luminous full moon hangs in a deep teal night sky with scattered stars, casting an ethereal glow over a dense, silhouetted evergreen forest. The warm, cozy interior light contrasts with the cool, tranquil moonlit exterior. Mood: quiet contemplation, focused work, solitude, atmospheric mystery. Cinematic lighting.\"\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise):**\n\"Late night scene: Person working at a warm, lamp-lit wooden desk, seen from behind. Large window overlooks a stunning, moonlit, silhouetted evergreen forest under a deep teal sky with a prominent full moon. Warm interior light vs. cool exterior moonlight. Quiet, focused, atmospheric.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Super Concise - focusing on core visual contrast):**\n\"From behind: A person working at a warm, lamp-lit desk. Large window view of a dramatic, moonlit forest and full moon in a deep teal night sky. Warm indoor glow, cool outdoor serenity. Solitude, focus.\"",
  "refined_video_prompt": "Hands move purposefully over papers as a person writes or draws, their head subtly tilting or shifting with focused expression. A desk lamp's glow gently flickers. Outside, moonlit trees sway in a faint breeze, while stars faintly twinkle.
