    "video_prompt": "A subtle shimmer emanates from the glowing flora, their petals gently pulsating with light. The transparent butterflies slowly flap their wings, occasionally drifting through the air. The ethereal butterflies within the glass sphere subtly dance and twirl. The reflective floor softly ripples with the changing light, mirroring the glowing elements above. Small motes of light subtly drift through the air. A very subtle, slow upward camera movement.",
    "image_prompt": "An enchanting, futuristic botanical garden housed inside a large, glass-domed structure, possibly a biodome or conservatory.\n\n**Visual Elements and Style:**\n*   **Structure:** The dominant feature is the modern, intricate glass and metal framework of the dome, creating geometric patterns overhead. There are also darker, metallic beams and structures, some with embedded neon-like lights, creating an artificial yet organic feel.\n*   **Foliage:** Lush greenery is abundant, with various tropical-looking plants, broad leaves, and winding vines, suggesting a vibrant, thriving ecosystem.\n*   **Pathway:** A reflective, light-emitting pathway or floor stretches towards a central, glowing spherical tunnel. The reflections on the floor suggest a wet or highly polished surface.\n*   **Orbs/Tunnels:** A prominent spherical structure with concentric, glowing rings forms an entrance to a glowing tunnel, creating a portal-like effect. This structure is transparent, allowing light and butterflies to be seen through it.\n*   **Flora & Fauna:**\n    *   **Glowing Butterflies:** Large, luminous butterflies with translucent, glowing wings in shades of pink, purple, and blue are scattered throughout the scene, some appearing to be part of the flora (like flower-butterflies).\n    *   **Luminous Flowers:** Several glowing, stylized flowers in various vivid colors (pink, yellow, blue, purple) emit light from their petals, some with delicate stems that appear almost liquid.\n    *   **Butterflies:** In addition to the large glowing ones, smaller, regular butterflies of various colors (including white, orange, pink) are seen flying around, particularly in the upper dome area.\n*   **Figures:** In the distance, at the end of the glowing tunnel, several silhouetted figures can be seen, suggesting human presence or visitors.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Perspective:** The image is taken from a slightly low, eye-level perspective, looking down a wide pathway towards the central spherical structure and onward into the glowing tunnel.\n*   **Symmetry/Asymmetry:** While there's a strong central axis along the pathway, the surrounding foliage and glowing elements are somewhat asymmetrically arranged, creating a natural balance.\n*   **Depth:** The overlapping layers of greenery, the distant figures, and the receding tunnel create a sense of deep perspective.\n*   **Framing:** The dome's structure and overhead foliage act as a natural frame for the scene.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Dominant Hues:** A rich palette dominated by cool blues and vibrant teals, especially for the distant foliage and sky seen through the dome.\n*   **Accents:** Pinks, purples, yellows, and oranges for the glowing butterflies and flowers provide striking contrast. White and muted greens for other scattered butterflies and foliage.\n*   **Lighting:** Strong glowing light from the internal structures (rings, pathway, flowers, butterflies) contrasts with the softer, ambient light filtering through the dome. The scene has an ethereal, otherworldly glow.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Luminosity:** The most striking lighting element is the internal glow from the artificial structures and bioluminescent flora/fauna.\n*   **Halo Effect:** A soft glowing \"halo\" or aura surrounds many of the luminous elements.\n*   **Reflections:** Significant reflections of the glowing elements on the pathway and the glass structures.\n*   **Overall:** Dreamlike, magical, and futuristic.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Fantasy/Sci-Fi:** A blend of natural beauty with advanced technology, creating a magical and futuristic ambiance.\n*   **Serene and Immersive:** The soft lighting, vibrant colors, and natural elements evoke a sense of calm and wonder.\n*   **Ethereal/Dreamlike:** The glowing elements and translucent forms contribute to an otherworldly and mystical feel.\n\n**Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n```\nA hyperrealistic, immersive wide shot of a breathtaking futuristic biodome, a glowing greenhouse filled with bioluminescent flora and fauna, under a vast glass-and-metal domed ceiling. The dominant color palette is cool blues, teals, and dark greens, accentuated by vibrant pink, purple, and yellow light. A reflective, luminescent pathway extends forward, reflecting vivid glows. The path leads to a large, transparent spherical portal with concentric glowing rings of blue light, acting as an entrance to a distant, ethereal blue-lit tunnel where silhouetted figures are visible. Surrounding the pathway are lush, tropical plants with broad leaves and winding vines. Numerous glowing butterflies with translucent, illuminated wings in pinks, purples, and blues float around, some appearing rooted in the ground like luminous flowers. Other bioluminescent flowers in pink, yellow, blue, and purple emit soft light from their petals, their intricate stems also subtly glowing. Smaller, colorful butterflies (white, orange, pink) flutter higher up towards the domed ceiling, which showcases intricate geometric patterns of metal and glass, offering glimpses of vibrant blue, stylized trees outside. The lighting is magical and dreamlike, with soft glows emanating from the flora and architectural elements, creating vibrant reflections on the polished floor. The overall atmosphere is one of serene wonder and futuristic fantasy. Ray tracing, octane render, volumetric lighting, unreal engine 5.\n```",
    "refined_video_prompt": "Glowing flora subtly shimmer and pulse. Transparent butterflies gently flap and drift. Ethereal butterflies within the sphere subtly dance and twirl. The reflective floor softly ripples, mirroring movement. Small light motes subtly drift. Camera slowly moves upward.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "The glowing flora *violently* pulsates, petals thrashing and shedding bright sparks. Transparent butterflies *burst* into manic flight, swarming and colliding. Ethereal butterflies *explode* from the glass sphere, dissolving into blinding flashes. The reflective floor *shatters* and reconstitutes, violently mirroring the chaotic light. Motes of light *erupt* into explosive streaks, ripping skyward as the camera *rockets* upward through the pandemonium.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "The glowing flora's petals softly breathe, their luminescence drawing in transparent butterflies that melt into spectral color trails as they flutter. Within the sphere, ethereal butterflies shatter and reform, their fragments briefly reflecting on the floor, which then liquifies, its mirrored surface flowing upwards like reversed rain. Light motes coalesce then explode into new, impossibly solid butterflies that reform, flying backward into the liquid floor.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A breathtaking cinematic journey into a bioluminescent wonderland. The camera slowly tracks upward past neon flora, revealing translucent butterflies drifting. A subtle zoom-in draws us towards a colossal glowing sphere, within which ethereal butterflies dance. As the camera dramatically pulls back, the reflective floor shimmers, mirroring the shifting lights. A final, sweeping move upwards reveals the vast, enclosed ecosystem, creating a sense of grandeur and awe.",
