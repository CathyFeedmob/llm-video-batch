  "video_prompt": "A quaint building transforms its exterior: Vines grow and recede. Umbrellas open and close. A bird flutters, then flies away. Petals and leaves drift down, landing on the water and ground, then vanishing. Water ripples subtly in a channel. A sign appears, then disappears, with text changing.",
  "image_prompt": "A charming watercolor painting of a two-story caf\u00e9/shop with a balcony, featuring a green tree, pink awning, and shelves of bottles. Vines adorn the facade. The lower level has white stone arches, a serene blue-green water channel, and abundant potted plants. The style is light and airy, with visible brushstrokes, showing the white of the paper, and includes decorative scribbled text, color splatters, and hanging lanterns. Elements like a chalkboard, outdoor seating, and small details like floating petals and a bird create a peaceful, inviting atmosphere reminiscent of a quaint European street scene.",

  "refined_video_prompt": "Exterior alterations unfold. Vines visibly propagate and retract across the facade. Umbrellas unfurl and collapse. A bird flutters into view, then departs. Petals and leaves drift down, settling, then dissipate from surfaces. Water subtly ripples in a channel. A sign materializes, its text dynamically changing, before it vanishes."
