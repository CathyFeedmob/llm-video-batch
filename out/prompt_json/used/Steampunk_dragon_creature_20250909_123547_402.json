    "video_prompt": "A majestic steampunk dragon in flight, its massive mechanical wings subtly adjusting. Slight steam wisps from various vents and pipes on its brass-laden body. Its glowing eyes blink slowly, as if observing the world. The clouds in the background drift lazily, and a distant bird subtly shifts its position in the sky. The camera has a very subtle, almost imperceptible, slow zoom out.",
    "image_prompt": "A full body shot of a colossal, steampunk-inspired dragon, heavily armored and equipped with intricate machinery on its back, standing on a rocky outcrop looking towards the right side of the frame. The dragon has exposed teeth with multiple glowing eyes on its head, and large, mechanical wings. The scene is set under a clear sky with a few birds in the distance.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n*   **Subject:** A gigantic, fearsome dragon.\n*   **Details:** The dragon's body is covered in detailed, segmented armor, reminiscent of scales and plating. Its back is adorned with complex steampunk machinery, including gears, pipes, gauges, smokestacks, and glowing green elements suggesting power sources or eyes. Its head features multiple eyes (some natural, some mechanical and glowing amber), sharp teeth, and horns. Its powerful limbs end in large, clawed hands and feet, with visible muscles and intricate ankle and wrist wraps. A long, segmented tail trails behind it. The wings are large, bat-like, and appear to be made of rigid, segmented material with visible struts and mechanisms.\n*   **Background:** A bright, clear sky with a soft gradient from light blue at the top to a warm, pale yellow/orange near the horizon. Small, silhouetted birds are visible in the sky. In the far distance, faint structures and landmasses suggest a vast, open landscape.\n*   **Foreground:** The dragon stands on a prominent rocky outcrop or cliff edge. Below and to the left, a rudimentary wooden platform or scaffolding is visible. The dragon's tail curls along the ground.\n\n**Style:**\n*   **Art Style:** Highly detailed, illustrative, comic book or graphic novel aesthetic with a strong emphasis on line art and solid, bold coloring. The style is reminiscent of dieselpunk or steampunk fantasy.\n*   **Render Quality:** High-quality illustration with clean lines and sharp details.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   **Framing:** Vertical full-shot, with the dragon filling a significant portion of the frame, from its tail in the lower left to its wingtips extending towards the top right.\n*   **Perspective:** Low-angle shot, emphasizing the dragon's imposing size and power, looking slightly up at it.\n*   **Arrangement:** The dragon is positioned centrally, but its head and forward body are angled towards the right, creating a sense of movement or observation. The wings spread diagonally across the upper portion of the frame.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The dragon's head is roughly aligned with the upper right intersection point, while its body traverses the middle section.\n\n**Colors:**\n*   **Palette:** Predominantly warm, earthy tones.\n*   **Dragon:** Rich browns, rusted oranges, and dark metallics for the armor and machinery. Creamy off-whites and light browns for exposed skin/scales. Luminous green accents on the machinery and amber glows for some of the mechanical eyes.\n*   **Wings:** Dark orange-brown for the membrane, dark brown and black for the mechanical struts.\n*   **Sky:** Soft light blue fading to pale yellow/orange.\n*   **Ground:** Dark browns, grays, and muted greens for the rock and vegetation.\n*   **Highlights:** Bright highlights on metallic surfaces, indicating strong ambient light.\n\n**Lighting:**\n*   **Direction:** Appears to be from the upper left, casting distinct shadows on the dragon's underside, the machinery, and the shadowed parts of the wings.\n*   **Quality:** Bright, clear, and uniform, suggesting an open outdoor setting during the day. Strong contrasts between lit and shadowed areas enhance detail and depth.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n*   **Mood:** Epic, grand, powerful, and mysterious.\n*   **Feeling:** A sense of awe and slight intimidation due to the dragon's colossal size and intricate, formidable appearance. Suggests a world where advanced technology and ancient mythological creatures intertwine.\n\n**Overall Impression:** A stunning, detailed, and visually rich illustration of a mechanical steampunk dragon in a vast, open landscape, evoking a sense of wonder and adventure.",
    "refined_video_prompt": "The dragon subtly adjusts its wings, emitting gentle steam puffs. Its eyes slowly blink. Clouds drift idly. A distant bird realigns. The camera imperceptibly zooms out.",
    "creative_video_prompt_1": "Steampunk dragon roars, steam explodes! Its mechanical wings thrash, tearing through the sky. Brass gears grind, pipes rupture, spraying molten shrapnel. Eyes blaze, spewing fire. Clouds writhe, violently swirling and collapsing. Distant birds scatter, fleeing the chaos. The camera violently lurches, plunging forward into the tumultuous scene, then whips back.",
    "creative_video_prompt_2": "A colossal steampunk dragon, defying gravity, its mechanical wings pulsating backward creating swirling voids in the sky. Steam wails from its body, morphing into spectral birds that reform into golden gears. Eyes, luminous and shifting, reveal fleeting dimensions, its roar echoing backward through time, unraveling clouds into shimmering threads of light.",
    "creative_video_prompt_3": "A colossal steampunk dragon roars, its brass-laden body pulsating with gears and steam. A dramatic, sweeping crane shot reveals its intricate mechanical wings, adjusting with thunderous clicks. Focus on its glowing, observant eyes before a rapid zoom-out unveils its immense size against the vast, cloud-strewn skies. Birds scatter as it takes flight, its descent subtly shifting the distant landscape, a testament to its dramatic, powerful movement.",
