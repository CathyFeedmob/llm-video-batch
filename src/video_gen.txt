Here are a few options, ranging from more detailed to super concise, depending on the model's expected input length:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Action-Oriented):**

> Generate a video of a young woman in a modern anime style, diligently preparing food in a warm, sunlit kitchen. She has long dark hair, fair skin, and is shown in profile, eyes downcast in focus as her hands actively chop food with a knife on a counter. Strong warm sunlight streams from the right, casting sharp diagonal shadows across the room. On the gas stovetop, a black frying pan holds a sizzling sunny-side-up egg with visible steam rising. Other kitchen items like pots and utensils are arranged nearby. The art style features clean lines, soft shading, and a warm, inviting color palette, creating a tranquil and domestic atmosphere.

**Option 2 (More Concise):**

> Modern anime style video: A young woman with long dark hair, fair skin, focuses on chopping food with a knife in a sunlit kitchen. Warm sunlight casts sharp diagonal shadows. On the stove, a frying pan sizzles with a sunny-side-up egg and rising steam. Clean lines, soft shading, warm color palette convey domestic tranquility.

**Option 3 (Super Concise - Focus on core elements):**

> Anime style video: Young woman, long dark hair, chopping food in sunlit kitchen. Sizzling egg with steam on stove. Warm light, sharp shadows. Tranquil, clean lines, warm colors.

Choose the option that best fits the specific video generation model's capabilities and preferred prompt length. Option 1 is generally the safest for capturing most of the crucial details and actions.
